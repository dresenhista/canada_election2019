Reality Check: Liberals Spent Years Profiting off Student Debt Justin Trudeau’s government profited making billions of dollars off student debt, while young people struggled to get out from under crushing debt loads. “Justin Trudeau spent four years raking in billions of dollars in interest from young people who were just starting out in life, even while they were making sacrifices to make student loans payments every month — living at home, working two jobs, even putting off starting a family,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Trudeau and the Liberals let young people down. He gave a lot of fancy speeches about the next generation of Canadians — but never stopped reaching into their bank accounts and taking money away from them. Making a profit off student loans is wrong.” “Trudeau and the Liberals let young people down. He gave a lot of fancy speeches about the next generation of Canadians — but never stopped reaching into their bank accounts and taking money away from them. Making a profit off student loans is wrong.” The Liberals’ record on student debt shows how badly they’ve let down young Canadians: Total federal student debt is close to $17 billion dollars, while the Trudeau government has collected nearly $3 billion in interest payments from students since 2015.[1]
An internal government report called the student loan system “broken,” noting that the cost of education is growing faster than wages and higher costs of living are compounding the squeeze on young people.[2]
The average student debt burden is $26,000, takes between nine and 15 years to pay off, and payments can take up to 13% of graduates’ wages.[3]
The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that nearly half of students will have financial needs at or above student loan limits while in school by 2021.[4]
Four provinces have already eliminated their interest on their loans: British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. [5] ",2019-09-05

It’s Time for a New Deal for Northern Ontario Decades of Liberal and Conservative neglect of the North have hurt people. The NDP has a plan to make life more affordable for Northerners. SUDBURY – Today, NDP candidates Charlie Angus (Timmins-James Bay), Carol Hughes (Algoma–Manitoulin–Kapuskasing), Beth Mairs (Sudbury), Stef Paquette (Nickel Belt) and Rob Boulet (Nipissing-Timiskaming) announced a New Deal for Northern Ontario. For far too long, Northerners have been finding it harder to make ends meet. The Liberal and Conservative policies failed to address the significant challenges people face in the region, and the NDP knows it is time to do things differently. “Northern families are struggling to make ends meet while the Liberals are looking out for their corporate friends,” said Hughes. “In a country as rich as Canada, we need to do better, and we can do better. Liberals and Conservatives haven’t worked for us. Only Northern Ontario New Democrats have a plan to make life more affordable, advance reconciliation, and create jobs for the region.” Trudeau’s Liberals haven’t worked for Northern Ontario – they’ve made life more expensive and haven’t done enough on climate and to deliver better services for Indigenous communities. Andrew Scheer is just more of the same of what the North has gotten from Stephen Harper and Doug Ford – cuts to the services people need. “Both the Liberals and Conservatives have undermined the economic development of Northern Ontario by refusing to invest in FedNor and failing our people,” said Angus. “We will not sit idly by while our economy slows down because of their bad decisions. The NDP will give the North its due by finally making FedNor a stand-alone regional economic development agency. That's how we will pursue job growth, long-term development, and support the growth of co-operative, Indigenous, and community enterprises.” Creating jobs in the North, protecting our environment, and setting the terms of a true nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous people are all part of the NDP’s New Deal for Northern Ontario.

Liberals Should be Evicted for Phony Housing Promises Justin Trudeau likes to talk about housing. But the Parliamentary Budget Officer recently revealed that Justin Trudeau’s housing plan spends less as a percentage of GDP than the ten previous years under Stephen Harper, prompting Liberal housing lead Adam Vaughn to attack the independent PBO. Earlier this year, Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan got caught when they “double counted to rhetorical advantage” on the number of housing units they built. The Liberals didn’t mention “rent” once in their 2015 platform, and haven’t done anything to help renters during their four years in government. Nearly one in five Canadians spends more than 50% of their income on rent and utilities. The PBO also found that Trudeau’s government sent an additional $100 million to Ontario for housing programs, but allowed Doug Ford to cut funding for housing programs by $161 million, scrap rent control and slash funding to fight homelessness. On housing, Canadians can’t trust Justin Trudeau’s phony promises. ",2019-09-26

Trudeau Abandons Pharmacare 6 Days After Promising It It’s been 22 years since the Liberals first rolled out their pharmacare promise.

In fact, Trudeau’s platform can only muster one vague paragraph on the topic:
 The platform contains no details and no funding to back up Trudeau’s pretty words. Just six days after telling Canadians he would bring in pharmacare, Justin Trudeau has completely abandoned Canadians struggling with the cost of prescription drugs. ",2019-09-29

Justin Trudeau Refuses to Denounce Bernier’s Debate Participation Despite Neo-Nazi, Hate Group Ties This morning it was revealed that among the founding members of Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada are members of extreme far-right, anti-immigrant hate groups. These include a former member of neo-Nazi group the Soldiers of Odin and a prominent member of Islamophobic hate group Pegida Canada. Despite these disturbing developments, Justin Trudeau is refusing to call on the Independent Debate Commission to reconsider their decision to allow Maxime Bernier to participate in upcoming leaders’ debates. This morning a reporter asked: “This morning Global News published a story showing some of the founding signatories to the People’s Party of Canada have either current or past ties to neo-nazi groups, Soldiers of Odin, far right groups. In light of this, would you ask the debate commissioner to reconsider the decision to allow Mr. Bernier in the debate?” Trudeau refused to denounce Bernier’s participation, instead blaming Stephen Harper for being selective about which debates he attended back in 2015. Jagmeet Singh has written to the debate commission to advocate against Bernier’s participation. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “It’s disappointing that Justin Trudeau has refused to denounce Maxime Bernier’s participation in the debates, even after we learned that founding members of his party are members of known hate groups. Canadians expect Justin Trudeau to do everything possible to fight racism. He should be saying clearly that we should not be giving a national platform to hateful beliefs.” ",2019-09-23

NDP Lays Out Fiscal Plan For Pharmacare, Dental Care, More Affordability for Families OTTAWA – With the NDP’s New Deal for People, families will get the medicine and dental care they need, lower cell phone bills, homes they can afford, an end to interest on student loans, and concrete advances on the climate crisis. And to pay for it, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and the NDP will stop letting the super-wealthy get away with not paying their fair share of taxes. “The system is rigged. And the NDP is going to un-rig it to work better for everyday people,” said Singh. “With Justin Trudeau in charge, the economy works great for the big pharma companies who are making record profits, but it’s not working for families paying sky-high prices for prescription drugs. It works great for the rich and the powerful who got a $14 billion tax break, but not for people struggling to find an affordable place to live. And it works great for the big polluters, but not for the young people who are worried about what kind of earth they’re being left to live on. I’m going to fix that. My plan is all about changing who Ottawa works for, and I choose you.” On Thursday, Singh revealed the NDP’s six priorities the NDP will ensure the next government delivers. A national universal pharmacare plan and a national dental care plan, delivering affordability and better health to Canadians.
A home people can afford, including massive investments in housing, real action on money laundering and a tax on foreign speculators.
Beginning to tackle student debt, by taking all interest off of student loans, current and future.
Lower cell phone and internet bills, by capping prices.
A bold plan and concrete action to fight the climate crisis, ending the subsidies to big oil companies, committing to science-based targets and helping workers during the transition from fossil fuels.
Ensuring the super-wealthy are paying their fair share by introducing a super wealth tax, closing tax loopholes, and ending giveaways for the richest companies and individuals. Singh’s platform includes a Super-Wealth Tax on fortunes over $20 million; an end to offshore tax havens, legally used by the wealthy to avoid paying Canadian taxes; ending all fossil fuel subsidies; and ending tax loopholes. These measures raise progressive new revenues and ensure a declining debt-to-GDP over the four-year plan. Quick Facts Everything in the NDP plan is additional to existing spending and programs.
The NDP plan does not raise taxes on middle or lower-income Canadians.
The Parliamentary Budget Officer has costed all the NDP’s revenue measures.
Debt-to-GDP ratio falls every year under the NDP’s four-year plan.
The NDP plan includes a Contingency Fund, equal to 15% of revenues every year. This is to make up for any shortfalls in revenue. ",2019-10-11

NDP Commits to Undoing Liberal Disappointments for Indigenous Peoples Jagmeet Singh and Chief Rudy Turtle campaign in Grassy Narrows GRASSY NARROWS — NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and the NDP candidate for Kenora, Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle, were in Grassy Narrows Saturday to talk about the New Democrats’ commitment to reconciliation and undoing the wake of disappointment Justin Trudeau and the Liberals have left in First Nations communities. In 2015, Trudeau promised a new relationship with Indigenous peoples, but four years later Indigenous people have been let down and even mocked by the Liberal Leader. “Mr. Trudeau said all the right things about reconciliation — but reconciliation is about action to make people’s lives better, not just pretty words,” said Singh. “The way Mr. Trudeau has treated Indigenous people hasn’t matched up with his words or promises.” On Friday, the federal government announced it is taking First Nations children to court, appealing a ruling that said the government ""willfully and recklessly'' discriminated against them — prompting Singh to say there’s no excuse that justifies the Trudeau Liberals taking First Nations children to court and demanding Trudeau drop the appeal. And in Grassy Narrows, 50 years ago, toxic chemicals were dumped into the English River system in a corporate crime that left generations of families suffering from mercury poisoning. Trudeau has failed to sign an agreement to help the community care for those suffering the effects of the poison. Meanwhile, when a Grassy Narrows community member confronted the Liberal leader at a party fundraiser, Trudeau mockingly shot back: “Thank you for your donation.” “For First Nations people who were hopeful, the trust has been broken. We’ve been let down,” said Turtle. “The people of Grassy Narrows deserve the kind of care and treatment we would all want for our families. And from coast-to-coast-to-coast, First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities have been left waiting for clean water, decent housing and safe schools where the next generation can get a good start. Indigenous children can’t wait another four years.” Singh and New Democrats have committed to building a treatment centre for Grassy Narrows residents affected by long-term mercury exposure, working with the Nation’s leadership and the community. Singh’s New Deal for People also commits to lifting all drinking water advisories for good by 2021 in First Nations communities, and implementing Shannen’s Dream, which spells out equitable access to education, backed by federal investments and infrastructure, so no students are forced into schools that aren’t safe.

The Liberals, like the Conservatives before them, are gradually destroying our supply management system and the vitality of our agriculture system. Supply management has been the lifeblood of our regions, and it contributes to our food sovereignty. We should be proud of the system we implemented, and we must protect it, not use it as a bargaining chip during trade negotiations. New Democrats are not afraid to stand up to our trade partners to protect dairy farmers and the supply management system. We did it for CETA, for diafiltered milk, for CPTPP, for CUSMA and you can continue to count on us to stand up and speak out against any further concessions to the dairy sector. As government, we commit to never opening more breaches during future free trade negotiations. After promising to fully compensate the dairy industry, the Liberals announced a package that doesn’t make a clear long-term commitment over the first year in terms of direct paid compensations to producers and does not fully cover the losses incurred by CETA and CPTPP. And this, a couple of weeks before an election. The Liberals forgot about small processors and did not take any concrete commitment for compensation due to losses from CUSMA. The NDP is committed to fully compensating producers for losses due to all trade deals including CUSMA.

One Year Later: Sears Retirees Getting Ripped Off While Trudeau Sides with Corporation New Democrats want a new deal for Sears Canada retirees OTTAWA – On the first year anniversary of when retirees officially had their pensions slashed by 30 percent following the bankruptcy and closure of Sears Canada, the NDP is still fighting for a new deal for these workers. When the company shut down its doors in 2018, 18,000 retirees discovered the pension plans built with their money would not pay out as planned. The NDP’s New Deal for People will ensure that pensioners are at the front of the line when a company goes bankrupt – making sure unfunded pension liabilities owed to workers, and employees’ severance pay, are the top priority. “If it wasn’t for the Liberals letting big corporations off the hook for pension theft, Sears Canada workers would not have to carry the weight of legal fees to fight for what is rightfully theirs,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Liberals and Conservatives turned their back on workers to make life easier for a big company and their executives.” The NDP's plan will stop companies from paying out bosses when people’s pensions are underfunded, and will create a mandatory, industry-financed pension insurance program. NDP Critic for Pensions, Scott Duvall (Hamilton Mountain), introduced a bill in the House of Commons that aimed to change bankruptcy and insolvency law to stop pension theft by big corporations. “Trudeau’s Liberals and Scheer’s Conservatives have done nothing to help workers whose pensions have been taken away from them because of corporate greed,” said Duvall. “Instead of strengthening support for Canadian workers and retirees, they have sided with rich corporations to undermine retirement benefits. This is wrong. New Democrats believe that every Canadian should be able to count on a dignified, secure retirement – and we’ll fight hard to protect pensions that workers have earned.” ",2019-08-08

$700 for Every Canadian: Why Won’t Justin Trudeau Close Tax Havens? In June, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) found that Canada is losing up to $25 billion in revenue every year from offshore tax havens. That’s nearly $700 for every Canadian. The PBO report also indicates that provisions in the Income Tax Act prevent the Canada Revenue Agency from disclosing relevant tax data for individual companies, making it impossible for the PBO or the public to assess whether individual companies are avoiding Canadian taxes. Currently, corporations have no obligation to prove that transactions to transfer funds between Canada and other jurisdictions have an economic purpose aside from reducing the amount of taxes owed in Canada. The NDP attempted to fix this by introducing legislation that would require companies to demonstrate that such transactions have an economic substance. Justin Trudeau and the Liberals have refused to address this problem. While these companies avoid billions in taxes, Canadians are struggling with rising costs like prescription drugs and housing. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau has chosen the rich and powerful over everyday Canadians. He’s refusing to crack down on big corporations that aren’t paying their share of Canadian taxes.

Conservatives Say One Thing and Do Another on Corporate Giveaways Andrew Scheer’s talk on corporate welfare might sound familiar to Canadians. While Stephen Harper was in opposition, he promised he would take on “corporate welfare bums.” But in government, Harper actually continued the corporate gravy train. In fact, corporate tax revenue as a percentage of GDP fell by 23%. And both Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau broke their promises to end fossil fuel subsidies. Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau is saying some pretty words about taxing the rich while giving $14 billion to profitable corporations. Both the Liberal and Conservative records are clear: they give tax breaks to corporations and make everyone else pay for it. After years of Liberal and Conservative government, Canada’s richest 87 families own the same amount as the lowest earning 12 million Canadians combined. Jagmeet Singh’s New Deal for People ensures the ultra-rich and profitable corporations pay their share so we can make life more affordable for everyone. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “At election time, Liberals and Conservatives like to pretend they’ll take on big corporations. But after years of Liberal and Conservative governments, the ultra-rich are better off than ever while other Canadians are struggling. It’s time to ensure big corporations pay their share so we can make life more affordable for people.” ",2019-09-18

Another Study Highlights How Universal Pharmacare Will Help People Make Ends Meet NDP will immediately bring in a universal, comprehensive pharmacare program in 2020 OTTAWA – Today, NDP candidate Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway) is highlighting the release of a study done by St. Michael’s Hospital’s MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions that found that providing Ontarians with free access to essential medicines improves medicine adherence, control of blood pressure and control of diabetes. The report also found that there is a large increase – from 33 % to 86% – in people’s ability to ""make ends meet"" and afford basic necessities such as food and rent when access to medicine is provided. “Across Canada, people are having to make impossible choices every day – cutting pills in half, choosing between paying rent or filling their prescription, or going without the drugs they need altogether,” said Davies. “It doesn’t have to be this way. Trudeau’s Liberals could have chosen to stand up for Canadians and bring in drug coverage, but instead they listened to lobbyists and chose not to act. New Democrats will do the right thing and invest in Canadians' health.” Even though experts say we could have better health care, lower costs, and savings for families, pharmacare has been stalled for years. The Conservatives spent a decade making the problem worse. And Trudeau’s Liberal government let big pharmaceutical and insurance companies keep charging Canadians some of the highest drug prices in the world. “Justin Trudeau told Canadians he’d help, but behind closed doors, he listened to his insider friends. Canadians deserve better,” said Davies. “They deserve leaders with the courage to stand up to big pharmaceutical and insurance companies, and work for a solution that will make life better for everyday people. We know we can cover every Canadian through our public system, and save families more than $500 a year.""

How Justin Trudeau Helped Doug Ford Cut Services At election time, Justin Trudeau likes to talk about fighting Conservatives. But a closer look at his record shows that he actually let Doug Ford cut affordable housing in Ontario. A recent Parliamentary Budget Office report showed that Trudeau left a giant loophole in his National Housing Strategy. The PBO found that because Trudeau didn’t require provincial matching funds to be additional to the province’s current housing spending levels, Doug Ford was actually able to cut housing funding by $161 million this year, despite receiving federal housing money. The PBO wrote:
		“Provinces and territories that already spend more than the federal government on housing could reduce funding for housing programs while still meeting the cost-matching requirements... Ontario’s 2019-20 Main Estimates reduced operating spending on housing programs from $944 million in 2018-19 to $866 million in 2019-20, and capital spending from $302 million to $219 million, despite $0.1 billion in additional funding provided to Ontario by CMHC in 2019-20.” (PBO, June Report) This policy allows the Liberals to talk about increasing affordable housing investments without any guarantee that affordable housing spending will actually go up. So where did Trudeau’s money go? While Ford cut services, he also cancelled a surtax on the rich, saving the highest-earning Ontarians $275 million a year. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau likes to talk about how bad Conservatives are, but he’s chosen to let Doug Ford cut services for people and give tax breaks to the rich. People can’t afford four more years of Justin Trudeau’s empty promises. I’ll fight hard to stop Conservative cuts all the time, not just during an election campaign.” ",2019-10-03

NDP Plan Helps Prevent Gang Crime Jagmeet Singh takes action for people where Justin Trudeau has failed SURREY – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh unveiled his plan today to tackle rising organized crime in B.C. and keep our kids out of gangs, taking action where Liberals have refused to act. “People in Surrey are worried about the future for their kids, but instead of listening, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals chose to spend $4.5 billion of your money on a pipeline while leaving British Columbians to tackle crime alone,” said Singh. “New Democrats have the courage to take a different approach. It’s time to look out for kids and protect our communities from the rising gang violence and organized crime that’s hurting everyday families in B.C.” An NDP government will create a $100 million fund dedicated to helping keep young people out of gangs, with a boost to programs that get youth involved in their community. New Democrats will also immediately create a dedicated RCMP anti-money laundering unit and put an end to hidden corporate ownership of real estate, to help crack down on tax evasion and fraud. “Young people who’ve been left behind need someone on their side. Preventing gang activity and tackling the housing crisis – those are the priorities of families here in Surrey and they need a government in Ottawa that takes them seriously,” said Singh. “We’re replacing empty talk with concrete action, because New Democrats are in it for you.” The NDP’s New Deal for People also gets results for B.C. families by investing in more affordable housing and fighting the climate crisis. New Democrats will safeguard the coast from the increased risk of oil spills, as a result of the high tanker traffic permitted by the Liberals, which would only be worsened by Big Oil-backed Conservatives and the Green Party that won’t rule out supporting them.

Trudeau Refuses to Take on Conservative Premiers on Child Care This morning at the Toronto Star editorial board, Justin Trudeau dodged repeated questions from journalists on his refusal to commit to a national affordable child care program. When asked why the Liberal government wasn’t taking action on child care, Trudeau passed the buck to provincial governments: “We can’t take on things that fundamentally it’s been shown, can be ably led, and should be ably led by the provinces.” (Video) Journalists pressed Trudeau on the “double standard” of promising to take action on pharmacare (a provincial responsibility) while refusing to push the provinces on child care. Trudeau refused to directly answer the question. Trudeau’s decision to pass the buck to the provinces is a sharp departure from his 2015 commitment to “to deliver affordable, high-quality, flexible, and fully inclusive child care for Canadian families.” As Child Care Now pointed out, Liberals have objectively not even tried to respect their promise. (1) But as Trudeau refuses to help families with child care costs, even Liberal MP Wayne Long recently described child care costs as a “crisis situation” and a recent study by the Canadian Centre for Policy alternatives found that child care fees have risen faster than inflation in 61% of Canadian cities. (2) An NDP government would invest $1 billion in 2020 and grow that investment annually to reduce child care costs for families. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “At a time when families are struggling with rising child care costs, they need a Prime Minister who isn’t afraid to take on Doug Ford and other conservatives. Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau is showing that despite his nice words, he’s refusing to actually stand up for Canadians struggling with the cost of living. It’s time for a government that is willing to show real leadership to make life better for people. Families should not have to choose between having kids and having a career.” ",2019-09-05

Trudeau Doubles Down on Trade Negotiations with Brazil’s Bolsonaro While the Amazon Burns NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh released the following statement in response to Justin Trudeau’s refusal to stop negotiating a new free trade deal with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and the Mercosur group of nations. Last week, Singh called on Trudeau to stop negotiations to pressure Bolsonaro to change course to save the Amazon rainforest: “The Amazon rainforest is burning, and that’s not a crisis only for Brazil, it’s a crisis for humankind and for our planet. Once again, Justin Trudeau is putting the interest of rich corporations ahead of the fight against climate change by continuing free trade negotiations with President Bolsonaro. Last week, I called on Justin Trudeau to stop trade negotiations with President Bolsonaro in order to put real pressure on Brazil’s leadership to stop deforestation and start accepting help to fight these devastating fires. Trudeau has refused. Even as France and Ireland say they’ll block an EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement if Brazil doesn’t honour its environmental responsibilities, Trudeau keeps negotiating with Bolsonaro as if the earth isn’t burning up around them. This is another disturbing example of Justin Trudeau saying and tweeting pretty things in public, when behind closed doors he's doing business with the person responsible for the deforestation and devastation of the lungs of the planet. Experts have been clear: economic sanctions are the best tool we have to put pressure on President Bolsonaro, especially after he refused the help offered by the G7 members. Trudeau needs to make his trade policy match his words. Canada shouldn’t be doing business with Bolsonaro while the Amazon burns, no matter how much the rich could profit.” ",2019-08-27

Trudeau Has Net-Zero Credibility on Climate Change Based on Justin Trudeau’s record, his phony promises on the climate crisis can’t be trusted. His 2015 platform promised “we will end the cycle of federal parties – of all stripes – setting arbitrary targets without a real federal/provincial/territorial plan in place.” But then the Liberals adopted Stephen Harper’s targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and are on path to meet them 200 years late. After the pressure of big polluters, Justin Trudeau gave them a carbon pricing exemption, delayed the Clean Fuel Standard and methane regulations until after the election. Under Justin Trudeau, Canada continues to spend around $3.3 billion a year on subsidies for big oil and gas companies, produce more greenhouse gas emissions per person than any other G20 economy and warm twice as fast as the rest of the world. The Liberal commitment to introduce legislated targets for emissions reductions could have been implemented more than a decade ago – if the Liberal-dominated Senate hadn’t let Jack Layton’s private member’s bill C-377 The Climate Change Accountability Act die on the order paper. And they blew past the 1997 Kyoto Protocol’s emissions targets by 30%. After over two decades of broken Liberal promises, the Liberals today released a phony climate plan with no details, saying they need to consult an “expert panel” after the election.

NDP Stands Up For Good-Paying Jobs in Canada OSHAWA – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in Oshawa today to talk about his strategy for retaining and attracting the good-paying auto jobs that workers in communities across Ontario’s manufacturing heartland rely on. Oshawa is bracing for the loss of thousands of jobs when vehicle production ends at the local GM plant this year. “Workers should never, ever feel abandoned by their government – but the Liberals and Conservatives have left workers in Oshawa on their own to deal with these devastating job cuts,” said Singh. “New Democrats will always support the auto sector, but we’ll do it with strings attached – jobs need to stay here in Canada.” Oshawa’s story isn’t unique. Communities across southern Ontario have seen hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs disappear on the watch of Liberal and Conservative governments alike. In some cases, rich companies have been allowed to walk away from Canadian workers after pocketing billions of dollars in tax breaks. “Auto workers deserve better than Liberal and Conservative only show up once the jobs have been lost,” said Singh. “Workers deserve a government that’s on their side, with a plan to attract and keep good-paying auto jobs in the long run. I’m ready to fight to make sure that we’re building the cars of the future right here in Ontario.” Singh vowed to establish a National Automotive Strategy to help attract and retain investment in the sector.

Families Can’t Go Four More Years Without Drug and Dental Care NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says charging for medicine means families ‘pay up or get sick’ SASKATOON – Decades of Conservative and Liberal governments siding with big pharma, instead of with everyday Canadians, means families are forced to pay up, or get sick — and families can’t go four more years without drug and dental coverage, said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Because of Justin Trudeau’s choices, there are Canadians who sit at the kitchen table and cut their pills in half to make the bottle last longer,” said Singh. “There are moms and dads who have to make the heartbreaking decision to put off getting their kid’s cavity filled because money’s tight. Families can’t go four more years without the medicine they need. They can’t go four more years without getting their teeth checked.” Rather than expanding health care, the Conservatives would cut and squeeze health care even more. Justin Trudeau promised to help the middle class but did nothing to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, housing or other costs — and, as a result, families are falling further behind. Singh said it’s no surprise Trudeau won’t implement a universal pharmacare plan, since the record shows the Trudeau government has met behind closed doors with pharmaceutical and insurance companies more than 850 times. “No wonder the Liberals have blocked pharmacare and dental coverage. They’re not working for you, and I want people to know that you don’t have to settle for that. No one should have to spend four more years being forced to choose between paying up, or letting their family get sick,” said Singh. “People need a New Deal. Not Conservative cuts that would cost families more and force more folks to end up in jam-packed hospitals. Not a plan to keep protecting the profits of big pharma. A plan to make life affordable and healthy for you and your kids.” Singh’s platform commits to introducing a national universal pharmacare plan by the end of 2020, saving each family more than $500 a year, even if they already have insurance; and a dental plan to provide coverage for millions of families.

Justin Trudeau says he agrees there is a climate crisis, but he doesn’t seem to get it. He’s spent billions on a pipeline, while under-funding support for communities impacted by disasters like flooding,” says Singh. “We can do better for people. We have a bold climate plan that replaces pretty words with real action.” In 2015, the Conservative government raised the threshold for provinces to qualify for federal compensation for disasters – and the Trudeau Liberals not only kept this change but also purchased the Trans-Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion, while leaving communities scrambling for funding to fight flooding and forest fires. “The Liberals promise one thing during election, and deliver another in government. While families here in Gatineau and across the country struggle with the growing threat of floods and other climate-related disasters, Justin Trudeau was more focused on buying a pipeline than on getting them help,” added Singh. “We’re going to make different choices.

Including dental care in our health care system for those who don’t get the care they need will help millions of Canadians. ""No one should have to deal with the pain or lifelong damage of going without dental care,"" said Singh. ""Some people have workplace insurance plans – but millions of Canadians don't have any dental coverage at all. Trudeau's Liberals refuse to even consider helping these Canadians. This doesn't make sense. We need to ensure people are getting the care they need."" Millions of Canadians don’t visit the dentist every year because they can't afford to. Liberals and Conservatives chose to ignore these needs. New Democrats will work together with provincial partners and health professionals to expand Medicare to include dental services. ""Our Denticare plan is a down payment on Tommy Douglas' vision – comprehensive dental care as part of our healthcare system,"" added Singh. ""Unlike the Liberals and the Conservatives, New Democrats are going to help people who need it, right now."" This is all part of the NDP's New Deal for People to make life more affordable for families, young people and seniors. Facts Our plan will extend public dental care coverage to 4.3 million Canadians.
We will put in place a national dental care plan to help uninsured Canadians with household incomes below $90,000, starting right away in 2020.
Dental care will be free for housholds making under $70,000, with a sliding copayment for those who earn between $70,000 and $90,000.
Under the NDP’s Denticare plan, a family of four that has a household income of $70,000 or less would save at least $1,240 if they received the recommended dental examinations and cleanings in a single year, and if each child was treated for a single cavity.
Our Denticare plan is a first step towards Tommy Douglas’ vision – comprehensive dental care as part of our healthcare system. He championed the idea more than thirty years ago: ""The ultimate goal of Medicare must be to keep people well rather than just patching them up when they get sick... It means expanding and improving Medicare by providing pharmacare and denticare programs."" (The Future of Medicare, 1984)
Almost 20% of Canadians avoid the dentist every year because of the cost.
Ignoring dental care needs end up costing our health care system. Emergency room visits because of dental emergencies cost taxpayers at least $155 million annually but often don’t address underlying dental issues, leading to return visits and ongoing pressures on our health care system.
The Liberals have refused to even consider helping Canadians with their dental care needs. In fact, Liberal Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor recently said, with respect to dental care, that “no federal investments are being made”. ",2019-09-18

5 times Justin Trudeau Sided with Rich Friends and Corporations over Canadians Justin Trudeau chooses to side with his wealthy friends again and again. Here are 5 times Justin Trudeau sided with the richest people and corporations, and made Canadians pay the price: 1. Big Pharma
		Canadians are paying some of the highest prices in the world for their medication – about 25% more than the median price people in other developed countries pay for the same drugs. (Health Canada, 9 Aug 2019) Justin Trudeau’s Liberals met with big pharmaceutical and insurance companies 850 times while refusing to take real action on pharmacare. 2. Big Telecoms
		Canadians are stuck paying some of the highest cell phone and internet prices in the world. (Government of Canada, 21 Dec 2018) Trudeau’s Liberals met with telecom lobbyists 550 times. The result is an almost fifty million dollar break for Bell, Rogers and Telus while Canadians are stuck with sky high cell phone and internet bills. 3. Big Oil
		Justin Trudeau told Canadians he would take on climate change. Instead, he broke his promise to end billions in fossil fuel subsidies and bought a $4.5 billion pipeline on the public dime – all while meeting 1,500 times with oil company lobbyists. 4. Real Estate Speculators
		Housing prices are skyrocketing out of reach for Canadians. One-in-five renters are being forced to put more than half of their paycheque into housing. (Georgia Straight) Justin Trudeau has refused to take on the wealthy speculators that treat housing as a cash source, not a place to live. 5. SNC-Lavalin
		And while Justin Trudeau refuses to work for Canadians, he’s been showing people who he does work for – big corporations with connections, like SNC-Lavalin. And just this morning, he blocked the RCMP’s efforts to look into obstruction of justice allegations. Again and again, Justin Trudeau has shown that despite his pretty words, he always puts the wealthy and well-connected first. ",2019-09-11

Trudeau Violated Ethics Law to Further Corporate, Partisan Interests Ethics Commissioner reveals that the Prime Minister acted inappropriately VICTORIA – In a bombshell report responding to a complaint launched by the NDP, Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion revealed today that Prime Minister Trudeau broke the law to further the interests of SNC-Lavalin and the Liberal Party. “It is absolutely outrageous that Prime Minister Trudeau violated the trust of Canadians to further the interests of his corporate friends. This report proves that the Liberal government has put the wealthy and the well-connected above the law – and the Prime Minister himself is directly responsible,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. Commissioner Dion was clear that SNC-Lavalin “overwhelmingly stood to benefit from Ms. Wilson-Raybould's intervention”, and that he has “no doubt that the result of Mr. Trudeau's influence would have furthered SNC-Lavalin's interests”. He concluded that Trudeau’s actions were against the constitutional principles of prosecutorial independence and the rule of law. “Justin Trudeau is not who he pretends to be,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay). “Behind closed doors, we now have proof that this Prime Minister went so far as to break the law to cut backroom deals for his corporate friends and to benefit his political party. It’s absolutely unacceptable that the Prime Minister has been twice found in violation of the Conflict of Interest Act, a first. Canadians are rightly outraged.” In A New Deal for People, Singh has pledged that a New Democrat government would formally prohibit corporations facing criminal charges from lobbying elected officials.

Why won’t Justin Trudeau’s Liberals tax the ultra-rich? In 2015, Justin Trudeau gave Canadians some pretty words about taxing the rich: ""I'm asking those with the most to do a little bit more to help those in Canada with less."" (CBC, 11 May 2015) And in 2017, he promised to crack down on tax dodgers: ""it is absolutely unacceptable that there be people not paying their fair share of taxes."" (CBC, 3 March 2017) Time and time again, he has talked about taxing the rich and closing tax loopholes. But his words haven’t been followed by action. You don’t have to look too hard to see why: Under Justin Trudeau, the top 1% are his senior advisors and backers. Although Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s exact net worth is unknown, he indicated in 2017 that he owned $21 million shares in Morneau Sheppell. He was forced to sell those shares after weeks of controversy for bringing in pension reforms that could have directly benefited his company and hurt workers. (National Post, 21 Nov 2017) We know from coverage of the Paradise Papers that Trudeau’s fundraising chief Stephen Bronfman was involved in “multimillion-dollar cashflows” to offshore havens in the Cayman Islands to potentially avoid Canadian taxes. (The Guardian, 5 Nov 2017) Minister of Infrastructure and Communities François-Philippe Champagne was a director of Bionest and reportedly personally approved the transfer of payments to tax shelters in the Turks and Caicos. (Journal de Montréal, 21 Apr 2016) It’s clear that despite his nice words, Justin Trudeau has refused to stand up to the rich interests who aren’t paying their share of taxes.

Over a decade, the Super-Wealth tax will raise almost $70 billion to fund a New Deal for People. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh:

NDP’s Rudy Turtle Reacts to Liberal's Failure to Reach Agreement with Grassy Narrows KENORA – NDP candidate Rudy Turtle (Kenora) condemned Trudeau's Liberals failure to reach an agreement over an on-reserve care facility for people in Grassy Narrows First Nation suffering from the effects of mercury poisoning before the dissolution of Parliament. Trudeau’s Liberals had years to come to an agreement and solve the problem, but they didn’t. “Children and elders are suffering from mercury poisoning every day in Grassy Narrows,” said Turtle. “Justin Trudeau promised to build a treatment center to help our people. He had four years to fix the problem, but he failed. This isn’t how Reconciliation works.” Grassy Narrows families have suffered from mercury poisoning because of a corporate chemical-dumping crime that poisoned the English and Wabigoon rivers in the 1960s and ‘70s. The Liberal government promised a much-needed mercury care facility to care for the sickest residents — but has been stalling, trying to get away with delivering much less than promised, or perhaps nothing at all. “Conservative and Liberal governments came and left, and the people of Grassy Narrows are still getting sick,” added Turtle. “When elected, I will work in Ottawa to ensure that Grassy Narrows is heard so we can finally build a treatment center to help people suffering from mercury poisoning and clean the river.” For New Democrats, Reconciliation is at the heart of our work. We will honour our treaties, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, close the health gap and renew the relationship between Canada and First Nations with an Action Plan on Reconciliation. Facts An independent study by Japanese researchers found that more than 90% of people in Grassy Narrows and nearby Wabaseemoong suffer from symptoms of mercury poisoning.
A 2015 scientific report found that there is ongoing contamination in lakes and rivers upstream of Grassy Narrows.
A 2018 report found that mercury exposure was linked to serious issues in children's health, including learning disabilities, language or speech disorders, anemia, and visual problems.
Only 6% of people in Grassy Narrows currently receive compensation from the mercury disability board, which relies on outdated medical criteria to assess eligibility.
Justin Trudeau promised in 2017 to solve the issue ""once and for all,"" and then called it ""very much a provincial issue"" two months later.
Earlier this year, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau sarcastically thanked protesters from Grassy Narrows for their donation at an exclusive event for well-heeled Liberal donors. ",2019-09-12

Cancellation of Bell Service shows Liberal Failure: NDP Liberals are more interested in protecting corporate profits than serving Canadians WINDSOR — Today, NDP Critic for Innovation, Science, and Economic Development, Brian Masse (Windsor West), pointed to Bell Canada’s cancellation of the planned service rollout to 200,000 households as proof that the Liberals are failing to create more competition in the telecom sector to make life more affordable for people. “You can’t have a real plan to deal with telecom affordability and service without the courage to take on the well-connected telecom giants,” stated Masse.  “What’s shocking isn’t that the Liberals’ plan failed, but that it failed in just four days. Bell’s display of corporate greed to save a rounding error in their revenue is leading them to abandon 200,000 underserved Canadian households. Bell’s customers wait on hold longer than it took them to protect their price gouging.” Bell announced this week that it will reduce its broadband Internet build-out for smaller towns and rural communities, abandoning 200,000 households, in response to a CRTC decision that lowered wholesale rates for third-party Internet resellers. “For decades, Conservative and Liberal governments have abandoned Canadian consumers by allowing unfair competition to fester in the telecom market,” said Masse. “The result is that Canadians pay among the highest prices in the world for cellphone and internet service, while those living in rural and remote communities have no service at all. The Liberals’ plan will protect telecom company profits while doing nothing to guarantee Canadians wireless or high-speed internet access.” New Democrats believe that no matter where you live in Canada, you should be able to stay connected – without breaking the bank over unfair gouging.

The promise had no timelines and funding fell far short of what would be needed for a real pharmacare program. Canadians know that the Liberals can’t be trusted to bring in pharmacare – they’ve been promising to introduce pharmacare since 1997. After the election, it never materializes.

We don't want four years of negotiations to take place, we want implementation and people need to know, in fact is pharmacare going to be implemented or not?” (Jane Philpott on CTV) “There’s a real concern around the dollar figure attached to this… they certainly fall short of what both the Hoskins report recommended and what the Parliamentary Budget Officer has recommended.” (Jane Philpott on CTV) “Today’s announcement contains no additional commitments or implementation details…. [Canadians] deserve to know how the party that set the process in motion plans to deliver on its promise.” (Canadian Doctors for Medicare) “When it came to pharmacare, they let a lot slide off the table.

At the Kingston Farmer’s Market, Singh talked with local farmers about how the changing climate is impacting them, as growing conditions become more unpredictable. Despite the importance of our food system in confronting the climate crisis, Liberal and Conservative governments have left farmers to struggle with a rapidly changing climate and mounting financial stress on their own – while Canadian families want more access to local food. “When we support local farmers – everyone wins.

NDP Worried about Liberals Secretive Plans to Privatize Airport Security Screening BRAMPTON – Today, the NDP is calling on Justin Trudeau’s Liberals to stop the privatization of Canadian Airport Transportation Security Authority (CATSA) behind closed doors and without worker representatives. Workers’ knowledge and years of experience absolutely need to be taken into account before government makes major modifications. “This government has chosen to ignore stakeholders and instead rely on the biased opinions of those they hire to justify privatization. This consultation process has not been open or transparent. It is shameful that workers and their representatives have not been included at all stages of this transition. The knowledge and expertise CATSA workers and their representatives have is crucial to protecting public interest and public money,” said NDP candidate Saranjit Singh (Brampton East). Not only would privatization result in higher ticket prices and erode safety standards, it would also have major impacts on workers. The Liberals show a complete lack of understanding about the effects these changes will have for workers and the traveling public. “Trudeau needs to give assurance that privatization of services will not impact the cost of travel for Canadians as well of the quality of security services,” said Stan Pickthall, General Vice-President of IAMAW. “Time and time again, we have seen Trudeau favouring the interests of big businesses and trading them for the interests of ordinary Canadians. The Liberals are working in coordination with Scheer’s Conservatives to ensure worker’s input is bypassed. Let’s make sure this will not happen again.” The NDP believes that CATSA’s funding model should be reviewed to make it stable and predictable to ensure that international standards are met. A New Democrat government commits to review the Liberals’ decision and make sure to put the interest of workers and Canadians first. – 30 – Facts: From January to July, 2019, 29.4 million passengers passed through Canada’s busiest hub, Toronto Pearson International Airport, an increase from last year.

From the 44-hour work week to paid maternity leave, many significant battles have been fought and won. New Democrats are proud to have walked with labour all these decades. But the fight to defend workers is not over. Precarious jobs are on the rise, wages are stagnating, and everyday costs are rising.

Millions of Canadians are struggling to pay the bills every month – even when they work full time. While the cost of housing, medication, and other necessities have skyrocketed, wages haven’t kept up – and that’s because decades of Liberal and Conservative governments have sided with big corporations instead of people.

Reality Check: Conservatives Open to Bending the Rules for Corporate Friends Scheer too cozy with big corporation to speak out OTTAWA – When it comes to standing up for Canadians and the rule of law against powerful corporate interests, it’s clear that Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives would have chosen their insider friends from SNC-Lavalin too. Andrew Scheer met with SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce to discuss deferred prosecution agreements as recently as May 2018. (Toronto Star, Feb. 10 2019)
Following that meeting, Scheer would not speak out against a secret deal for SNC-Lavalin: “when asked if Scheer had a position on whether SNC-Lavalin should get such a deal, Harrison would only say that Scheer ‘is opposed to politicians interfering to get charges dropped for accused corporate criminals.’” (Toronto Star, Feb. 10 2019).
In March 2019, Scheer continued to sidestep the question of what he would do when companies break the law, saying that deferred prosecution agreements are “not the issue” he’s concerned with in regard to the SNC-Lavalin controversy. (Global News, March 23 2019)
Scheer’s reluctance to take on corporations that break the law isn’t surprising when you consider the Conservative record: in 2013 it was revealed that at least three companies had been given federal contracts despite violating government integrity policies (iPolitics, June 4 2013) – and in May 2015, the CEO of SNC-Lavalin stated that he had made efforts to seek a settlement with the previous government in order to avoid a lengthy criminal trial. (Trudeau II Report, p. 11) But the coziness between big corporations and Scheer’s Conservatives does not stop there: In April 2019, the Conservatives opposed an NDP motion opposing corporate influence over the Government of Canada (Vote No. 1299)

Trudeau has told renters to wait for help, while spending 4.5 billion taxpayer dollars on a pipeline and refusing to take on the money laundering and speculation that has driven up housing prices in B.C. “We know it will take time to build the affordable housing people need; this is about getting families that are hurting the most relief right away – not waiting a decade from now, like the Liberals are proposing,” said Singh. The NDP’s New Deal for People also delivers a bold plan to fight the climate crisis, lower cell phone bills, and provide dental care and universal prescription drug coverage to make life more affordable for families in B.C. and across Canada. – 30 – Facts: According to an analysis by the PBO, the Liberals’ National Housing Strategy spends 19% less on affordable housing as a proportion of GDP than the previous 10 years, including under the Conservatives. [1]
Experts have accused the Liberals of double-counting funding and actually helping fewer low-income people than in the past. [2]
The Liberals' “Canada Housing Benefit” is too small and too late.
It won’t be fully phased-in to cover 300,000 families until 2027-28 – almost a full decade from now.
An average benefit of $2,500 won’t actually close the gap between people’s incomes and affordable rent, the PBO found. [3]
The NDP’s rental benefit will start immediately and offer a benefit of up to $5,000 per household to as many as 500,000 families who need it most.
The federal contribution to this benefit will be $1.35 billion per year, with $450 million coming from the provinces.
The rental benefit is in addition to the NDP’s plan create 500,000 quality, affordable homes in the next ten years and provide energy-efficient retrofits to save families money and reduce emissions. ",2019-09-26

NDP Highlights Liberal Failures on Housing Trudeau spending less on affordable housing than Harper OTTAWA – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pledged his support for families struggling with the high cost of housing and underscored the Liberal government’s failure to provide the help people need on affordable housing. “Across this country, I hear from people struggling to keep a roof over their heads. They tell me they lie awake at night worrying that they won’t be able to make ends meet each month,”said Singh. “I meet young moms and dads, students, and seniors who have seen things get worse over the last four years as the Liberals ignored the housing crisis. I’m here to tell them, New Democrats see you and we’re on your side.” Years of Liberal and Conservative governments have forced Canadians to fend for themselves as housing costs go up and the availability of suitable places to live goes down. The Parliamentary Budget Officer recently found that the Liberals’ National Housing Strategy will spend 19% less on affordable housing as a percentage of nominal GDP than the ten years previous. “The economy is doing well, but not for everyone,” said Singh. “We need to do better to make sure that everyone has a safe and affordable place to call home. That’s why New Democrats will make affordable housing a priority, and work with communities to expand and improve existing housing, to reduce energy demand, create jobs and save people money every single month.” Jagmeet’s New Deal for People is a bold plan to address the housing crisis which the Liberals have neglected for the last four years. The NDP’s plan includes a pledge to build 500,000 new affordable homes across the country within a decade, as well as help for no-cost energy efficiency upgrades that will save money and create jobs.

Trudeau’s Shameful Record of Failing Indigenous Children In 2015, Justin Trudeau made big promises to make life better for Indigenous children. Instead, he fought continuously in court to avoid funding Indigenous child welfare. Since being ordered in 2016 by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to fix the discriminatory underfunding of Indigenous child services, Trudeau’s government has been hit with four non-compliance orders and 48 children in Ontario have died. But last year, he found $14 billion to give away to big corporations. This is just the latest in a long list of failures to make things right for Indigenous children: After the government received an urgent request for suicide prevention funding from Wapekeka First Nation, they said it was an “awkward time” to fund it. After several deaths by suicide in the community, the Tribunal connected it directly to the government’s refusal to comply.
They spent $110,000 to deny dental coverage for a child who needed a $6,000 procedure – only to lose in court.
Their bills to reform the child welfare system and fund Indigenous language education were blasted by experts for not including any funding to improve services. Instead of backing up his words with action, Justin Trudeau fought Indigenous children in court while handing billions in giveaways to corporations and the wealthiest Canadians. ",2019-10-04

Trudeau Propped Up Harper and Backed Billions in Corporate Tax Cuts Lately, Justin Trudeau has been working overtime to convince Canadians he was part of a “progressive opposition” to Stephen Harper. But Trudeau’s record at the time shows he was not so progressive and he didn’t do all that much opposing. In 2009, the Liberals had an opportunity to join with Jack Layton to defeat Stephen Harper’s budget and block billions in corporate giveaways. Trudeau and the Liberals voted for that budget instead, locking in Harper’s corporate tax cut plan from 19.5% in 2008 to 15% in 2012. That cut gave away $55 billion over five years. When Trudeau came to power in 2015, he kept those tax breaks in place. And Just last year he piled on another $14 billion in giveaways. Between 2006 and 2009, the “progressive” Liberals propped up Harper in 79 confidence motions while Jack Layton and the NDP consistently tried to defeat Harper. So while Justin Trudeau claims he “couldn’t” stop Stephen Harper in opposition, perhaps a more honest word is “wouldn’t.” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Again and again, Justin Trudeau has chosen the rich and powerful over people. He gives Canadians pretty words at election time, and then stands up for multimillionaires when he’s behind closed doors. We’ll ensure corporations and the super-rich pay their share so we can make life better and more affordable for everyday Canadians.” ",2019-10-16

Liberals Attack Independent Parliamentary Budget Office for Criticizing their Housing Plan In June, the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer said that the Liberal housing plan “largely maintains current funding levels for current activities and slightly reduces targeted funding for households in core housing need… It is not clear that National Housing Strategy will reduce the prevalence of housing need relative to 2017 levels.” (Toronto Star) In fact, the report shows that Trudeau’s spending on affordable housing is 19% less than under Harper’s plan as a percentage of GDP. (PBO, Page 4) Now Adam Vaughan, Justin Trudeau's housing lead, is attacking the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer. But it’s not just the PBO that says the Liberals have fallen short. Housing experts like University of Toronto Professor David Hulchanski agree: “The Liberal Party and even CMHC have mixed all these together into big sounding amounts, as if a great deal is happening. But not much is happening in terms of meeting housing need and existing spending on housing remains at a historically low percentage of the federal budget.” And earlier this year, Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan admitted they “double counted to rhetorical advantage.” Canadian Rental Housing index numbers released yesterday show that in Adam Vaughan's own riding of Spadina Fort York, a median income renter is spending 56% of their paycheck on rent for a 2 bedroom apartment, leaving little behind for necessities like groceries, health care or child care. NDP Candidate Diana Yoon: ""Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan say they will be there for Canadians, but turn around and give tax breaks to their rich friends instead of investing in the housing people need. Now, they’re attacking independent officials to try to cover it up. Jagmeet Singh's New Deal for People would build 500,000 new housing units to make life more affordable for all renters.” ",2019-09-18

Grassy Narrows is a visible reminder of the federal government’s neglect of the people of northwestern Ontario.  From Indigenous justice to jobs and housing, Liberals and Conservatives have failed to work for the region. “Grassy Narrows isn’t the only matter the federal government failed to address – so is the 25-year-long drinking water advisory in Neskantaga, the lack of services people rely on, the homelessness and the drug epidemic in Kenora,” said Turtle. “Our communities deserve better.” Neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives have worked to make things right for Grassy Narrows, a community affected by mercury poisoning since the 1960s - but they haven’t delivered either for northwestern Ontario on jobs, housing and making life more affordable for families. “I see people who struggle every day to make ends meet,” added Turtle. “The Liberals’ priority is to represent the big corporate interests they work for, instead of everyday Canadians. We have a new deal for people in northwestern Ontario that finally puts them first,” added Turtle. “Unlike the Liberals and Conservatives who work for the rich and well-connected, we’re in it for you.” The NDP is committed to make things right for Grassy Narrows and to make life better for people in northwestern Ontario.

Singh Lays Out Priorities For Canadians Pharmacare and dental care, affordable homes, student debt, climate, cell phone bills and super-wealth tax
		OTTAWA – With momentum on Jagmeet Singh’s side, the NDP Leader laid out urgent priorities he said the government must take on to help Canadians and vowed to fight for these priorities regardless of the outcome of the election. “People will try to scare Canadians into voting for less out of fear and settling for less. Fear has never changed a thing. But hope has,” said Singh. “I’m running to be Prime Minister. But whether I am Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition or holding the balance of power, this is what the NDP will ensure the next government delivers for people.” Highlighting reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples — from clean water to equity in services — as a foundation for all government actions, Singh shared his priorities. A national universal pharmacare plan and a national dental care plan, delivering affordability and better health to Canadians.
A home people can afford, including massive investments in housing, real action on money laundering and a tax on foreign speculators.
Beginning to tackle student debt, by taking all interest off of student loans, current and future.
A bold plan and concrete action to fight the climate crisis, ending the subsidies to big oil companies, committing to science-based targets and helping workers during the transition from fossil fuels.
Making cell phone and internet bills more affordable by putting in place a price cap to make sure that Canadians aren’t paying more than the global average for their cell phone and internet bills.
Ensuring the super-wealthy are paying their fair share by introducing a super wealth tax, closing tax loopholes, and ending giveaways for the richest companies and individuals. “We can and must change the way Canadians choose their government, so that people feel they can vote for what they believe, not against what they fear,” said Singh. “We can change the system so that every vote counts no matter where you live. And so that Liberals or Conservatives can never ignore you again. We can ensure that the next government changes the system, so it works for you by delivering real electoral reform, proportional representation, to stop the revolving door of bad and worse.” While Singh works towards an NDP victory on Oct. 21, should voters choose a minority government, he has completely ruled out propping up an Andrew Scheer Conservative government.

Trudeau’s Refusal to Act Leads to Closure of Sole Abortion Clinic in Fredericton As Justin Trudeau campaigns on abortion, his refusal to enforce the Canada Health Act has led directly to the closure of New Brunswick’s only freestanding abortion clinic. Clinic 554 announced today that it is closing because of New Brunswick’s refusal to cover the cost of surgical abortion services outside of hospitals - a clear violation of the Canada Health Act. Justin Trudeau has ignored widespread calls to stand up for abortion services in New Brunswick. In Atlantic Canada access to abortions is limited and expensive, forcing some people to travel up to 500 kilometres to access surgical abortion. The essential health care services Clinic 554 include abortions, as well as specialized care for trans people, HIV-positive people, and those dealing with substance use. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau is campaigning on the right to choose, but his refusal to act has actually reduced access to abortion.

NDP Calls for Canada to Take Legal Action Against Opioid Manufacturers Trudeau refuses to take on pharmaceutical companies after meeting with them 875 times BURNABY — Johnson & Johnson, the American pharmaceutical giant, has been ordered to pay US$572 million for fueling the opioid crisis south of the border. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP Health Critic Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway) are calling on the Trudeau government to join the Government of British Columbia to take civil legal action on behalf of Canadians - and investigate whether criminal charges are warranted. ""Each and every day for the last two years, 10 Canadian families lost a loved one because of the opioid crisis,"" said Singh. ""Drug companies played a role in the American opioid crisis, and they may be legally responsible for the devastation opioids caused in Canada, too. Justin Trudeau's Liberals need to stop protecting big pharma at the expense of people and communities."" Trudeau's Liberals have refused to join British Columbia's legal action to seek compensation from drug companies for the costs of addressing the opioid crisis. To date, Trudeau and the Liberals have taken no steps to investigate the role that drug companies may have played in fueling the opioid crisis. Since the last election, the Liberals have received more than $32,000 in donations from people at pharmaceutical and insurance corporations, and have met with their lobbyists at least 875 times. ""Families have been torn apart, and lives have been devastated. With the Johnson & Johnson decision, grieving parents in Canada are left to wonder if opioid manufacturers also marketed these products to Canadians and Canadian doctors in a way that skirted federal law,"" added Davies. ''It's time to launch civil action, and a federal investigation to determine whether criminal charges are warranted against opioid manufacturers and distributors for their alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis. Families who lost a loved one to this crisis deserve answers."" Jagmeet Singh and the NDP have vowed, if elected, to immediately declare a public health emergency and launch an investigation into the role drug companies may have played in fueling the opioid crisis, seeking meaningful financial compensation for the costs of this crisis. The NDP is also committed to supporting overdose prevention sites and expanding access to addictions treatment. Facts: Last summer, the NDP government of British Columbia filed a civil lawsuit against drug companies to recoup the enormous costs incurred by that province in addressing the crisis. This year, the government of Ontario announced they would join B.C.'s lawsuit.
In addition to Monday's ruling, the United States Department of Justice has already secured criminal pleas and, along with dozens of states, over $600 million in damages from opioid manufacturers for misbranding offences in that country.
From 2011 to 2016 alone, provincial drug plans across Canada spent $548.6 million on medications to treat addictions to prescription and illicit opioids. Hundreds of millions of dollars more were spent by governments for emergency room visits, first responders and treatment programs. ",2019-08-27

Singh to Trudeau: Why Are You Letting Multimillionaires Off the Hook? Yesterday, Jagmeet Singh challenged Justin Trudeau on why he won't tax the super-rich to pay for services Canadians badly need. Trudeau used to talk about making the rich pay their share. But after four years in power, Canada’s richest 87 families hold as much wealth as 12 million Canadians. Trudeau's 2019 platform includes nothing that asks the richest 1% to pay more, and offers nothing to Canadians who can't afford basic needs like rent and medication. Does Justin Trudeau think that’s fair? Singh said: “We know that Mr. Trudeau is not willing to tax the richest Canadians. We put it to him, and people have asked him, would he be willing to put in place our wealth tax on the super wealthy? He hasn’t said yes.” “No other party is willing to say we’re going to make sure that the richest Canadians, those who have fortunes of over $20 million, pay their fair share. Everyone else, Canadians, hardworking families, middle-class families, they’re paying their fair share. They don’t need to pay any more of the burden. “We’re not going to raise taxes on middle-class and working-class families. But we’re asking the richest to pay their fair share. Mr. Trudeau is not willing to do that.” Singh has made implementing a super-wealth tax on fortunes over $20 million an urgent priority in the next Parliament. The PBO estimates it will raise $5.6 billion in its first year to spend on priorities like pharmacare, housing, and dental care. Video of Singh’s comments is available here. ",2019-10-16

Justin Trudeau likes to talk about taxing the rich. Back in 2015, he told the Canadian Club: ""I know people in your position get asked for a lot, and as evidenced by the thriving and generous philanthropic culture in Canada, you step up. Your contributions to Canadian society have been appreciated — and I'm asking for one more."" (CBC, May 11, 2015) But here’s what he actually did: Trudeau’s so-called middle-class tax cut actually meant two-thirds of Canadians got $0 – while the 1% got a $675 tax cut.
He recently handed $14 billion in giveaways to big corporations.
A $12 million giveaway to Loblaws, one of Canada’s largest companies.
Let wealthy KPMG clients off the hook for a $130 million offshore tax avoidance scheme.
Protected stock option loopholes for CEOs, costing Canadians $700 million a year.

Jagmeet Singh: Jack Harris is on Your Side in St. John’s East ST. JOHN’S – New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh joined NDP candidate Jack Harris in St. John’s on Tuesday to discuss their bold plan to make everyday life more affordable and services more available for people in Newfoundland and Labrador. “People in St. John’s are worried about the rising cost of living. The Trudeau Liberals have spent years focused on helping out their rich corporate friends, making it harder and harder for regular people to get ahead,” said Singh. “That’s why I’m so proud to have great candidates like Jack Harris standing up for Newfoundland and Labrador in Ottawa. Jack has a proven record of fighting for families, for the health care they need, the jobs and opportunity they deserve, and the affordability to help them get ahead.” Singh is in St. John’s sharing his New Deal for People – a bold plan to make life more affordable all while addressing issues like climate change, expanding quality health care services, and working for meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous communities. The NDP’s New Deal offers 300,000 new jobs across Canada, expands and improves Employment Insurance, and creates a national pharmacare program to cover all Canadians — the first step in the plan to cover dental care and vision care. The New Deal pays for the improvements by having those who have more than $20 million in wealth pay a little more, along with closing tax loopholes for the super-wealthy and mega-corporations. Singh was joined by Harris, NDP candidate for St. John’s East and MP from 2008 to 2015, and former leader of the provincial NDP. “I know that many people are worrying about making ends meet in St. John’s East and want strong representation in Ottawa. With the NDP, we have a plan that stands up for everyday people – investing in health care and child care – and making sure everyone can afford to build a good life,” said Harris. “That’s why I’m more motivated than ever to bring this fight to Ottawa.” ",2019-09-03

NDP Pledges Housing Help for Canadians NDP’s New Deal for People would create 500,000 affordable homes TORONTO – The day after his rally in Toronto to a packed theatre of 800 supporters, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh continued to discuss how his New Deal for People will make life more affordable for Canadians who are increasingly feeling the squeeze of skyrocketing costs for necessities like housing. “No Canadian should have to choose between paying their rent and putting food on the table, but this impossible decision is all too real for too many families from coast to coast to coast,” said Singh. “And in places like Toronto, young people are struggling to find an affordable place to live as rents soar and reno-victions push people out of neighbourhoods they’ve lived in for years.” Singh was joined by Andrew Cash, the NDP candidate for Davenport, for a roundtable Monday with residents who are having a hard time staying afloat in Toronto. Miranda, for example, was forced to leave her home of fifteen years after her landlord ended her tenancy. This meant she and her daughter had to live apart from her partner temporarily and their family eventually had to pay more for less space. “The Conservatives and Liberals have had years to fix Canada’s housing crisis, and they’ve failed. Justin Trudeau’s pretty words ring hollow for the many families struggling to keep a roof over their heads,"" added Singh. “It’s time that people like Miranda had someone in their corner, fighting to tackle Canada’s housing crisis so families don’t have to scrape by to make ends meet. I’m ready to make different choices to deliver the help people need.” The NDP’s New Deal for People would create half a million quality affordable homes and take action to end the speculation that’s pricing people out of communities across the country.

After Four Years of Trudeau Failures, NDP Offers New Deal For Young People Jagmeet will help young people facing unstable work have healthier, more affordable lives TORONTO – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has a plan to help young people make ends meet by giving them universal drug coverage, dental coverage, access to affordable housing, relief from student debt and a real plan to fight the climate crisis. Jagmeet’s plan will save young people $1,200 a year on cell phone fees, student debt, dentacare and pharmacare, and up to $5,000 a year on rent. “In 2015, Justin Trudeau made a lot of big promises. But four years later, the wealthiest in Canada are doing better, but things aren’t any easier for young people starting out,” said Singh. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can make different choices to get better results for young people.” Access to education should never depend on how much money your parents make or how much debt you can carry. Barriers to quality, affordable education have been set up by Liberal and Conservative governments – and it’s time to tear them down. New Democrats have a plan for young people to remove all interest from federal student loans – saving a graduate with an average loan approximately $3,400 over ten years. “Justin Trudeau walked away from his promises on pharmacare and electoral reform, but managed to find $14 billion in special tax breaks for his corporate friends. And this election, he’s telling young people to settle for less,” said Singh. “New Democrats are different. We’re in it for you, and we’re ready to make big changes to deliver a better future for young people in every part of Canada.” The NDP’s vision will also fight the climate crisis with a bold plan to defend our land, water and coasts, while creating good-paying jobs that young people can rely on.

One decision and four compliance orders later, and the government is still trying to run away from its responsibilities.” The tribunal ordered the government to pay compensation to First Nations children apprehended by child and family services agencies, as well as their families. “Justin Trudeau and the Conservatives have spent millions on lawyers to fight against the rights of First Nation children and their families,” said Turtle, the chief of Grassy Narrows First Nation. “The Tribunal ruled years ago that the government’s policies were discriminatory against Indigenous people and violated our human rights. Justin Trudeau should listen to the Assembly of First Nations and accept this decision.

Singh Will Tax Multimillionaires to Fund Health Care HAMILTON – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is meeting with Canadians struggling with cuts to important services they rely on and the growing cost of health care expenses. Singh is proposing a tax on those with fortunes above $20 million to make sure hardworking Canadians get the services they need like pharmacare and head-to-toe health care. “New Democrats have the courage to make different choices. Unlike the Liberals and Conservatives who work for their rich and powerful friends, we will help people who are struggling to get by,” said Singh. “Our plan is simple – we can afford to help people when we have the courage to ask the super-rich to pay a little bit more to fund the services we all rely on.” For years, Liberals and Conservatives have been helping their corporate friends and the very richest to avoid taxes and hide billions offshore every year. New Democrats will bring in a tax on the multimillionaires alongside tougher enforcement to stop tax evasion both in Canada, and off-shore. “Families shouldn’t have to worry about their future. They deserve a government that is actually on their side. Canadians deserve prescription drugs covered by Medicare, and expanded health care services to cover people head-to-toe – and we can do this when the very richest pay their fair share,” concluded Singh. – 30 – Facts: The NDP’s super-wealth tax would apply a 1% tax on fortunes above $20 million.
This will be applied annually and include real estate, luxury items and investments.
This tax will apply to only the very wealthiest one tenth of one percent of Canadian households.
Over ten years, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates that this tax will raise almost $70 billion, starting with $5.6 billion in 2020-21 and growing to $9.5 billion by 2028-29.
It will be paired with boosted enforcement against tax evasion and penalties for millionaires who try to evade paying taxes, including regular CRA audits and third-party valuation of assets.
In June 2019, the Parliamentary Budget Officer found that Canada is losing up to $25 billion in tax revenues to overseas tax evasion by multinational corporations. ",2019-09-10

Under public pressure, he eventually let her testify to the Ethics Commissioner and the Justice Committee – but his waiver only applied to selective time periods and didn’t allow her to discuss the controversial Cabinet shuffle that saw her moved from Justice to Veterans’ Affairs. And the Ethics Commissioner said his investigation hit roadblocks because Trudeau refused to waive Cabinet confidence for nine others who said they had relevant information.

Vaughan and Liberals Can’t Escape Empty Promises on Affordable Housing In June, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office found that Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan’s housing plan spends 19% less as a percentage of GDP than the Conservative plan did.

University of Toronto Professor David Hulchanski said that “the Liberal Party and even CMHC have mixed all these together into big sounding amounts, as if a great deal is happening. But not much is happening in terms of meeting housing need and existing spending on housing remains at a historically low percentage of the federal budget.” Hulchanksi has also described the housing strategy as “a public relations gimmick.” In August, Vaughan claimed a planned sale of the Queens Quay lands without affordable housing was out of government’s hands. The next week, the Liberals reversed course in the face of pressure from Jagmeet Singh and Councillor Joe Cressy. Meanwhile in Toronto, there are no neighbourhoods left where a person putting in full-time work for minimum wage can afford a modest one-bedroom apartment.

Jagmeet Singh Lays Out Economic Vision to Help Young People and Families Singh delivers message on tax fairness and wealth inequality at Canadian Club TORONTO – Jagmeet Singh delivered a message on his economic vision to a lunchtime audience in Toronto today that if New Democrats are elected, people at the top will have to pay a little more. “We are not going to shy away from speaking up for everyday people – and standing up to the wealthy and well-connected,” said Singh. “The stakes are high. If we do not change the path we are on, we are putting the very idea of Canada – that everyone should get the help they need to have an equal chance to succeed - at risk.” In his speech before the 120-year-old Canadian Club, Singh made the case that despite the economy doing well over the past four years, families – and young people in particular – are struggling to pay their bills each month. Meanwhile, two Canadian men now have as much wealth as the bottom 30% of all Canadians combined. Over the last few decades, the tax burden in Canada has fallen more and more onto families - while big corporations and super-wealthy Canadians pay less. Earlier this week, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP laid out an election commitment to bring in a 1% super-wealth tax on households with a net wealth of more than $20 million. The Parliamentary Budget Office has estimated that this measure could bring in $70 billion in new revenue. “Young people are struggling to pay sky-high bills for rent, tuition, student loans, cell phones and so much more. It’s time we fixed a system that is rigged against them,” said Singh. ""We believe middle- and low-income Canadians are paying their fair share. We will not raise taxes on everyday people. But we will ask big corporations and the super-wealthy to pay a little more so we can help young people and families."" ",2019-09-13

Jagmeet Singh Calls on PM Trudeau to Halt Trade Negotiations with Mercosur: While the Amazon rainforest burns, Trudeau negotiates a new free trade deal with Mercosur bloc, which includes Brazil.
		CALGARY – On Friday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to halt trade negotiations with the Mercosur Bloc until Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro takes action to protect the Amazon rainforest from deforestation. “Canadians expect our government to take real action to fight climate change here at home, and on the global stage,"" said Singh. “We need to see more than pretty statements from Mr. Trudeau — we need action."" There are almost 40,000 fires are burning in the Amazon, and the state of Amazonas has declared an emergency. That follows Bolsonaro calling the protected areas in the Amazon an obstacle to economic growth, and opening them up to commercial development while cutting back enforcement against illegal deforestation. “This is not a crisis for Brazil, it’s a crisis for humankind, and for our planet,” said Singh. “Canada's trade policy has to match our words. Canada shouldn’t be doing business with Bolsonaro while the Amazon burns.” The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest, often called the “lungs of the planet” since it produces about 20 per cent of the world’s oxygen.

Liberals Need to Lead on Solving Root Causes of Violence: NDP TORONTO - New Democrats are calling for real leadership and a real plan after Justin Trudeau refused to answer questions about how he would address the root causes of gun violence in Toronto. Instead of showing real leadership on serious issues Torontonians are facing, Trudeau was quick to blame Ontario Premier Doug Ford. Torontonians deserve a government that doesn't wait until a federal election campaign to talk about the issues they deal with every day - affordable housing, health care services, and safe cities. ""We know the root causes for violence in our communities - they include poverty, racial discrimination, huge gaps in mental health services, the lack of adequate and affordable housing and the lack of meaningful, good quality job opportunities for young people,"" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wrote to Trudeau in 2018. ""We must strike a new path, one that engages all communities in a united effort to tackle gun violence at its roots. We must replace simplistic solutions with comprehensive, well-informed strategies built out of partnership with those most affected."" In a press conference with the Prime Minister, Toronto Mayor John Tory drew attention to the lack of federal investment in kids, families, and neighbourhoods and explained how with the lack of federal resources, Toronto needs to do more to address violence over the long term. ""Mayor Tory is right to call attention to the lack of leadership from the federal government,"" said the NDP candidate for Davenport, Andrew Cash. ""I have been listening to people in Davenport and, yes, they worry about gun violence but they also worry about affordable housing, the cost of prescription drugs, and good quality jobs. It's not good enough for the Prime Minister to show up right before an election with no meaningful solutions after four years of inaction. New Democrats will back up talk with action by investing in things like health care, affordable housing, and childcare. We can tackle the things that are keeping people up at night worrying - and make sure everyone can afford a good life."" ",2019-08-14

5 times Justin Trudeau Tried to Cover his Tracks on the SNC-Lavalin Scandal Justin Trudeau has been found guilty twice of breaking Canada’s conflict of interest law – the first time for accepting an all-expenses-paid Caribbean vacation from a billionaire, and the second time for trying to get SNC-Lavalin off the hook for serious corporate corruption criminal charges. Here are 5 times Justin Trudeau tried cover his tracks: 
Blocking testimony at the Justice Committee. After the NDP called for an investigation at the Justice Committee into Justin Trudeau’s alleged political interference in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, the Liberals voted against a motion to investigate. They voted instead for their own, weaker motion – but they couldn’t stop former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould’s explosive testimony. After that, they shut the investigation down.
 
The NDP’s call for a Public Inquiry. After the Liberals axed the Justice Committee, the NDP called for a vote on a public inquiry in the House of Commons. In a close vote that saw some Liberals break ranks, they voted it down.
 
Blocking the Ethics Commissioner’s investigation. While the Ethics Commissioner was investigating (at the request of the NDP), the Liberals refused to give documents and critical testimony protected by refusing to waive Cabinet confidentiality. The Commissioner noted in his final report that he felt his investigation was blocked.
 
Blocking the Ethics Commissioner’s public testimony. After the Commissioner released his stinging report, NDP MPs pushed to hear directly from him at the Ethics Committee. With the Commissioner ready to appear, the Liberals shut down the meeting instead of hearing directly from him about his explosive finding of guilt.
 
Refusing to waive confidentiality for the RCMP. Hours before this election campaign began, we learned that the RCMP had interviewed the Liberals in connection with the SNC-Lavalin scandal – but were barred by Cabinet confidence from getting certain critical information.

NDP to Announce Plan to Tackle Rising Racism and Islamophobia in Canada TORONTO – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will speak at the National Canadian Council of Muslims Townhall, and announce his plan to replace Liberal rhetoric with real action to address racism in Canada. “Absolutely no one should be made to feel like they don’t belong, or that they’re not safe – not online, not at school or work, and not in their communities. Too often, though, racialized Canadians still experience discrimination. I’m committed to standing up for people by confronting online hate and Islamophobia,”said Singh. “The Liberals have missed opportunity after opportunity to make Canada more inclusive. Pretty speeches about diversity are no replacement for concrete action.” Singh will announce NDP commitments to tackle racism, including Islamophobia, with action. They include: Making social media platforms responsible for removing hateful and extremist content.
Boosting enforcement against hate crimes with dedicated hate crimes units.
Passing a federal law to ban carding. “The Liberals have left social media giants to voluntarily develop policies around hateful and extremist content, and that’s not working,” said Singh. “It’s time to take on the web giants so we can better protect Canadians — that’s who I’m in it for.” Singh will also address employment discrimination and other topics, and participate in a panel discussion. “White supremacy and any group that spreads supremacist views have no place in Canada,” added Singh. “As political leaders, we have to not only pay lip service to diversity and inclusion — we have to be vigilant to stamp out racism.” The NDP’s New Deal for People proposes several measures to take meaningful action on racism and Islamophobia. – 30 – What people are saying: “We are at a critical point in time. Police reported hate crimes have increased exponentially and over 40% of those reported crimes are motivated by hate of race or ethnicity. Victims of these hate crimes are every day people who deserve to live in safety and with dignity. The growing threat of far-right extremism in Canada is a real risk to not only our democracy, but our national security. Yet, this issue is largely excluded from the public agenda. I am pleased to see Jagmeet Singh and his team prioritize this important issue in their vision for a better Canada.”

 “Over the last few years, I have become increasingly disheartened by the fact that I am living in a Canada I no longer recognize. The disturbing rise of anti-Black racism, anti-Indigenous racism, Islamophobia, and anti-Semitism, while always a reality within our institutions, seems to have intensified in the public sphere in recent years. The NDP vision document on Confronting Racism gives me hope that we will see a government that is finally ready to admit that we too have a “race problem” and that is committed to addressing it in its many forms – overt and direct and systemic and structural. I want to be able to recognize my Canada again – a Canada that, while not perfect, is determined to get back on track with upholding its core values of equity and justice. As a university professor who works with Black, Indigenous, immigrant and other racially diverse communities, I share the NDP’s stated commitment to ensuring that every Canadian is valued and respected, regardless of their race, culture and ethnic background and that every social institution is equipped and ready to identify, name, and address structurally-embedded forms of racism that harm the social, economic, and political well-being of racialized communities. As I continue to work with communities to address long-standing forms of racism and other inequalities, I will hold the NDP accountable to the vision outlined in their vision document.”

Singh Promises Immediate Relief for Students OTTAWA – Jagmeet Singh and the New Democrats have announced a plan to cancel the interest on all existing and future student loans. “Young people, just starting out, deserve a shot to get ahead and build their best life. We need to make sure that cost is never a barrier to education, and we can give those who recently left school relief from the struggle to make ends meet,” said Singh. “It’s wrong for the government to be profiting off the backs of students and grads. That’s why I will eliminate all interest on federal student loans — both outstanding loans, and going forward.” Over the last four years, Trudeau’s Liberals have taken almost $3 billion from graduates in interest payments – profiting from skyrocketing student debt. “Young people deserve to graduate with hope for a better future, not a crushing debt load,” said Singh. “They shouldn’t have to live with their parents because of student debt. They shouldn’t be trapped working hard and not getting by. And they shouldn’t have to put off starting their own family because of student debt. But that’s what’s happening now. “Eliminating the interest on student loans is a simple first step to make it easier to build a good life, and I’m looking forward to talking about more of our plans in the weeks to come.” Singh was joined by Andrew Cash, NDP candidate for Davenport, at a roundtable with young people to discuss the challenges faced by new graduates.

 Facts: The NDP’s plan would immediately drop the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to 0%. This would apply to outstanding loans as well as new ones.
Under the NDP’s plan, a graduate with a debt of $13,500 (average federal student debt) will save $3,400 over the lifetime of the loan.
A graduate with a debt of $20,000 will save $5,000.
The NDP’s New Deal for People also commits to moving from student loans to non-repayable grants, and to a future where post-secondary education is fully part of the public education system so kids can go from kindergarten to a career, without the barrier of cost. ",2019-09-05

Study Shows How Trudeau’s Abandoned Pharmacare Promise Will Hurt People A study done by the St. Michael’s Hospital’s MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions shows that providing universal pharmacare will make life significantly more affordable for people. It found that covering the cost of prescription drugs causes a large increase – from 33% to 86% – in people’s ability to ""make ends meet"" or afford basic necessities such as food and rent, showing that for many people, medicine costs are the difference between paying the bills or not. Meanwhile, experts agree that Justin Trudeau has abandoned his pharmacare promise. Former Liberal Health Minister Jane Philpott says it falls “far short” of what is required. It’s been 22 years since the Liberals first rolled out their pharmacare promise. And this campaign, just six days after telling Canadians he would bring in pharmacare, Justin Trudeau completely abandoned Canadians struggling with the cost of prescription drugs. The lead scientists criticized the Liberals, pointing out that if they had made any progress on pharmacare in the last four years, they wouldn’t have been able to find people to participate in their study. NDP candidate Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway):
		“Across Canada, people are having to make impossible choices every day – cutting pills in half, choosing between paying rent or filling their prescription, or going without the drugs they need altogether. It doesn’t have to be this way. Trudeau’s Liberals could have chosen to stand up for Canadians and bring in drug coverage, but they listened to lobbyists and chose not to act. New Democrats will do the right thing and invest in your health by immediately bringing in a universal, comprehensive pharmacare program.” ",2019-10-07

On banning scabs: In 2010, Justin Trudeau voted in favour of anti-scab legislation while in opposition.[8] In 2016, the Trudeau Liberals voted down NDP legislation that would ban the use of replacement workers.[9] According to an issue paper from Employment and Social Development Canada, an increase in the federal minimum wage “has been found to increase job stability”, would “reduce the gender wage gap” and would even benefit other workers making above the minimum wage.[10] “Justin Trudeau says what workers want to hear in public, then bends over backwards to make life easier for his corporate friends – that’s on his record,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “New Democrats know whose side we’re on.

Singh is proposing a tax on those with fortunes above $20 million to make sure hardworking Canadians get the services they need like pharmacare and head-to-toe health care. “New Democrats have the courage to make different choices. Unlike the Liberals and Conservatives who work for their rich and powerful friends, we will help people who are struggling to get by,” said Singh. “Our plan is simple – we can afford to help people when we have the courage to ask the super-rich to pay a little bit more to fund the services we all rely on.” For years, Liberals and Conservatives have been helping their corporate friends and the very richest to avoid taxes and hide billions offshore every year. New Democrats will bring in a tax on the multimillionaires alongside tougher enforcement to stop tax evasion both in Canada, and off-shore. “Families shouldn’t have to worry about their future. They deserve a government that is actually on their side. Canadians deserve prescription drugs covered by Medicare, and expanded health care services to cover people head-to-toe – and we can do this when the very richest pay their fair share,” concluded Singh. – 30 – Facts: The NDP’s super-wealth tax would apply a 1% tax on fortunes above $20 million.

Parents in British Columbia have called the provincial NDP government’s $10 a day child care pilot program ‘life changing’. Our commitment will build on this success.

As Trudeau Campaigns on Abortion, Millions of Canadians Still Face Barriers Accessing It While Justin Trudeau styles himself a defender of abortion rights, his record tells a very different story. People in rural communities across Canada are often forced to travel hundreds of kilometers to access an abortion, while some provinces continue to openly obstruct access. In New Brunswick, abortion services are only covered if performed in a hospital.  Those seeking abortions from private clinics pay up to $850 out of pocket. Many communities have no abortion clinic nearby. In Nova Scotia, barriers to access can sometimes mean travelling over 500 km to a hospital that will provide the procedure. In PEI, abortions only became available in 2016, and there is still only one clinic that provides them. Earlier this year, the Leader of the PEI Liberals attended an anti-choice rally. But the Liberals have refused to impose real consequences if provinces make it hard to access abortion. New Democrats will make sure that abortion services are safe and accessible no matter where you live by enforcing the Canada Health Act, and stepping in to fund abortion services when provinces refuse to do so.

NDP Promises Families Relief on Cell Phone and Internet Bills NDP’s plan to cap prices would save Canadian families almost $250 per year TORONTO –  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in Toronto today to announce his plan to protect Canadians from gouging by big telecom companies. Singh is calling for a cap on cell phone and internet prices, which would save families almost $250 a year. “For most Canadians, having a cell phone and high-speed Internet is not a choice — they need these things for school, for work, and to stay connected with family and friends,” said Singh. “And Canadians who are fortunate to have access to reliable service pay some of the highest prices in the developed world. They can’t afford to give these things up, even as rising costs squeeze their budgets.” Liberal and Conservative governments have left Canadians to go at it alone as telecom companies gouge them all while raking in billions of dollars. On Trudeau’s watch, the Big Five telecoms enjoyed profit margins of almost 40 per cent in 2017. To top it off, Trudeau rewarded Bell, Rogers and Telus with $50 million in subsidies and more than $700 million in contracts. “Canadians deserve better than Liberal and Conservative governments that keep making life easier for their corporate friends and harder for everyone else,” said Singh. “I’m ready to fight for everyday people and stand up to rich telecom companies. Our plan to cap prices on cell phone and internet bills is part of our commitment to make life more affordable.” The New Deal for People would also introduce a Telecom Consumers’ Bill of Rights to put an end to the aggressive and misleading sales and services practices of big cell and internet companies. The NDP will require service providers to offer basic plans that meet the needs of Canadians, end caps for internet plans and require companies to offer affordable, unlimited data plans for cellphones – so Canadians don’t have any surprise on their monthly bills. Facts: Among OECD countries and other developed economies, Canadians pay some of the highest prices for mobile wireless and broadband subscriptions.
Similar countries like Australia are sometimes paying 2 times less than Canada for the same plan.
In 2018, the total revenue per gigabyte in Canada was roughly 70 times higher than in India and 23 times higher than in Finland.
Canadian telecoms made 35 times what Indian companies made for the same data usage in 2017. As a result, Canada has lower data use than many other countries.

NDP Statement on Liberals’ Failure to Better Protect Children Against Abuse in Sports NDP Sports Critic and candidate Cheryl Hardcastle (Windsor Tecumseh) issued the following release: ""Six months have passed since a CBC investigation revealed the widespread instances of sexual abuse and harassment by coaches in amateur sports in Canada. Although Trudeau’s Liberals pledged to address this serious problem, they failed to follow through on any of their commitments. The Minister of Sport, Kirsty Duncan, claimed last month that her department had rolled out a series of initiatives, but to date her government has only allocated $69 000 for unspecified ‘’safe sport initiatives’’. The Liberals are not taking this problem seriously. This is about the safety of children. We still don’t have an independent investigative unit responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-harassment policy and for complaints of abuse and harassment in sport. The Liberals have also failed to inform organizations representing Canada’s largest participatory sports about the existence of a tip line for athletes and witnesses to call if they experience abuse. Our young athletes deserve better. It is time for this Liberal government to stop pretending that it has taken action on this file, when it clearly has not."" ",2019-09-05

NDP Statement on the anniversary of 9/11 and National Day of Service Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement: In the hours and days following the September 11 attacks, people all over Canada stepped up in response to that horrible event, volunteering their time and services, with kindness and compassion. As communities, businesses, social services, first responders, and volunteer agencies joined hands to help our American friends, we showed our true Canadian character and our spirit of unity and generosity. On this National Day of Service, and the 18th anniversary of that tragic day, New Democrats join all Canadians in honouring all those who were killed by this terrorist act – including the 26 Canadians who lost their lives – and pay tribute to those who were injured and whose lives were forever changed. On this day, we also pay tribute to the outpouring of Canadian support and the selfless service of all those who continue to stand up in the face of terrorism. Spontaneous acts of courage and generosity remind us of the best humanity has to offer and inspire us to show the same kind of compassion to those in need around us – by engaging in local charitable activities, volunteering in our communities, and helping our friends and neighbours. On a day intended to turn an infamous date into a day of hope, let’s commit ourselves to continue building a world where everyone can feel safe and valued, and ensure that such terrible events never happen again.

NDP’s New Deal For B.C. Highlights Affordable Homes, Climate Action Jagmeet Singh takes on money launderers and housing speculation VANCOUVER—More affordable homes and a real plan to fight the climate crisis are at the heart of a New Deal for B.C. unveiled today by NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “When B.C. families asked for help with the out-of-control housing market, Justin Trudeau spent $4.5 billion of their money on a pipeline instead,” said Singh. “Liberals and Conservatives have failed people here for too long. British Columbians deserve a real partner in Ottawa: a New Democrat government that has the courage to do what’s right to make sure that everyone has an affordable place to call home.” While the B.C. government has done the hard work to tackle the housing crisis, Trudeau has failed to do enough on the money laundering and speculation that’s driving up real estate prices. The NDP’s urgent action plan includes a dedicated RCMP unit to fight money laundering and a national registry that prevents companies from hiding who profits from real estate, along with a tax on foreign buyers to address housing speculation. “New Democrats understand the priorities of British Columbians, and we will fight for them,” said Singh. “Working families have paid the price long enough for the pretty words and empty promises. We’ll take real action to make housing more affordable, because we’re in it for you.” The NDP’s plan to make life more affordable for B.C. families includes bringing down the cost of cell phone bills, and bringing in dental care and universal prescription drug coverage. New Democrats will also fight the climate crisis with a bold plan to defend our land, water and coasts, while creating good-paying jobs that families can rely on. – 30 – Facts: In April 2019, B.C.’s expert panel reported that money laundering funded $5.3 billion in real estate purchases and was responsible for increasing housing prices by 5% across the province. [1]
The report found that B.C. didn’t have a single federal RCMP officer dedicated to investigating money laundering.
Currently, it would take the average young person 29 years to save enough money for a down payment on a home in Vancouver. [2]
The NDP’s plan will immediately create a dedicated RCMP anti-money laundering unit – with B.C. as a priority. We will invest $20 million in additional funding each year, half of which will go to B.C., to ensure that dedicated officers work on money laundering.
Building on the leadership of the B.C. government, we would require corporations, trusts and partnerships that currently own or buy land to disclose who owns them by creating a national beneficial ownership registry. Tax authorities, police, and regulators would be able to use the information to crack down on tax evasion, fraud, and money laundering.
We will also bring in a national foreign buyer’s tax to curb speculation that’s fueling high housing prices. The 15% Foreign Buyer’s Tax will apply on the sale of homes to individuals who aren’t Canadian citizens or permanent residents, on top of existing provincial taxes. This will raise an estimated $320 million in the first full year of implementation. ",2019-09-25

Justin Trudeau’s Tax Avoidance Hypocrisy This morning, Justin Trudeau attacked Andrew Scheer for planning a tax break for people who use numbered companies to protect their income. Trudeau said Scheer is “planning to give a tax break, larger than the average person makes in a year, for people who are using private corporations to hide, to protect their income.” Meanwhile, he’s refusing to crack down on multimillionaires using offshore tax havens to avoid Canadian taxes. In June, the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that Canada was losing up to $25 billion in revenue every year because corporations were doing business in Canada then transferring money to known tax havens to be taxed at a lower rate. $25 billion represents $675 in lost revenue for every Canadian. Two years ago, the Paradise Papers revealed that Justin Trudeau’s close friend and chief fundraiser Stephen Bronfman was linked to a $60 million offshore trust in the Cayman Islands which may have cost Canada millions in lost revenue. Former Liberal Prime Ministers Jean Chretien and Paul Martin were also linked to offshore tax havens. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “If Justin Trudeau meant a word he said, he’d be taking action to crack down on tax havens. Instead, he’s chosen to protect wealthy Liberal insiders and make Canadians pay the price. It’s time for real action to ensure multimillionaires pay their share so we can invest in services like pharmacare and dentacare to make life better for Canadians.” ",2019-10-06
