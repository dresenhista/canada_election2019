""I'm ready to take the spirit at the heart of my work in film to a different stage. I'm excited to keep working for the movement I belong to with the NDP on the federal political scene,"" said the man who made a name for himself with the hit TV show La course destination monde. “I will be a voice for 600,000 workers in Canada's cultural sector, which makes up 4% of our economy. I'm also excited to join Jagmeet, Alexandre and the entire NDP team of candidates to speed up the transition of our economy to a 21st century model.” NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was visibly pleased to have such a star candidate in Montmagny-L'Islet-Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. “Hugo is a passionate and honest man who has excelled in all areas of his professional life, while remaining true to his values and principles,"" he said. “I'm thrilled to have him on our team.

Families Can’t Go Four More Years Without Drug and Dental Care NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says charging for medicine means families ‘pay up or get sick’ SASKATOON – Decades of Conservative and Liberal governments siding with big pharma, instead of with everyday Canadians, means families are forced to pay up, or get sick — and families can’t go four more years without drug and dental coverage, said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Because of Justin Trudeau’s choices, there are Canadians who sit at the kitchen table and cut their pills in half to make the bottle last longer,” said Singh. “There are moms and dads who have to make the heartbreaking decision to put off getting their kid’s cavity filled because money’s tight. Families can’t go four more years without the medicine they need. They can’t go four more years without getting their teeth checked.” Rather than expanding health care, the Conservatives would cut and squeeze health care even more. Justin Trudeau promised to help the middle class but did nothing to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, housing or other costs — and, as a result, families are falling further behind. Singh said it’s no surprise Trudeau won’t implement a universal pharmacare plan, since the record shows the Trudeau government has met behind closed doors with pharmaceutical and insurance companies more than 850 times. “No wonder the Liberals have blocked pharmacare and dental coverage. They’re not working for you, and I want people to know that you don’t have to settle for that. No one should have to spend four more years being forced to choose between paying up, or letting their family get sick,” said Singh. “People need a New Deal. Not Conservative cuts that would cost families more and force more folks to end up in jam-packed hospitals. Not a plan to keep protecting the profits of big pharma. A plan to make life affordable and healthy for you and your kids.” Singh’s platform commits to introducing a national universal pharmacare plan by the end of 2020, saving each family more than $500 a year, even if they already have insurance; and a dental plan to provide coverage for millions of families. The NDP’s platform includes a one per cent tax on wealth over $20 million, raising $70 billion over 10 years — funding better, expanded health care. ",2019-10-04

NDP Plan Helps Prevent Gang Crime Jagmeet Singh takes action for people where Justin Trudeau has failed SURREY – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh unveiled his plan today to tackle rising organized crime in B.C. and keep our kids out of gangs, taking action where Liberals have refused to act. “People in Surrey are worried about the future for their kids, but instead of listening, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals chose to spend $4.5 billion of your money on a pipeline while leaving British Columbians to tackle crime alone,” said Singh. “New Democrats have the courage to take a different approach. It’s time to look out for kids and protect our communities from the rising gang violence and organized crime that’s hurting everyday families in B.C.” An NDP government will create a $100 million fund dedicated to helping keep young people out of gangs, with a boost to programs that get youth involved in their community. New Democrats will also immediately create a dedicated RCMP anti-money laundering unit and put an end to hidden corporate ownership of real estate, to help crack down on tax evasion and fraud. “Young people who’ve been left behind need someone on their side. Preventing gang activity and tackling the housing crisis – those are the priorities of families here in Surrey and they need a government in Ottawa that takes them seriously,” said Singh. “We’re replacing empty talk with concrete action, because New Democrats are in it for you.” The NDP’s New Deal for People also gets results for B.C. families by investing in more affordable housing and fighting the climate crisis. New Democrats will safeguard the coast from the increased risk of oil spills, as a result of the high tanker traffic permitted by the Liberals, which would only be worsened by Big Oil-backed Conservatives and the Green Party that won’t rule out supporting them.

Jagmeet Singh Makes Commitments to Fight Climate Change TROIS-RIVIÈRES – New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP MPs Ruth Ellen Brosseau (Berthier-Maskinongé) and Robert Aubin (Trois-Rivières) have committed to moving forward with the high frequency rail project and have promised major investments to help municipalities that were once again impacted by flooding. “Climate change threatens life as we know it. While Justin Trudeau and the Liberals promote their pipeline project, my team and I are presenting a concrete plan to fight climate change with Power to Change: A New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs,” said Singh. “Today, I reiterate my commitment about the high-frequency train project to the people of Trois-Rivières. I want to see a ground-breaking ceremony during the first year of our mandate! We’re also committed to major investments to help flood victims so that our infrastructure can be adapted to this new climate reality.” As proposed by VIA Rail, the high frequency train project will connect Jean Lesage Airport in Quebec City to Toronto, via Trois-Rivières, Montreal, Ottawa, Smith Falls, and Peterborough. It includes a dedicated lane for passenger transport. A high frequency train will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, stimulate regional economic activities, and create numerous quality jobs. In contrast with the Liberal approach, all funding for the NDP project will be public. ""It’s time to invest in projects that fight climate change, not in pipelines that threaten our environment,"" added Aubin. “Justin Trudeau's Liberals talk out of both sides of their mouths when it comes to the environment. As for the Conservatives, they don’t even mention public transit in their climate plan. That’s ridiculous! The NDP is committed to setting up a meeting between VIA Rail, the provinces involved, and key municipal stakeholders within the first 100 days. No more studies, it’s time to act!” Power to Change provides major investments to municipalities in Bethier-Maskinongé that were again impacted by flooding to help them adapt their infrastructure to face this new climate reality. The NDP will invest an additional $2.5 billion to protect people and their property from extreme weather events, such as floods. ""People in my riding were impacted by record floods again this year. Justin Trudeau adopted Stephen Harper’s weak reduction targets and Canada will only reach them 200 years too late.

NDP Statement on the Future of Canadian Media The NDP issued the following statement: ""Today, we learned that Capitales Médias Group is in jeopardy of folding in the near future. As the owner of several regional dailies in Quebec, its disappearance will inevitably lead to major job losses. As a result, many cities in Quebec could find themselves without a local media outlet. The media crisis in Canada is real and getting worse every day. More than 16,000 jobs have been lost in the last 10 years. The difficulties that Groupe Capitales Médias are facing are not isolated, but instead reflect difficulties affecting the entire media industry. The Liberals' inaction over the past four years has put our democracy, the competitiveness of our media companies, and Quebec's cultural distinction at risk. Instead of tackling the problem and putting all media on an equal footing, Justin Trudeau's Liberal government continues to give tax breaks to web giants – corporations that hide their profits in tax havens. The time for rhetoric is over! We need a global solution that also takes regional needs into account. The NDP is the only party standing up and demanding that our traditional media be treated fairly. A healthy media industry is essential for our democracy, and Canadians deserve to receive quality information.

After Trudeau tried to spin his record, Spirit said: “I think that I've heard these things before - four years ago actually.” Since Justin Trudeau first promised action four years ago, he: Openly mocked an activist who challenged him on the Liberals’ failure to clean up mercury-contaminated water in Grassy Narrows and fund a care home for poisoning victims;
Refused to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;
Dismissed locally elected Indigenous leaders in Saskatchewan, and said that what Indigenous youth really need is “a place to store their canoes and paddles”;

NDP Will Tax Multimillionaires to Fund Health Care HAMILTON – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is meeting with Canadians struggling with cuts to important services they rely on and the growing cost of health care expenses. Singh is proposing a tax on those with fortunes above $20 million to make sure hardworking Canadians get the services they need like pharmacare and head-to-toe health care. “New Democrats have the courage to make different choices. Unlike the Liberals and Conservatives who work for their rich and powerful friends, we will help people who are struggling to get by,” said Singh. “Our plan is simple – we can afford to help people when we have the courage to ask the super-rich to pay a little bit more to fund the services we all rely on.” For years, Liberals and Conservatives have been helping their corporate friends and the very richest to avoid taxes and hide billions offshore every year. New Democrats will bring in a tax on the multimillionaires alongside tougher enforcement to stop tax evasion both in Canada, and off-shore. “Families shouldn’t have to worry about their future. They deserve a government that is actually on their side. Canadians deserve prescription drugs covered by Medicare, and expanded health care services to cover people head-to-toe – and we can do this when the very richest pay their fair share,” concluded Singh. – 30 – Facts: The NDP’s super-wealth tax would apply a 1% tax on fortunes above $20 million.
This will be applied annually and include real estate, luxury items and investments.
This tax will apply to only the very wealthiest one tenth of one percent of Canadian households.
Over ten years, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates that this tax will raise almost $70 billion, starting with $5.6 billion in 2020-21 and growing to $9.5 billion by 2028-29.
It will be paired with boosted enforcement against tax evasion and penalties for millionaires who try to evade paying taxes, including regular CRA audits and third-party valuation of assets.
In June 2019, the Parliamentary Budget Officer found that Canada is losing up to $25 billion in tax revenues to overseas tax evasion by multinational corporations. ",2019-09-10

Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle Running for the NDP Trudeau let down Indigenous people, says Turtle OTTAWA – Chief Rudy Turtle of Grassy Narrows First Nation will be the NDP’s candidate in Kenora. Turtle and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced Turtle’s candidacy together on Monday in Ottawa. “I’m so proud to welcome Chief Turtle to our team,” said Singh. “Together, we’re going to fight to change the government — from one that works to make life easier for multi-millionaires and big corporations, to one that’s focused on making life better for people, including Indigenous people.” Turtle said he’s running because Justin Trudeau let Indigenous people and nations down, and chose the NDP because Singh and the New Democrats aren’t beholden to wealthy corporate interests. “Justin Trudeau promised us that he’d be different, but what we got was a Prime Minister that says the right thing in public, and does something else behind closed doors,” said Chief Turtle. “When corporations ask Trudeau for something, he goes to great lengths to make their lives easier. When Indigenous communities want to work with Trudeau — on issues from clean water to community safety — we get a condescending Prime Minister who is willing to pose at ceremonies, but not willing to take action to make people’s lives better. Like millions of others, I’m tired of being let down.” Grassy Narrows families have suffered from mercury poisoning because of a corporate chemical-dumping crime that poisoned the English and Wabigoon rivers in the 1960s and ‘70s. The Liberal government promised a much-needed mercury care facility to care for the sickest residents — but has been stalling, trying to get away with delivering much less than promised, or perhaps nothing at all. “I want to join a team that walks the walk of reconciliation,” said Turtle. “Jagmeet and the NDP aren’t here to make life better for multi-millionaires, they’re here to make life better for regular people. In my community, that means taking action to improve health care regardless of where you live, making life more affordable for families, and giving young people the opportunities they need to thrive in the North.” Turtle will be acclaimed as the nominee for Kenora, as the NDP nomination period for the riding has closed.

It’s Time for a New Deal for Northern Ontario Decades of Liberal and Conservative neglect of the North have hurt people. The NDP has a plan to make life more affordable for Northerners. SUDBURY – Today, NDP candidates Charlie Angus (Timmins-James Bay), Carol Hughes (Algoma–Manitoulin–Kapuskasing), Beth Mairs (Sudbury), Stef Paquette (Nickel Belt) and Rob Boulet (Nipissing-Timiskaming) announced a New Deal for Northern Ontario. For far too long, Northerners have been finding it harder to make ends meet. The Liberal and Conservative policies failed to address the significant challenges people face in the region, and the NDP knows it is time to do things differently. “Northern families are struggling to make ends meet while the Liberals are looking out for their corporate friends,” said Hughes. “In a country as rich as Canada, we need to do better, and we can do better. Liberals and Conservatives haven’t worked for us. Only Northern Ontario New Democrats have a plan to make life more affordable, advance reconciliation, and create jobs for the region.” Trudeau’s Liberals haven’t worked for Northern Ontario – they’ve made life more expensive and haven’t done enough on climate and to deliver better services for Indigenous communities. Andrew Scheer is just more of the same of what the North has gotten from Stephen Harper and Doug Ford – cuts to the services people need. “Both the Liberals and Conservatives have undermined the economic development of Northern Ontario by refusing to invest in FedNor and failing our people,” said Angus. “We will not sit idly by while our economy slows down because of their bad decisions. The NDP will give the North its due by finally making FedNor a stand-alone regional economic development agency. That's how we will pursue job growth, long-term development, and support the growth of co-operative, Indigenous, and community enterprises.” Creating jobs in the North, protecting our environment, and setting the terms of a true nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous people are all part of the NDP’s New Deal for Northern Ontario.

Reality Check: Liberals will Always Side with Big Telecom Companies Justin Trudeau is hinting once again that he might consider taking actions desperately needed to bring down the cost of cell phone bills — but only after an election, and people aren't buying it. ""Trudeau wants us to believe if we give him another chance, he won’t let us down this time.

Seems clear whose side Trudeau is on,” said NDP Innovation, Science and Economic Development Critic and candidate Brian Masse (Windsor West). Trudeau's record on big telecom companies includes: Two months ago, the Trudeau Liberals voted down a concrete plan that would have ended price-gouging for essential cell and internet services.

Canada Must Do More to Protect LGBTQ2+ Refugees NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Critic Jenny Kwan made the following statement:
		“Being LGBTQ2+ is a crime in more than 70 countries. And in 14 countries, people still face death or life imprisonment just for being who they are. Globally, there are some 41.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and for many LGBTQ2+ individuals, they live in fear of persecution. They can be arbitrarily arrested, detained or attacked, and too often have no other choice but to flee their country to find safety. But they face significant barriers in finding a safe passageway to make an asylum claim, let alone to reach a country that will provide them with protection as even if they manage to flee to another country, their existence is often still criminalized in the first country they enter. As such, far too many still can’t find safe passage and remain in grave danger. Canada used to have an immigration stream for the internally displaced, the Source-Country Class, but that was ended by the Harper government. New Democrats are calling for Canada to establish an updated program that provides a pathway to safety for internally displaced persons and establish a special measure to help resettle LGBTQ2+ IDPs. To draw in the strength of refugee civil society organizations on the ground, New Democrats are calling on the government to work collaboratively with organizations like the Canadian Rainbow Coalition for Refugees to help resettle LGBTQ2+ people in Canada. The Rainbow Refugee Assistance Program (RRAP) has proven to be a successful and valuable pilot program. It is time for it to be made a permanent initiative with adequate long-term funding; and increase annual resettlement targets. As well, in order to ensure the success of LGBTQ2+ individuals after their arrival in Canada, we must also bolster our resettlement efforts by ensuring settlement agencies are properly funded and resourced with trauma informed and SOGI trained staff. Canadians are proud of our humanitarian and compassionate effort. Let us continue to stand firm as a beacon of hope for persecuted LGBTQ2+ individuals.” ",2019-06-21

Trudeau’s Liberals had years to come to an agreement and solve the problem, but they didn’t. “Children and elders are suffering from mercury poisoning every day in Grassy Narrows,” said Turtle. “Justin Trudeau promised to build a treatment center to help our people. He had four years to fix the problem, but he failed. This isn’t how Reconciliation works.” Grassy Narrows families have suffered from mercury poisoning because of a corporate chemical-dumping crime that poisoned the English and Wabigoon rivers in the 1960s and ‘70s.

We will honour our treaties, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, close the health gap and renew the relationship between Canada and First Nations with an Action Plan on Reconciliation. Facts An independent study by Japanese researchers found that more than 90% of people in Grassy Narrows and nearby Wabaseemoong suffer from symptoms of mercury poisoning.
A 2015 scientific report found that there is ongoing contamination in lakes and rivers upstream of Grassy Narrows.
A 2018 report found that mercury exposure was linked to serious issues in children's health, including learning disabilities, language or speech disorders, anemia, and visual problems.
Only 6% of people in Grassy Narrows currently receive compensation from the mercury disability board, which relies on outdated medical criteria to assess eligibility.

It doesn’t have to be this way. We can make better choices.” Liberals and Conservatives have been asking families to work harder, dip into their savings or take on debt just for necessities like a place to call home, cell phone bills, medication, and dentist appointments.

Professor Hulchanski also pointed out that “the lowest year for housing expenditures since the 1970s was 2016, when housing accounted only 0.7 per cent of the federal budget.” (Globe and Mail)
And this week, a report notes that the federal government is doing “little to help” growing challenges with homelessness.

NDP Reaction to the Dairy Industry Compensation Package The NDP Agriculture Critic, Alistair MacGregor (Cowichan—Malahat—Langford), and Deputy Agriculture Critic, Ruth Ellen Brosseau (Berthier—Maskinongé), issued the following statement: ""Today’s announcement reminds us that in a single mandate, Justin Trudeau traded away nearly 8.4% of our dairy production and processing capacity. The Liberals, like the Conservatives before them, are gradually destroying our supply management system and the vitality of our agriculture system. Supply management has been the lifeblood of our regions, and it contributes to our food sovereignty. We should be proud of the system we implemented, and we must protect it, not use it as a bargaining chip during trade negotiations. New Democrats are not afraid to stand up to our trade partners to protect dairy farmers and the supply management system. We did it for CETA, for diafiltered milk, for CPTPP, for CUSMA and you can continue to count on us to stand up and speak out against any further concessions to the dairy sector. As government, we commit to never opening more breaches during future free trade negotiations. After promising to fully compensate the dairy industry, the Liberals announced a package that doesn’t make a clear long-term commitment over the first year in terms of direct paid compensations to producers and does not fully cover the losses incurred by CETA and CPTPP. And this, a couple of weeks before an election. The Liberals forgot about small processors and did not take any concrete commitment for compensation due to losses from CUSMA. The NDP is committed to fully compensating producers for losses due to all trade deals including CUSMA. We will also hold reciprocal standards with our business partners and give our farmers and producers equal footing when competing with foreign products in the Canadian marketplace. We must value and be proud of our local agriculture because products made here meet high quality standards."" ",2019-08-16

NDP Statement on the 36th anniversary of Black July Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement: In the days and nights between July 24 and 29, 1983, genocidal acts erupted in Sri Lanka. Countless mobs carried out brutal pogroms across the country, killing between 400 and 3,000 Tamils, and leaving 150,000 people without homes. These events started a 26-year civil war that sent hundreds of thousands of Tamils into exile. Today, New Democrats remember all those who suffered immeasurable losses during Black July, a cruel experience which, 36 years later, remains a time of mourning for the Tamil diaspora. As we recognize the suffering of all those who are still dealing with the trauma and displacement that arise with genocidal acts and civil war, let’s also remember to never be complacent about the power of hatred to divide us.

I would also like to express our solidarity and support for activists who deplore Canada's failure to meet its commitments to uphold human rights in Colombia through our trade agreements with that country. When the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement was signed in 2008 and implemented in 2011, the Canadian government committed to an annual human rights assessment of Colombia. Various freedoms, including those of expression and association, were and are still being violated in Colombia, and trade union activists were frequently targeted and even murdered. But the assessment process followed by the Canadian government, and the reports that are published annually, are inadequate and have been criticized by human rights organizations. In fact, Amnesty International Canada withdrew from this evaluation process in 2017. We call on the Canadian government to stop pretending to be concerned about the human rights situation in Colombia – and instead, take concrete steps to develop a more robust evaluation system and put pressure on the Colombian government when human rights are violated. Canada must also make sure that Canadian firms doing business in Colombia are accountable and are acting in full respect of human and workers' rights."" ",2019-07-20

Trudeau Doubles Down on Trade Negotiations with Brazil’s Bolsonaro While the Amazon Burns NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh released the following statement in response to Justin Trudeau’s refusal to stop negotiating a new free trade deal with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and the Mercosur group of nations. Last week, Singh called on Trudeau to stop negotiations to pressure Bolsonaro to change course to save the Amazon rainforest: “The Amazon rainforest is burning, and that’s not a crisis only for Brazil, it’s a crisis for humankind and for our planet. Once again, Justin Trudeau is putting the interest of rich corporations ahead of the fight against climate change by continuing free trade negotiations with President Bolsonaro. Last week, I called on Justin Trudeau to stop trade negotiations with President Bolsonaro in order to put real pressure on Brazil’s leadership to stop deforestation and start accepting help to fight these devastating fires. Trudeau has refused. Even as France and Ireland say they’ll block an EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement if Brazil doesn’t honour its environmental responsibilities, Trudeau keeps negotiating with Bolsonaro as if the earth isn’t burning up around them. This is another disturbing example of Justin Trudeau saying and tweeting pretty things in public, when behind closed doors he's doing business with the person responsible for the deforestation and devastation of the lungs of the planet. Experts have been clear: economic sanctions are the best tool we have to put pressure on President Bolsonaro, especially after he refused the help offered by the G7 members.

Singh Pitches a New Deal for Healthcare in Nanaimo NANAIMO – People in Nanaimo continue to make sacrifices to be able to afford the prescriptions they need. That’s why NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says the NDP’s New Deal for Healthcare includes a pharmacare system to provide prescription drug coverage and expands Medicare to cover dental care, mental health care, eye care and hearing care. “Nothing is more important than your family’s health,” said Singh. “But the Liberals have been focused on making life easier for wealthy pharmaceutical companies, holding back expansions of medicare to cover the medicine families need. And the Conservatives have now vowed to keep Stephen Harper’s cuts to health care in place — underfunding that would make health care worse every single year. We will make different choices. New Democrats will implement a comprehensive pharmacare system so that regardless of your job situation – you just need your health card – not your credit card – at the pharmacy.” Harper’s Conservatives cut healthcare transfers to the provinces, Justin Trudeau maintained the Conservatives’ cuts, and last week Andrew Scheer promised to maintain those cuts, creating a $31 billion shortfall across Canada over 10 years. Elizabeth May’s focus has never been health care, and she says implementing pharmacare should wait for years. “People in Nanaimo are struggling to afford their medication. In the meantime, the Liberals and Conservatives are fighting over who is best to shrink your healthcare services,” added Bob Chamberlin, NDP candidate for Nanaimo – Ladysmith. “Our New Deal for Healthcare will save your family more than $500 a year, even if you already have insurance.” New Democrats will begin working with the provinces right away to target a late 2020 start date, with an annual federal investment of $10 billion. Key facts Under the Liberals, Canada’s social spending is among the lowest in the industrialized world – even lower than it was in the 1990s.
The Liberals met with big pharma and insurance companies more than 700 times and have received more than $30,000 since they’ve been elected.
Canada is the only industrialized country in the world with universal healthcare that doesn’t cover medication.
Nearly two million Canadians reported not being able to afford one or more drugs in the past year, often resulting in additional doctor visits and hospital admissions.
Hundreds of premature deaths occur each year among working age Canadians unable to afford their prescription medications.  ",2019-08-06

NDP Highlights Liberal Failures on Housing Trudeau spending less on affordable housing than Harper OTTAWA – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pledged his support for families struggling with the high cost of housing and underscored the Liberal government’s failure to provide the help people need on affordable housing. “Across this country, I hear from people struggling to keep a roof over their heads. They tell me they lie awake at night worrying that they won’t be able to make ends meet each month,”said Singh. “I meet young moms and dads, students, and seniors who have seen things get worse over the last four years as the Liberals ignored the housing crisis. I’m here to tell them, New Democrats see you and we’re on your side.” Years of Liberal and Conservative governments have forced Canadians to fend for themselves as housing costs go up and the availability of suitable places to live goes down. The Parliamentary Budget Officer recently found that the Liberals’ National Housing Strategy will spend 19% less on affordable housing as a percentage of nominal GDP than the ten years previous. “The economy is doing well, but not for everyone,” said Singh. “We need to do better to make sure that everyone has a safe and affordable place to call home. That’s why New Democrats will make affordable housing a priority, and work with communities to expand and improve existing housing, to reduce energy demand, create jobs and save people money every single month.” Jagmeet’s New Deal for People is a bold plan to address the housing crisis which the Liberals have neglected for the last four years. The NDP’s plan includes a pledge to build 500,000 new affordable homes across the country within a decade, as well as help for no-cost energy efficiency upgrades that will save money and create jobs.

We put it to him, and people have asked him, would he be willing to put in place our wealth tax on the super wealthy? He hasn’t said yes. “No other party is willing to say we’re going to make sure that the richest Canadians, those who have fortunes of over $20 million, pay their fair share. Everyone else, Canadians, hardworking families, middle-class families, they’re paying their fair share. They don’t need to pay any more of the burden. “We’re not going to raise taxes on middle-class and working-class families. But we’re asking the richest to pay their fair share. Mr. Trudeau is not willing to do that.” After Trudeau was dubbed “Robin Hood” in the last election, his 2019 platform lets the top 1% completely off the hook while offering nothing for Canadians struggling with rising costs like housing and prescription drugs. Canada’s 87 richest families hold as much wealth as 12 million Canadians. Singh has made implementing a super-wealth tax on fortunes over $20 million an urgent priority in the next Parliament.

The Conservatives – federally and provincially – have demonstrated over and over that they don’t want to expand public health care coverage for people. Canadians just have to look to Ontario to see the proof of Conservative cuts to health care. Under Doug Ford’s Conservatives, the provincial government: Cut drug coverage for youth under 25;
Cut paramedic services;
Put essential programs for disease control, immunization, food and water safety and more at risk by cutting public health;
Cut out of country health coverage;
Opened the door to more privatization of health care. “Andrew Scheer will promise people a few more dollars – but he’ll cut our services. The Conservatives can’t be trusted with the health care services we all rely on. And Justin Trudeau implemented the Conservative’s cuts to planned health care spending,” added Singh. “We can make better choices. New Democrats take your health and pocketbook seriously – after decades of Liberal and Conservative cuts – our plan for you starts with prescription drug coverage for every Canadian, and more services to keep you and your family healthy for less.” New Democrats are committed to strengthening public health care and expanding it to make sure everyone is covered for the care they need to get and stay healthier longer. “Andrew Scheer is promising the status quo — and even that isn’t all that believable when we look at the history,” said Singh. “No matter what they tell you before an election, Conservatives cut health care after the election.” ",2019-08-01

Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have spent years ignoring or silencing voices they didn’t want to hear. Seven experts resigned from an oversight advisory board, saying the Liberal government “betrayed” them by giving no powers to a new government watchdog that would investigate overseas human rights abuses by corporations.
The vice-chair of the Liberal government’s Canadian Firearms Advisory Committee resigned calling the Liberal government “timid” on action to prevent gun violence.
Justin Trudeau booted Ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from his Liberal caucus for their courageous decision to speak up about his office’s wrongdoing.
His former parliamentary secretary resigned from the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent after the SNC-Lavalin scandal.
A lawyer resigned from the national Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, citing “a pattern of interference from the federal government”.
When he realized the results did not benefit his party, Justin Trudeau refused to implement the all-party recommendations of the Special Committee on Electoral Reform. Mr. Trudeau likes to say that the Liberal Party is listening to Canadians. But his Party has a record of hearing only what they like – and leaving the rest.

The NDP is committed to bringing together all levels of government with business and labour leaders to develop a national industrial strategy that will retain and provide good middle-class jobs to Canadian workers. “This is very sad news for Bombardier workers and their families. These jobs are not only crucial for the region and for our economy, but they are the source of livelihood for hundreds of families,” said the NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “We saw what happened in Oshawa and Windsor. And now, it is the people of Thunder Bay who will pay the ultimate price of losing their jobs. Trudeau’s Liberals have failed time and time again to fight for workers. New Democrats will always put the interest of workers first.” Bombardier decided to cut jobs after Trudeau’s Liberals bailed them out with $372.5 million in 2017. Yet again, Trudeau’s Liberals gave massive giveaways to corporations without any guarantee that jobs will be protected or remain in Canada. New Democrats know that the manufacturing sector is vital for communities across the country and are committed to fighting for a strong and robust future for Canadian manufacturing “While workers are reeling the impacts of losing their jobs, CEOs and rich shareholders will have no problem sleeping tonight,” said NDP candidate Yuk-Sem Won (Thunder Bay—Rainy River). “Trudeau’s Liberals have a choice to make, either they’re on the side of working people or rich CEOs.

NDP: Liberals Abandon Seniors with Meagre OAS and GIS Increases POWELL RIVER – On July 1, Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) payments increased, but according to Réseau FADOQ, the combined increases work out to only an extra $12-16 per month. NDP Seniors Affairs Critic Rachel Blaney noted that seniors are understandably unimpressed. “Does this government really think that $12-16 a month is going to make a significant difference in the lives of seniors? That doesn’t even cover a typical annual rent or property tax increase in Canada, which means that most seniors will have a harder time making ends meet than before. We know that poverty amongst seniors in Canada is on the rise, and $16 won’t fix that,” said Blaney. “Instead of pretending that the cost of a single lunch is enough to improve the lives of seniors, seniors need a government that takes real action. Universal pharmacare will save families across Canada an average of $500 per year, and seniors will undoubtedly be better off. There are far too many seniors in this country who are going hungry, cutting their pills in half, or foregoing their medication entirely because of affordability issues. We will make different choices and bring in universal drug coverage,” added Blaney. The housing crisis is heavily impacting seniors across Canada. The lack of accessible housing poses challenges to many seniors, and wait-times for long-term care facilities can stretch into years. These supply constraints have pushed prices through the roof, and seniors’ incomes simply have not kept pace. Blaney added that too many seniors in receipt of GIS will be shocked to learn that they no longer receive it this month. “It’s a problem I’ve heard time and time again. Seniors, for one of life’s many reasons, don’t get their taxes in on time. As soon as July 1 rolls around, the income they rely on to pay their rent or feed themselves doesn’t arrive.” In 2018, almost 40,000 seniors had their GIS suspended. Rachel’s Private Member’s Bill C-449 would have solved this issue, granting seniors in receipt of GIS a one-year grace-period to complete their taxes. The current Liberal government is not prepared to deal with Canada’s changing demographics and higher proportion of seniors. And the Conservatives are telling people to go at it alone. Band-aid solutions and paltry benefit increases can only work for so long. We need a holistic plan for the present and future, a National Seniors Strategy will ensure that we are taking proper care of those who made this beautiful country what it is today. ",2019-07-04

The NDP’s New Deal for People will ensure that pensioners are at the front of the line when a company goes bankrupt – making sure unfunded pension liabilities owed to workers, and employees’ severance pay, are the top priority. “If it wasn’t for the Liberals letting big corporations off the hook for pension theft, Sears Canada workers would not have to carry the weight of legal fees to fight for what is rightfully theirs,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Liberals and Conservatives turned their back on workers to make life easier for a big company and their executives.” The NDP's plan will stop companies from paying out bosses when people’s pensions are underfunded, and will create a mandatory, industry-financed pension insurance program. NDP Critic for Pensions, Scott Duvall (Hamilton Mountain), introduced a bill in the House of Commons that aimed to change bankruptcy and insolvency law to stop pension theft by big corporations. “Trudeau’s Liberals and Scheer’s Conservatives have done nothing to help workers whose pensions have been taken away from them because of corporate greed,” said Duvall. “Instead of strengthening support for Canadian workers and retirees, they have sided with rich corporations to undermine retirement benefits. This is wrong. New Democrats believe that every Canadian should be able to count on a dignified, secure retirement – and we’ll fight hard to protect pensions that workers have earned.” ",2019-08-08

The NDP is on Your Side to Make Life Better and More Affordable OTTAWA – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh marked the end of the parliamentary session on a strong note reminding people that an NDP MP is someone who stands up for everyday people. Over the last four years, the NDP fought to make life more affordable, to protect our environment, to reduce inequalities and defend workers’ rights. Meanwhile, Trudeau’s Liberals and Scheer’s Conservatives took the side of the richest corporations and helped them profit on the backs of everyday Canadians. “Trudeau’s sales pitch doesn’t match his actions. When push comes to shove, he always picks the rich and the well-connected over everyday Canadians. And people are still paying the price from the last Conservative government. The Conservatives are telling people they have to go at it alone. This is the wrong approach,” said Singh. “People deserve a government that will fight for them and put their interests over those of rich corporations. With different choices, the NDP will get better results for people.” Over the course of this parliamentary session, the NDP introduced bold solutions to make people's lives better. The NDP caucus passed motions to encourage the buying and production of local food, to create a national suicide action plan, and to encourage buying Canadian wood for our buildings. Alongside stakeholders, the NDP finally got the oil tanker ban that will safeguard our coastline, communities, and sea life from the risk of a devastating oil spill. NDP MP Romeo Saganash (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou) introduced the historic bill C-262 that aims to harmonize Canadian laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. “While the Liberals were picking and choosing which rights of Indigenous peoples they’d uphold, Romeo Saganash was pushing them to enshrine into our laws the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People,” added Singh. “It is shameful that unelected and unaccountable Conservative Senators are blocking the passage of the bill in its last legislative stages. Indigenous Peoples deserve better.” Throughout the four years, the NDP always put solutions for people front and centre in everything they did. They presented plans to give Canadians access to affordable housing, access to affordable medication with a universal and public pharmacare program, priority over the richest corporations and needed roadmaps with concrete measures to fight climate change. New Democrats are committed to continue to fight for people and are excited to bring their message to Canadians from coast to coast to coast. With an NDP MP, people have someone who is on their side, ready to put your interests first. ",2019-06-20

Reality Check: Liberals Side with Big Business Time and Again On Labour Day, NDP promises a $15 minimum wage, blasts Trudeau for blocking it! OTTAWA – On Labour Day, Justin Trudeau is marking four years of letting down Canadians workers: On respecting labour rights: In 2018, the Trudeau Liberals forced Canada Post workers back to work [1] - even invoking super-closure, making it clear they were on Canada Post’s side, not workers looking for a fair deal.[2] When big business asked for exemptions to Canada Labour Code provisions meant to protect workers, the Liberals caved  – granting them an opt-out before the law was even in force.[3] With Canada’s hugely profitable banking sector securing no fewer than 25 meetings with the Liberal government on labour issues sine 2015, it’s clear who has Justin Trudeau’s ear.[4] On the minimum wage: During the 2015 election, Justin Trudeau attacking the idea of a $15 per hour federal minimum wage[5] - and later told a business audience that he opposed raising it because ""it's not just about putting a little more money in peoples' pockets.""[6] In 2017, Justin Trudeau lectured a business audience in Germany and saying that “[i]t’s time to pay a living wage,”[7] then refused to even establish a $15 per hour minimum wage for Canadians. On banning scabs: In 2010, Justin Trudeau voted in favour of anti-scab legislation while in opposition.[8] In 2016, the Trudeau Liberals voted down NDP legislation that would ban the use of replacement workers.[9] According to an issue paper from Employment and Social Development Canada, an increase in the federal minimum wage “has been found to increase job stability”, would “reduce the gender wage gap” and would even benefit other workers making above the minimum wage.[10] “Justin Trudeau says what workers want to hear in public, then bends over backwards to make life easier for his corporate friends – that’s on his record,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “New Democrats know whose side we’re on. We’re in it for working people, and we owe big business nothing.” -30- [1] https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=10194193 [2] https://www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/votes/42/1/947/ [3] https://thelogic.co/news/exclusive/liberals-to-exempt-large-firms-from-elements-of-new-labour-code-after-federal-election/ [4] Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada, monthly communication reports for RBC, CIBC, Scotiabank, BMO, TD and the Canadian Bankers Association.

NDP Statement on the 6th anniversary of the Lac-Mégantic tragedy Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement: It’s been six years since the tragedy in Lac-Mégantic, but residents are still recovering from the fiery train derailment that destroyed their town centre and took the lives of 47 people. On behalf of New Democrats, I would like to assure all those affected by this tragedy that our thoughts are with you, today and every day, as you continue to heal from this disaster. It’s deeply sad that it took a tragedy of this magnitude to remind Canadians of the need for stricter rail regulations. The NDP continues to call for an inquiry into the longstanding problems with our country’s rail safety measures, especially in regards to the transportation of dangerous goods. Although the Liberal government chose to maintain the voluntary arrangements with rail companies that were established by the Conservatives before them and which removed some much needed risk assessment inspections, we continue to fight. Voluntary agreements will not protect Canadians from another tragedy like this one. It’s been six years and there may be a new rail bypass around the Lac-Mégantic community, but that will not erase people’s memory of that heartbreaking night. What their community needed, and which we still need, are stricter rail safety standards to ensure that people stop paying the price of political inaction through the senseless loss of lives.

Human Rights Tribunal Ruling Shows Trudeau and Conservatives Both Failed Indigenous Children OTTAWA – NDP MP Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay) and candidates Chief Rudy Turtle (Kenora, ON) and former Nishnawbe Aski Nation Deputy Grand Chief Anna Betty Achneepineskum (Thunder Bay—Superior North) called today’s ruling from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal a searing indictment of Liberal and Conservative governments’ failure to make life better for Indigenous children. “This ruling shows just how badly both Justin Trudeau and Conservatives have failed Indigenous children in this country,” said Angus. “The Tribunal found that the government acted completely recklessly. One decision and four compliance orders later, and the government is still trying to run away from its responsibilities.” The tribunal ordered the government to pay compensation to First Nations children apprehended by child and family services agencies, as well as their families. “Justin Trudeau and the Conservatives have spent millions on lawyers to fight against the rights of First Nation children and their families,” said Turtle, the chief of Grassy Narrows First Nation. “The Tribunal ruled years ago that the government’s policies were discriminatory against Indigenous people and violated our human rights. Justin Trudeau should listen to the Assembly of First Nations and accept this decision. Our children have suffered, and they need to make this right.” “We are the only party serious about a new relationship with Indigenous people,” said Achneepineskum. “We will honour the call for a Spirit Bear Plan to end inequalities in service that Indigenous children face in this country.

Pretty Words and Empty Promises: Justin Trudeau’s Record on Taxing the Top 1% Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh takes his message to the Canadian Club: that the richest Canadians and corporations should pay more to make life better and more affordable for everyone else. Justin Trudeau likes to talk about taxing the rich. Back in 2015, he told the Canadian Club: ""I know people in your position get asked for a lot, and as evidenced by the thriving and generous philanthropic culture in Canada, you step up. Your contributions to Canadian society have been appreciated — and I'm asking for one more."" (CBC, May 11, 2015) But here’s what he actually did: Trudeau’s so-called middle-class tax cut actually meant two-thirds of Canadians got $0 – while the 1% got a $675 tax cut.
He recently handed $14 billion in giveaways to big corporations.
A $12 million giveaway to Loblaws, one of Canada’s largest companies.

And when his chief fundraiser Stephen Bronfman was named in the Paradise Papers for his apparent use of an offshore trust to evade taxes, instead of standing up for Canadian taxpayers, Justin Trudeau jumped to Bronfman’s defense.

Jagmeet Singh Fights for Good Jobs in Thunder Bay Proposes new investments in electric transit across Canada THUNDER BAY – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP candidates Yuk-Sem Won (Thunder Bay—Rainy River) and  Anna Betty Achneepineskum (Thunder Bay—Superior North) stood with hundreds of workers facing layoffs at the Thunder Bay Bombardier plant today to call for federal leadership on electric transit and Canadian procurement to keep good jobs here in Canada. “These workers and their families are paying the price for Liberal inaction,” said Singh. “The Liberals saw these layoffs coming and did nothing. It’s devastating. We need to be building more electric trains right here in Canada, not laying workers off – and making sure that the public money we spend on transit and infrastructure helps create good jobs in our communities.” These layoffs come in the wake of Via Rail selecting a German rail manufacturer for a nearly $1 billion contract, and ramped-up Buy American provisions that shut Canadian companies out of lucrative contracts. The Liberals have stood by as these contracts were lost, while doing nothing to promote procurement policies that support Canadian jobs. “These jobs are vital to our community, and the Liberals aren’t fighting for them,” said Won. “It’s time to make different choices – with Jagmeet’s New Deal for People, we can protect good jobs in Thunder Bay and create even more opportunity building the infrastructure we need to confront the climate crisis.” “Workers at Bombardier and across Canada who face similar employment losses need proactive measures and investments by the federal government,” said Achneepineskum. “The lay-off notice could have been prevented if the Liberals were committed to protecting jobs. They're clearly not. An NDP government will not think twice when it comes to standing for workers.” Electrifying all municipal transit fleets by 2030, expanding electric rail and building these vehicles in Canada are part of the NDP’s commitments in Power to Change: A new deal for climate action and good jobs. Facts Bombardier will be cutting 550 jobs at the Thunder Bay plant, half of the current workforce. Bombardier is the largest private-sector employer in Thunder Bay.
In 2018, Via Rail selected German manufacturer Siemens for a $989 million contract to modernize its passenger rail service, in a contract that does not require any local content. The rail cars will be built in California.
In 2017, the Liberals provided $372.5 million in interest-free loans to Bombardier without securing job guarantees – laying off thousands, as their top executives increased their multi-million dollar salaries by almost half.[i] [i] Marowits, Ross. “Bombardier exec compensation ballooned as company sought massive government handouts,” The Canadian Press, March 29, 2017.

Another Study Highlights How Universal Pharmacare Will Help People Make Ends Meet NDP will immediately bring in a universal, comprehensive pharmacare program in 2020 OTTAWA – Today, NDP candidate Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway) is highlighting the release of a study done by St. Michael’s Hospital’s MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions that found that providing Ontarians with free access to essential medicines improves medicine adherence, control of blood pressure and control of diabetes. The report also found that there is a large increase – from 33 % to 86% – in people’s ability to ""make ends meet"" and afford basic necessities such as food and rent when access to medicine is provided. “Across Canada, people are having to make impossible choices every day – cutting pills in half, choosing between paying rent or filling their prescription, or going without the drugs they need altogether,” said Davies. “It doesn’t have to be this way. Trudeau’s Liberals could have chosen to stand up for Canadians and bring in drug coverage, but instead they listened to lobbyists and chose not to act. New Democrats will do the right thing and invest in Canadians' health.” Even though experts say we could have better health care, lower costs, and savings for families, pharmacare has been stalled for years. The Conservatives spent a decade making the problem worse. And Trudeau’s Liberal government let big pharmaceutical and insurance companies keep charging Canadians some of the highest drug prices in the world. “Justin Trudeau told Canadians he’d help, but behind closed doors, he listened to his insider friends. Canadians deserve better,” said Davies. “They deserve leaders with the courage to stand up to big pharmaceutical and insurance companies, and work for a solution that will make life better for everyday people. We know we can cover every Canadian through our public system, and save families more than $500 a year.""

Our plan to fight climate change will create at least 300,000 new jobs, save families money, and take on big polluters. We’re going to follow the science and do what’s needed to keep warming below 1.5 degrees,” said Singh. At the Kingston Farmer’s Market, Singh talked with local farmers about how the changing climate is impacting them, as growing conditions become more unpredictable. Despite the importance of our food system in confronting the climate crisis, Liberal and Conservative governments have left farmers to struggle with a rapidly changing climate and mounting financial stress on their own – while Canadian families want more access to local food. “When we support local farmers – everyone wins. Buying locally grown products is good for the environment and the economy,” said Singh. “When it comes to the climate crisis, we’re all in this together – and more healthy local food on Canadians’ plates is part of the solution.” The NDP’s New Deal for People commits to a Canadian Food Strategy that will help connect Canadians to farmers with initiatives like local food hubs that link local producers to consumers, and community-supported agriculture, so people can enjoy healthy, local food while doing their part to tackle climate change.

Vaughan and Liberals Can’t Escape Empty Promises on Affordable Housing In June, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office found that Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan’s housing plan spends 19% less as a percentage of GDP than the Conservative plan did. Since then, Adam Vaughan has worked overtime to discredit the independent PBO’s analysis. But it’s not just the PBO that says the Liberals have failed. University of Toronto Professor David Hulchanski said that “the Liberal Party and even CMHC have mixed all these together into big sounding amounts, as if a great deal is happening. But not much is happening in terms of meeting housing need and existing spending on housing remains at a historically low percentage of the federal budget.” Hulchanksi has also described the housing strategy as “a public relations gimmick.” In August, Vaughan claimed a planned sale of the Queens Quay lands without affordable housing was out of government’s hands. The next week, the Liberals reversed course in the face of pressure from Jagmeet Singh and Councillor Joe Cressy. Meanwhile in Toronto, there are no neighbourhoods left where a person putting in full-time work for minimum wage can afford a modest one-bedroom apartment.

They’re letting down people who live on and enjoy Quesnel Lake, and Canadians should worry about the precedent being set here. If you’re a big company, this government is saying that there’s no accountability.” The 2014 disaster was the result of a failure of the tailings dam, which sent 24 million cubic metres of mining waste into Quesnel Lake.

""Families have been torn apart, and lives have been devastated. With the Johnson & Johnson decision, grieving parents in Canada are left to wonder if opioid manufacturers also marketed these products to Canadians and Canadian doctors in a way that skirted federal law,"" added Davies. ''It's time to launch civil action, and a federal investigation to determine whether criminal charges are warranted against opioid manufacturers and distributors for their alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis. Families who lost a loved one to this crisis deserve answers."" Jagmeet Singh and the NDP have vowed, if elected, to immediately declare a public health emergency and launch an investigation into the role drug companies may have played in fueling the opioid crisis, seeking meaningful financial compensation for the costs of this crisis. The NDP is also committed to supporting overdose prevention sites and expanding access to addictions treatment. Facts: Last summer, the NDP government of British Columbia filed a civil lawsuit against drug companies to recoup the enormous costs incurred by that province in addressing the crisis. This year, the government of Ontario announced they would join B.C.'s lawsuit.
In addition to Monday's ruling, the United States Department of Justice has already secured criminal pleas and, along with dozens of states, over $600 million in damages from opioid manufacturers for misbranding offences in that country.
From 2011 to 2016 alone, provincial drug plans across Canada spent $548.6 million on medications to treat addictions to prescription and illicit opioids. Hundreds of millions of dollars more were spent by governments for emergency room visits, first responders and treatment programs. ",2019-08-27

Another Environmentalist Joins the NDP The NDP offers a bold plan on climate change and good jobs
		LONGUEUIL — NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in the riding of Longueuil-Saint-Hubert to introduce the NDP’s candidate for the federal election on October 21, Éric Ferland. He was accompanied by the NDP's Deputy Leader and Environment Critic, Alexandre Boulerice. “I'm proud to welcome Éric Ferland as the NDP candidate for Longueuil-Saint-Hubert. Éric is a celebrated environmental activist, notably as a co-founder and Executive Director of the Foire Écosphère, which has been organizing the largest environment-related public events in Quebec for the past 14 years. The nominations of Hugo Latulippe and Éric Ferland show a growing consensus that the NDP is the only party with a clear plan and path forward to ensure that both people and the environment win.” While Éric Ferland has built a strong reputation in the environmental field, he also has an excellent reputation in the community and cultural sectors. On the political front, he served for 12 years as a municipal councillor in Frelighsburg, where he established recycling infrastructure, collaborated on forestry issues, and promoted an architectural integration and development plan. He is also the former Leader of the Quebec Green Party. ""Today, I am responding to Jagmeet Singh and the NDP's open invitation to progressives in Quebec. Quebecers want to fight the climate crisis! We could do so much more working together with a government that gives people the tools they need to make change,"" said Ferland. ""The NDP is the only party that recognizes the importance of responding to the climate emergency while addressing growing social inequalities."" ""One week after announcing Hugo Latulippe's candidacy, it is now environmentalist Eric Ferland’s turn to join the NDP,"" added Boulerice. “The decisions made by Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, like buying a pipeline with taxpayers' money, doesn't sit well with Quebecers. Only the NDP has the courage to take action to fight climate change, while delivering concrete help that improves everyone’s lives.” Power to Change: A New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs The NDP's plan to fight climate change: Our $15 billion climate plan will allow us to seriously address climate change while creating more than 300,000 jobs.
It will allow us to achieve ambitious, science-based targets for reducing our emissions.
It will create a Climate Bank to finance green energy projects.
It will help people renovate their homes to make them more energy efficient, and increase the number of zero-emission vehicles on our roads.
It will provide our municipalities with the necessary resources to make public transit better and more affordable across the country. ",2019-09-16

NDP Statement on the Anniversary of the Dieppe Raid Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement: “On this day in 1942, Allied Forces launched a major raid on the French coastal port of Dieppe. The raid was a catastrophe. Of the 6,086 soldiers who made it ashore, 3,623 were killed, wounded, or captured. 907 of these soldiers were Canadian, the greatest loss of all participating Allied forces, prompting Churchill to state that it ‘was a Canadian contribution of the greatest significance to final victory’. The Dieppe raid was a significant setback, but it provided valuable lessons of what not to do in amphibious assaults, and laid the framework for the Normandy landings two years later, and the Allies’ eventual victory. On this Anniversary of the Dieppe Raid let us remember the great courage of our brave soldiers on that historic day, 77 years ago. Let’s also take a moment today to remember the families who lost their loved ones, the men and women who endured years of harsh treatment in prison, and those who came home forever scarred by a most brutal war.” ",2019-08-19

The NPD Calls for the Recognition of Indigenous Peoples in the Oath of Office as Members of Parliament OTTAWA — New Democrat MPs Jenny Kwan, Pierre Nantel, and Roméo Saganash are calling for treaties with Indigenous Peoples to be added to the Oath of Office of federal MPs. “Including Indigenous Peoples in the oath of citizenship is a small but necessary step towards reconciliation,” said Saganash (Abitibi–Baie-James–Nunavik–Eeyou). “How can we expect new citizens to solemnly recognize Indigenous Peoples when our elected officials are not even asked to recognize Indigenous rights and treaties?” In October 2015, NDP MPs Georgina Jolibois, Niki Ashton, Pierre Nantel, and Roméo Saganash became the first federal elected officials to change their oath by adding a reference to Indigenous Peoples. At the time, they stated that, ""in the performance of [their] duties, they would [respect] the treaties concluded with Indigenous Peoples.” “Elected officials have a responsibility to respect these rights and treaties that were signed on a nation-to-nation basis,” added Nantel (Longueuil–Saint-Hubert). “Such a promise should be mandatory for every MP in Ottawa.” The NDP will introduce amendments to Bill C-99 to amend the Parliament of Canada Act to add respect for the treaties signed with Indigenous Peoples to the Oath of Office contained in a schedule to the Constitution Act of 1867. “This change to the Oath of Office for Members of Parliament is not just a symbolic gesture; it will help guide the work of Members of Parliament so that every law we make honours the UN Declaration for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples enshrined under Bill C-262,” added Kwan (Vancouver East).

NDP: Stronger Action Needed to Protect Wood Buffalo National Park OTTAWA – At a meeting this week, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee expressed serious concern about the continued deterioration of Wood Buffalo National Park and warned Canada the site could be added to the List of World Heritage in Danger. Following the meeting, the NDP is once again calling on the Liberal government to better protect Canada’s largest national park. “UNESCO’s findings should be a wake-up call for the Liberal government. Continued expansion of the oilsands threatens our natural heritage and the climate. We must protect both for our future generations,” said NDP National Parks Critic Wayne Stetski (Kootenay – Columbia). “It would be an international embarrassment if Wood Buffalo National Park loses its World Heritage Status because of this Liberal government’s inaction.” UNESCO has been reviewing the state of the park following a request by the Mikisew Cree First Nation. The park is home to the world’s largest herd of free-ranging bison, as well as the only nesting ground of endangered whooping cranes. The Committee has given Canada until December 2020 to provide risk assessments of the Site C Dam and adjacent oilsands development. “As Canada seeks World Heritage Site designation for additional deserving sites, including Writing On Stone Provincial Park in southern Alberta, UNESCO will understandably be querying the credibility of this government to commit the resources needed to genuinely protect a world heritage site,” added NDP Deputy Critic for Environment and Climate Change Linda Duncan (Edmonton Strathcona). Unlike Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, a New Democrat government will protect 30% of our land, freshwater, and oceans by 2030 and back those protections with funding and enforcement.

Reality Check: 100 Days to Go - Let’s Look at the Record With 100 days left to go before election day, the Liberal and Conservatives keep working for the wealthy and powerful – and breaking their commitments to the rest of us. They make the rich richer – and we pay the price. They give them what they want – and take from what we need. Justin Trudeau charmed us last election with pretty words and empty promises – but he’s been working for his corporate friends just like Stephen Harper did. Trudeau has let big polluters off the hook.
He let the cell phone and credit card companies rip us off.
He let the big drug companies deny us affordable prescription drugs.
He kept big tax breaks and giant loopholes for corporations evading taxes.
And he’s even continued the Conservative cuts to health care – one of the Liberals’ dirty little secrets. Mr.Trudeau hugs us in public – and works for his powerful friends behind closed doors. The Conservatives also always make sure their corporate friends benefit more. Andrew Scheer will promise you a few more dollars – but he’ll cut services and cost you more. But it doesn’t have to be this way. In 100 days, Canadians will have the chance to elect a government that finally works for you. The NDP New Deal invests in families, makes life more affordable and fights the climate crisis. Head-to-toe health care starting with Pharmacare; affordable childcare, tuition and housing; lower cellphone and internet bills; taxing the top of the top 1%; closing corporate tax loopholes and cracking down on tax evasion; and a serious climate plan that creates new jobs and makes big polluters pay.

NDP Brings New Deal for People to Toronto In this election, the people of Toronto know that the NDP is In It for You OTTAWA – Today, in Toronto-Danforth surrounded by candidates and a packed theatre of 800 supporters, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh talked about his New Deal for People that invests in the services people need, makes life more affordable and fights the climate crisis. “For too long, Liberal and Conservative governments in Ottawa keep making life easier for the rich, and harder for everybody else,” said Singh. “People in Toronto, and throughout the country, are working hard, and are just looking to be treated fairly. These are the people the NDP has always worked for. These are the people I’m in it for.” Singh was introduced by former NDP MP Olivia Chow and Toronto City Councillor Mike Layton at the event, which took place in Jack Layton’s former riding of Toronto-Danforth.

In the face of Doug Ford’s Conservative cuts, people in Toronto have been let down by Justin Trudeau’s pretty words and empty promises. Trudeau has been clear that he will not stand up to Ford’s cuts to child care and health services. “Liberals and Conservatives have shown they are in it for their rich friends, not for you,” added Singh. “New Democrats are different. We are offering A New Deal for People. We won’t just say the right things, we will actually do them. We want people in Toronto to know we are all in it for you!

The NDP’s Cycling Strategy: Solutions to Help People Tackle Traffic and Climate Change OTTAWA – Surrounded by Ottawa candidates, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced that a New Democrat government would implement a cycling strategy to fight climate change and support community planning and design that makes travel safe, convenient and comfortable for everyone, regardless of their mode of transportation. “Canadians are paying the price of the consequences of climate change every day. But instead of taking bold action to confront the climate crisis, Justin Trudeau spent $4.5 billion to buy a pipeline and put our environment at risk,” said Singh. “It’s time for a New Deal to actually win the fight against the climate crisis and encourage active transportation that is safe, practical and recreational.” Quality transit is essential in making our cities run and we must do better to reduce traffic in Ottawa, which has hit record levels of congestion. As an avid cyclist, Jagmeet understands the intrinsic beauty of cycling and its practical application, commuting by bike to the House of Commons when in Ottawa. “People in Ottawa want to do their part to reduce carbon emissions by not driving their cars unnecessarily, but they’re too afraid to get hit. And yet, Trudeau’s Liberals refused to invest to unlock the potential of active transportation which would make it safer for bikers, and reduce emissions and the constant congestion,” said NDP candidate Emilie Taman (Ottawa Centre). “With our plan, everyone will be able to get around by bicycle safely and conveniently.” “The people I meet want to do more to tackle climate change, but they need their governments to give them the tools to do it and their long commutes aren’t working from them,” added NDP candidate Angella MacEwen (Ottawa West – Nepean). “People deserve better. Jagmeet has an ambitious plan to build the future that we all want to give to our children.” “People had high hopes, but the Liberals have let us down. The real reason people are feeling this level of climate change impacts is because successive Liberal and Conservative governments have let the biggest polluters off the hook,” said NDP candidate Morgan Gay (Ottawa South). “People want change. With different choices, we can get better results.” Key facts: Ottawa drivers have spent an average of 107 hours stuck in congestion in 2018 and the situation is only getting worse. In 2016, it was only 31.5 hours.
Sadly, less than 5% of all commuters bike to work in Ottawa (inside greenbelt, census 2016), as compared to 62% of Copenhageners that use their bike for their daily transport. These low rates are understandable when active transportation in Ottawa can be such a hazardous undertaking.  ",2019-07-11

From the 44-hour work week to paid maternity leave, many significant battles have been fought and won. New Democrats are proud to have walked with labour all these decades. But the fight to defend workers is not over. Precarious jobs are on the rise, wages are stagnating, and everyday costs are rising.

Millions of Canadians are struggling to pay the bills every month – even when they work full time. While the cost of housing, medication, and other necessities have skyrocketed, wages haven’t kept up – and that’s because decades of Liberal and Conservative governments have sided with big corporations instead of people. Justin Trudeau promised he’d bring fairness to workplaces across Canada, but he’s sided with big business and betrayed workers, too.

NDP Worried about Liberals Secretive Plans to Privatize Airport Security Screening BRAMPTON – Today, the NDP is calling on Justin Trudeau’s Liberals to stop the privatization of Canadian Airport Transportation Security Authority (CATSA) behind closed doors and without worker representatives. Workers’ knowledge and years of experience absolutely need to be taken into account before government makes major modifications. “This government has chosen to ignore stakeholders and instead rely on the biased opinions of those they hire to justify privatization. This consultation process has not been open or transparent. It is shameful that workers and their representatives have not been included at all stages of this transition. The knowledge and expertise CATSA workers and their representatives have is crucial to protecting public interest and public money,” said NDP candidate Saranjit Singh (Brampton East). Not only would privatization result in higher ticket prices and erode safety standards, it would also have major impacts on workers. The Liberals show a complete lack of understanding about the effects these changes will have for workers and the traveling public. “Trudeau needs to give assurance that privatization of services will not impact the cost of travel for Canadians as well of the quality of security services,” said Stan Pickthall, General Vice-President of IAMAW. “Time and time again, we have seen Trudeau favouring the interests of big businesses and trading them for the interests of ordinary Canadians. The Liberals are working in coordination with Scheer’s Conservatives to ensure worker’s input is bypassed. Let’s make sure this will not happen again.” The NDP believes that CATSA’s funding model should be reviewed to make it stable and predictable to ensure that international standards are met. A New Democrat government commits to review the Liberals’ decision and make sure to put the interest of workers and Canadians first. – 30 – Facts: From January to July, 2019, 29.4 million passengers passed through Canada’s busiest hub, Toronto Pearson International Airport, an increase from last year.
A boom in the airlines industry will bring more passengers at every Canadian airport, which requires not just efficiency but also meeting strict safety standards that protect the traveling public.
During the budgetary process, New Democrats tried to stop the privatization of CATSA to avoid costs being passed on to the public, erosion of safety and working conditions of airport workers.

Today, Justin Trudeau, once again, showed whose side he’s on by appointing a senior person in the banking sector, Tony Loffreda, to the Senate. It’s simple: his priority is working for the richest, not for the rest of us.
		In his former job, Trudeau’s new Senator focused on “high net worth” and “affluent” individuals such as corporate executives, heirs, and Canada’s richest families, to help them to pay as little tax as possible. The richest are already well represented in the Senate and after a report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer concluded that big corporations and the richest are avoiding paying more than $25 billion a year in taxes, it has become clear that Canadians need legislators that will fight to make the richest pay their fair share so we can invest in services people rely on and in programs that improve all of our lives.
		Appointing a new Senator in the dead of summer, before an election, is a sign the Prime Minister sees this as a way to help the richest and big corporations, rather than something he is proud to advertise to Canadians.
		Compared to Justin Trudeau, our New Deal for People is taking Canadians’ needs seriously by making the richest pay their fair share to make life for working people and families more affordable and to fight the climate crisis.

NDP Will Help Communities Adapt to Climate Change GATINEAU – Today, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh underlined the Liberals’ failure to address the climate emergency, saying that Justin Trudeau chose to protect corporate interests above the wellbeing of Canadians. “Too many Canadians are dealing with disasters like flooding that destroy their homes and disrupt their lives. Justin Trudeau says he agrees there is a climate crisis, but he doesn’t seem to get it. He’s spent billions on a pipeline, while under-funding support for communities impacted by disasters like flooding,” says Singh. “We can do better for people. We have a bold climate plan that replaces pretty words with real action.” In 2015, the Conservative government raised the threshold for provinces to qualify for federal compensation for disasters – and the Trudeau Liberals not only kept this change but also purchased the Trans-Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion, while leaving communities scrambling for funding to fight flooding and forest fires. “The Liberals promise one thing during election, and deliver another in government. While families here in Gatineau and across the country struggle with the growing threat of floods and other climate-related disasters, Justin Trudeau was more focused on buying a pipeline than on getting them help,” added Singh. “We’re going to make different choices. We have a plan to help communities protect people from the impacts of climate change right now.” New Democrats have a real plan to confront the climate crisis and limit warming to 1.5 degrees. The NDP would expand federal funding by $2.5 billion to help communities respond to disasters and adapt infrastructure to withstand floods and other extreme weather events.

Jagmeet Singh Wants Waterfront Property Sale Stopped Singh in Toronto fighting for more affordable housing. TORONTO – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP Candidate for Spadina—Fort York, Diana Yoon, were at Toronto’s waterfront on Friday calling on Trudeau’s Liberals to halt the sale of prime federally owned land for the construction of luxury condominiums. The land, says Singh, should be used to help ease the affordable missing-middle housing crunch instead. “Too many people in Toronto are struggling every month with the cost of housing,” said Singh. “They’re stuck in a place that’s too expensive, overcrowded, or even unsafe — and can’t find or can’t afford a decent home to move their families into. Trudeau’s Liberals give lip service to the housing crisis, then turn around and sell this federal property to developers to build expensive fancy condominiums for the richest of the rich. Trudeau has a little piece of the solution in his hands — and he’s handing it over to developers.” The 1.2-acre site at 200 Queens Quay West, across from the Harbourfront Centre, is now being marketed by Canada Lands Company for private residential development. The Crown Corporation says that the site has the “potential to support a landmark two-tower development featuring a 55- and 45-storey tower above a 10-storey podium.” There will be no requirement that the development include any affordable housing. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 households are on the social housing waiting list in Toronto — more people waiting than are living in the available affordable homes. ""Torontonians are feeling squeezed by the high cost of housing - even as we work harder and harder to pay rent and survive in an increasingly unaffordable city,"" said Yoon. “Justin Trudeau and the Liberals talk a good game about housing, but as soon as the microphones are off, Trudeau does what’s best for the developers instead of doing what’s best for our community.” The NDP’s New Deal for People commits to create 500,000 units of quality, affordable housing in the next 10 years, with half of that done within five years. Working in partnership with provinces and municipalities, the New Deal will build capacity for social, community, and affordable housing providers and co-ops, prioritize affordable housing when federal lands are sold, and help meet bold environmental and energy efficiency goals.This is the body of this article.

Liberals Should be Evicted for Phony Housing Promises Justin Trudeau likes to talk about housing. But the Parliamentary Budget Officer recently revealed that Justin Trudeau’s housing plan spends less as a percentage of GDP than the ten previous years under Stephen Harper, prompting Liberal housing lead Adam Vaughn to attack the independent PBO. Earlier this year, Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan got caught when they “double counted to rhetorical advantage” on the number of housing units they built. The Liberals didn’t mention “rent” once in their 2015 platform, and haven’t done anything to help renters during their four years in government. Nearly one in five Canadians spends more than 50% of their income on rent and utilities. The PBO also found that Trudeau’s government sent an additional $100 million to Ontario for housing programs, but allowed Doug Ford to cut funding for housing programs by $161 million, scrap rent control and slash funding to fight homelessness. On housing, Canadians can’t trust Justin Trudeau’s phony promises. ",2019-09-26

NDP Will Bring Better Health Care to Brampton NDP commits to partner with provinces to tackle access to health care
		BRAMPTON – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and the NDP's Team Brampton joined together to highlight the urgent need for better health services in Brampton, and committed to investing in health care and working with the city and the province to get a new hospital built. “When people go to the only hospital in the Brampton region, they wait and wait in pain — only to be moved onto a stretcher or a chair in a hallway,” said Singh. “For years, Liberal and Conservative governments have squeezed health care funding while demand is going up. New Democrats are different – we’re ready to invest in the health services people need, here in Brampton and all across the country.” People in Brampton currently live with some of the worst hospital overcrowding in Canada. The NDP's New Deal for People commits to tackling health care wait times and expanding access to health care, as well as no-cost access to prescription drugs with national pharmacare. “When we make the investments in health services like pharmacare, people can stay healthy and save the system money. No one should have to be in a $1,500 a day hospital bed because they couldn’t afford a $5 pill. We can bring in pharmacare and expand health services, if we have the courage to make different choices. Liberal MPs here have let people down – New Democrats will stand with families in Brampton to make sure they get the care they need,” added Singh. NDP Candidates Saranjit Singh (Brampton East), Mandeep Kaur (Brampton South), Jordan Boswell (Brampton Centre), Melissa Edwards (Brampton North) and Navjit Kaur (Brampton West) joined Singh for the announcement.

Singh Will Tax Multimillionaires to Fund Health Care HAMILTON – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is meeting with Canadians struggling with cuts to important services they rely on and the growing cost of health care expenses. Singh is proposing a tax on those with fortunes above $20 million to make sure hardworking Canadians get the services they need like pharmacare and head-to-toe health care. “New Democrats have the courage to make different choices. Unlike the Liberals and Conservatives who work for their rich and powerful friends, we will help people who are struggling to get by,” said Singh. “Our plan is simple – we can afford to help people when we have the courage to ask the super-rich to pay a little bit more to fund the services we all rely on.” For years, Liberals and Conservatives have been helping their corporate friends and the very richest to avoid taxes and hide billions offshore every year. New Democrats will bring in a tax on the multimillionaires alongside tougher enforcement to stop tax evasion both in Canada, and off-shore. “Families shouldn’t have to worry about their future. They deserve a government that is actually on their side. Canadians deserve prescription drugs covered by Medicare, and expanded health care services to cover people head-to-toe – and we can do this when the very richest pay their fair share,” concluded Singh. – 30 – Facts: The NDP’s super-wealth tax would apply a 1% tax on fortunes above $20 million.
This will be applied annually and include real estate, luxury items and investments.
This tax will apply to only the very wealthiest one tenth of one percent of Canadian households.
Over ten years, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates that this tax will raise almost $70 billion, starting with $5.6 billion in 2020-21 and growing to $9.5 billion by 2028-29.
It will be paired with boosted enforcement against tax evasion and penalties for millionaires who try to evade paying taxes, including regular CRA audits and third-party valuation of assets.
In June 2019, the Parliamentary Budget Officer found that Canada is losing up to $25 billion in tax revenues to overseas tax evasion by multinational corporations. ",2019-09-10

As it is proposed, his plan will contribute to the increase of GHG emissions in the country. Worse still, it will cost the majority of citizens nearly $300 out of pocket by 2022. Climate change is already costing Canadians dearly. We are already spending billions of dollars responding to the horrific consequences of wildfires, floods, heatwaves, and air pollution across the country. And now, Andrew Scheer is proposing to increase that bill? He has a lot of nerve. The countdown has begun: we only have 11 years to avoid the worst case scenario. The only path forward for the county is to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions – not to increase them, as proposed by the Conservative leader. Unlike the Conservatives, we have a concrete plan for an energy transition that reduces greenhouse gas emissions while making sure that workers are protected.” ",2019-07-11

Liberal Platform Fails On Child Care NDP commits to 500,000 more affordable spaces VANCOUVER – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh committed to delivering universal child care by 2030 and underscored the broken promises by Justin Trudeau’s Liberals that have failed everyday families. “Yesterday we saw more empty Liberal promises. Justin Trudeau is walking away from families who urgently need help and telling them they need to settle for less,” said Singh. “Four years after Justin Trudeau promised high-quality affordable child care for ‘all families that need it’ – there aren’t any child care spaces for three quarters of kids under six. This is wrong.” A New Democrat government will establish a universal child care and early learning system by 2030, beginning with a $10 billion investment over four years to create more than 500,000 new licensed child care spaces in partnership with provinces, territories and Indigenous governments. Parents in British Columbia have called the provincial NDP government’s $10 a day child care pilot program ‘life changing’. Our commitment will build on this success. The NDP will bring in legislation to enshrine our commitment to quality, affordable publicly funded child care, to set up a national child care secretariat to oversee the coordination of the work, and to collaborate with the provinces and territories on initiatives such as a workforce strategy and improved data sharing and research. “Liberals promised child care twenty-six years ago. The children who were born the year the Liberals first promised a national child care plan are now looking for child care for their own kids!"" said Singh. ""You can’t be a feminist if you fail to deliver on child care – period. New Democrats will fight for affordable child care for families.""

A New Deal to Help Toronto Families with Flooding TORONTO – On Tuesday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh along with NDP candidate for York South – Weston Yafet Tewelde visited the Black Creek Channel and homes in the area impacted by flooding. Singh announced his plan to help families and the city of Toronto deal with climate change impacts and flooding. “When it comes to tackling the climate emergency, Justin Trudeau’s actions don’t match his sales pitch. The consequences of governments failing to act to fight climate change are very real for the people of York South – Weston. The costs and consequences of floods in this community have resulted in hundreds of millions in damage,” said Singh. “People deserve better. In upgrading our infrastructure, we can help people in York South – Weston be better prepared for floods.” Jagmeet Singh and the NDP’s New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs is designed to win the battle against the climate crisis. In Toronto, especially in York South – Weston, the streets, pipes, bridges, tunnels – everything has been built hundreds of years ago and is designed for the wrong climate. A New Democrat government will expand federal funding by $2.5 billion to respond to disasters and support communities like York South – Weston to adapt their infrastructure to withstand floods and other extreme weather events. “Families paid up to $30,000 out of pocket to clean up their homes after a flood, and now fear that insurance companies won’t cover them. Liberal and Conservative governments have failed to upgrade infrastructure in York South – Weston,” added Tewelde. “Our plan will take water away from your home, protect your biggest asset and help you avoid paying thousands of dollars to restore your basement after a flood. It’s time for families in Toronto to have someone in their corner. The NDP has a plan to help.” ""In recent years, basements in our neighbourhood have flooded multiple times because of rising water levels in the Black Creek Channel. My home was badly flooded last summer. The infrastructure in our neighbourhood can't keep up and I fear the constant financial burden this puts on our families,” said Lloyd Kerr, homeowner. “I am excited that Jagmeet and the NDP have put forward a plan to support communities like ours improve our infrastructure to withstand flooding and protect our homes.""

Together, all parliamentarians agreed to seek justice for all families, survivors and victims of violence and war in Sri Lanka. “I’m proud that our second attempt to pass this important motion was passed successfully in the House by all MPs. It was important for us to try again to make sure we do what is right for the community,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “I understand the legacy of genocidal acts. The trauma and loss of life. The impact of a missing generation – where thousands of innocent women, children, and men were extrajudicially murdered and disappeared during 30 years of war in Sri Lanka. As elected Leaders in this country, we have a role to confront human rights violations, challenge persecution, and do everything we can to ensure that these atrocities never happen again.” Here is the official text of the motion tabled by NDP Human Rights Critic Cheryl Hardcastle: That the House: a) extend its condolences to all the victims of violence and war in Sri Lanka; b) call on the Government of Sri Lanka to promote justice for those affected by the Easter Sunday attacks, protect the rights of religious minorities, and defend all places of worship; c) reaffirm Canada’s call for Sri Lanka to implement its obligations within a clearly specified time frame, as mandated under the UN Human Rights Council Resolutions 30/1 and 40/1; and re-affirms Canada’s support in advancing accountability, peace, and reconciliation among all peoples on the island; and d) call upon the United Nations to establish an international, independent investigation into allegations of genocide against Tamils committed in Sri Lanka, including the last phase of the armed conflict in 2009. “It is an honour to have been part of this important moment for the community. We are building on the work of Jack Layton who has been a strong ally for the Canadian Tamil community for a number of years,” added Hardcastle. “To all Tamil Canadians, we want you to know that you have in the NDP, an ally that will always stand with you in your peaceful pursuit of truth and justice.

Jagmeet Singh Lays Out Economic Vision to Help Young People and Families Singh delivers message on tax fairness and wealth inequality at Canadian Club TORONTO – Jagmeet Singh delivered a message on his economic vision to a lunchtime audience in Toronto today that if New Democrats are elected, people at the top will have to pay a little more. “We are not going to shy away from speaking up for everyday people – and standing up to the wealthy and well-connected,” said Singh. “The stakes are high. If we do not change the path we are on, we are putting the very idea of Canada – that everyone should get the help they need to have an equal chance to succeed - at risk.” In his speech before the 120-year-old Canadian Club, Singh made the case that despite the economy doing well over the past four years, families – and young people in particular – are struggling to pay their bills each month. Meanwhile, two Canadian men now have as much wealth as the bottom 30% of all Canadians combined. Over the last few decades, the tax burden in Canada has fallen more and more onto families - while big corporations and super-wealthy Canadians pay less. Earlier this week, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP laid out an election commitment to bring in a 1% super-wealth tax on households with a net wealth of more than $20 million. The Parliamentary Budget Office has estimated that this measure could bring in $70 billion in new revenue. “Young people are struggling to pay sky-high bills for rent, tuition, student loans, cell phones and so much more. It’s time we fixed a system that is rigged against them,” said Singh. ""We believe middle- and low-income Canadians are paying their fair share. We will not raise taxes on everyday people.

But whether I am Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition or holding the balance of power, this is what the NDP will ensure the next government delivers for people.” Highlighting reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples — from clean water to equity in services — as a foundation for all government actions, Singh shared his priorities. A national universal pharmacare plan and a national dental care plan, delivering affordability and better health to Canadians.
A home people can afford, including massive investments in housing, real action on money laundering and a tax on foreign speculators.
Beginning to tackle student debt, by taking all interest off of student loans, current and future.
A bold plan and concrete action to fight the climate crisis, ending the subsidies to big oil companies, committing to science-based targets and helping workers during the transition from fossil fuels.
Making cell phone and internet bills more affordable by putting in place a price cap to make sure that Canadians aren’t paying more than the global average for their cell phone and internet bills.
Ensuring the super-wealthy are paying their fair share by introducing a super wealth tax, closing tax loopholes, and ending giveaways for the richest companies and individuals. “We can and must change the way Canadians choose their government, so that people feel they can vote for what they believe, not against what they fear,” said Singh. “We can change the system so that every vote counts no matter where you live. And so that Liberals or Conservatives can never ignore you again. We can ensure that the next government changes the system, so it works for you by delivering real electoral reform, proportional representation, to stop the revolving door of bad and worse.” While Singh works towards an NDP victory on Oct. 21, should voters choose a minority government, he has completely ruled out propping up an Andrew Scheer Conservative government.

Study Shows How Trudeau’s Abandoned Pharmacare Promise Will Hurt People A study done by the St. Michael’s Hospital’s MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions shows that providing universal pharmacare will make life significantly more affordable for people. It found that covering the cost of prescription drugs causes a large increase – from 33% to 86% – in people’s ability to ""make ends meet"" or afford basic necessities such as food and rent, showing that for many people, medicine costs are the difference between paying the bills or not. Meanwhile, experts agree that Justin Trudeau has abandoned his pharmacare promise. Former Liberal Health Minister Jane Philpott says it falls “far short” of what is required. It’s been 22 years since the Liberals first rolled out their pharmacare promise. And this campaign, just six days after telling Canadians he would bring in pharmacare, Justin Trudeau completely abandoned Canadians struggling with the cost of prescription drugs.

But just 11 days ago at the Toronto Star editorial board, Justin Trudeau dodged repeated questions from journalists on his refusal to commit to a national affordable child care program. When asked why the Liberal government wasn’t taking action on child care, Trudeau passed the buck to provincial governments: “We can’t take on things that fundamentally it’s been shown, can be ably led, and should be ably led by the provinces.” (Video) This is a sharp departure from his 2015 commitment to “to deliver affordable, high-quality, flexible, and fully inclusive child care for Canadian families.” As Child Care Now pointed out, Liberals fell far short of their 2015 promise. (1) Even Liberal MP Wayne Long recently described child care costs as a “crisis situation” and a recent study by the Canadian Centre for Policy alternatives found that child care fees have risen faster than inflation in 61% of Canadian cities. (2) NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Families shouldn’t have to choose between having kids and having a career. Justin Trudeau said he would make child care affordable, but he broke that promise. Just a few days ago, Justin Trudeau was telling Canadians that child care was a provincial responsibility. It’s clear that people who are struggling with high child care costs can’t trust Justin Trudeau’s pretty words and empty promises.” ",2019-09-16

Liberals Need to Assure Canadians Medication Supply Thrives in Canada VANCOUVER – Following news reports that the Trump administration will allow prescription drugs to be imported from Canada to the United States, NDP Health Critic Don Davies wrote a letter to the Liberal Minister of Health, Ginette Petitpas Taylor asking her to reveal what her government will do to make sure the medication Canadians need is not depleted as a result. “I have heard from many patients and health care providers who are rightly alarmed about the prospect of serious shortages in the medications Canadians need, particularly at a time when drug prices are spiralling out of control due to decades of inaction from the federal government, and when millions of Canadians have no drug insurance due to the lack of a national pharmacare program,” wrote Davies. Experts have expressed their deep concern that Canadians may not have an adequate supply of prescription drugs due to this unprecedented step by the White House. This has the potential to impact hundreds if not thousands of prescription drugs, many of which are essential for the preservation of life. “I call on you, as the Minister of Health, to immediately reveal to Canadians what specific steps your government will take to ensure that all Canadians have confidence that the medication they need is not depleted as a result of this sudden decision from the White House,” added Davies.

Dr. Jane Philpott Gives Liberals Bleak Prognosis for Pharmacare Plan Canadians know they can’t trust Justin Trudeau and the Liberals to deliver on pharmacare – and former Liberal Health Minister Dr. Jane Philpott is the latest to add her voice to the chorus casting doubt on Justin Trudeau’s latest promise. In an interview this afternoon, Dr. Philpott said: “I think the concern about this morning's announcement is the ambiguity that's associated with it. There are no timelines in terms of implementation. We don't want four years of negotiations to take place, we want implementation and people need to know, in fact is pharmacare going to be implemented or not?” (CTV Power Play) She continued: “Voters have a right to know, if they vote for Liberals, are they going to have a national single-payer universal public pharmacare system, or not?” Given the fact that the Liberals have been promising and failing to bring in pharmacare since 1997, Canadians can only assume the answer is no. Jagmeet Singh and the New Democrats have a real plan to deliver universal pharmacare for all Canadians in 2020 that will save people money and ensure everyone has access to the prescription drugs they need.

NDP Statement on Federal Court Decision on “Product of Israel” Labels NDP International Trade Critic, Tracey Ramsey, issued the following statement: “This week, the Federal Court ordered the removal of “product of Israel” labels from wines made in the West Bank, in the occupied Palestinian territories. Such labels, the Court ruled, are “false, misleading and deceptive,” and therefore violate Canada’s consumer protection and food and drugs laws. New Democrats welcome this decision, which we view as a step forward for justice in Israel and Palestine. During the debate on Bill C-85, the bill that amends the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement’s implementation law, Trudeau’s Liberals chose to ignore what New Democrats clearly pointed out: the agreement covered products made in Israeli settlements and occupied territories. Liberals deliberately overlooked the fact that neither Canada nor the United Nations recognize these settlements as part of Israel. These settlements are illegal and clearly violate the fourth Geneva Convention. In light of the Federal Court’s decision, we call on Trudeau’s Liberals to amend its laws, policies and practices to ensure full compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 (2016), which calls on all States to “distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.” Products made in illegal settlements that are imported into Canada with “Product of Israel” labels fly in the face of the Government of Canada’s policy on the status of Palestinian territory as well as international law. In fact, the European Union introduced guidelines in 2015 for the labelling of products originating from territories occupied by Israel since June 1967. It’s time for Canada to respect human rights and international law. New Democrats believe that Canada must always have a strong and principled foreign policy, including when it comes to international trade agreements, that is based on human rights and international law. The NDP will always stand up for what is right, even when others don’t have the courage to do it.” ",2019-08-02

Trudeau’s Refusal to Act Leads to Closure of Sole Abortion Clinic in Fredericton As Justin Trudeau campaigns on abortion, his refusal to enforce the Canada Health Act has led directly to the closure of New Brunswick’s only freestanding abortion clinic. Clinic 554 announced today that it is closing because of New Brunswick’s refusal to cover the cost of surgical abortion services outside of hospitals - a clear violation of the Canada Health Act. Justin Trudeau has ignored widespread calls to stand up for abortion services in New Brunswick. In Atlantic Canada access to abortions is limited and expensive, forcing some people to travel up to 500 kilometres to access surgical abortion. The essential health care services Clinic 554 include abortions, as well as specialized care for trans people, HIV-positive people, and those dealing with substance use. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau is campaigning on the right to choose, but his refusal to act has actually reduced access to abortion.

Trudeau Propped Up Harper and Backed Billions in Corporate Tax Cuts Lately, Justin Trudeau has been working overtime to convince Canadians he was part of a “progressive opposition” to Stephen Harper. But Trudeau’s record at the time shows he was not so progressive and he didn’t do all that much opposing. In 2009, the Liberals had an opportunity to join with Jack Layton to defeat Stephen Harper’s budget and block billions in corporate giveaways. Trudeau and the Liberals voted for that budget instead, locking in Harper’s corporate tax cut plan from 19.5% in 2008 to 15% in 2012. That cut gave away $55 billion over five years. When Trudeau came to power in 2015, he kept those tax breaks in place. And Just last year he piled on another $14 billion in giveaways. Between 2006 and 2009, the “progressive” Liberals propped up Harper in 79 confidence motions while Jack Layton and the NDP consistently tried to defeat Harper. So while Justin Trudeau claims he “couldn’t” stop Stephen Harper in opposition, perhaps a more honest word is “wouldn’t.” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Again and again, Justin Trudeau has chosen the rich and powerful over people. He gives Canadians pretty words at election time, and then stands up for multimillionaires when he’s behind closed doors. We’ll ensure corporations and the super-rich pay their share so we can make life better and more affordable for everyday Canadians.” ",2019-10-16

The NDP Promises to Expand Health Care Coverage DRUMMONDVILLE – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP MP François Choquette (Drummond) announced the NDP's commitment to expanding Medicare to cover people from head to toe.

It is outdated and reflects the needs of the 1950s,"" said Singh. “Quebecers deserve health care coverage that meets their needs. To make life easier for people, the NDP will implement a health care system that covers us from head to toe.” New Democrats have played a major role in shaping Canada’s public, universal health care system. Unfortunately, it no longer meets the needs of Canadians. Today's system largely reflects the politics of successive Liberal and Conservative governments. The profits of large companies and the interests of the private sector are often prioritized over the services provided to people. Too many everyday people are left to fend for themselves and cannot afford the help they need. ""It makes no sense that some parts of the body are covered and others are not. Neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives have the political will to act for the benefit of people. Realities have changed and we must adapt the health services on offer,"" added Choquette. “What we are proposing today is to expand health care coverage to include dental, eye, hearing, and mental health care. Complete coverage that reflects the needs of 21st century Quebecers!” The NDP is committed to working with the provinces and health professionals to modernize our health care system to meet today's needs.

NDP’s New Deal For B.C. Highlights Affordable Homes, Climate Action Jagmeet Singh takes on money launderers and housing speculation VANCOUVER—More affordable homes and a real plan to fight the climate crisis are at the heart of a New Deal for B.C. unveiled today by NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “When B.C. families asked for help with the out-of-control housing market, Justin Trudeau spent $4.5 billion of their money on a pipeline instead,” said Singh. “Liberals and Conservatives have failed people here for too long. British Columbians deserve a real partner in Ottawa: a New Democrat government that has the courage to do what’s right to make sure that everyone has an affordable place to call home.” While the B.C. government has done the hard work to tackle the housing crisis, Trudeau has failed to do enough on the money laundering and speculation that’s driving up real estate prices. The NDP’s urgent action plan includes a dedicated RCMP unit to fight money laundering and a national registry that prevents companies from hiding who profits from real estate, along with a tax on foreign buyers to address housing speculation. “New Democrats understand the priorities of British Columbians, and we will fight for them,” said Singh. “Working families have paid the price long enough for the pretty words and empty promises. We’ll take real action to make housing more affordable, because we’re in it for you.” The NDP’s plan to make life more affordable for B.C. families includes bringing down the cost of cell phone bills, and bringing in dental care and universal prescription drug coverage. New Democrats will also fight the climate crisis with a bold plan to defend our land, water and coasts, while creating good-paying jobs that families can rely on. – 30 – Facts: In April 2019, B.C.’s expert panel reported that money laundering funded $5.3 billion in real estate purchases and was responsible for increasing housing prices by 5% across the province. [1]
The report found that B.C. didn’t have a single federal RCMP officer dedicated to investigating money laundering.
Currently, it would take the average young person 29 years to save enough money for a down payment on a home in Vancouver. [2]
The NDP’s plan will immediately create a dedicated RCMP anti-money laundering unit – with B.C. as a priority. We will invest $20 million in additional funding each year, half of which will go to B.C., to ensure that dedicated officers work on money laundering.
Building on the leadership of the B.C. government, we would require corporations, trusts and partnerships that currently own or buy land to disclose who owns them by creating a national beneficial ownership registry. Tax authorities, police, and regulators would be able to use the information to crack down on tax evasion, fraud, and money laundering.
We will also bring in a national foreign buyer’s tax to curb speculation that’s fueling high housing prices. The 15% Foreign Buyer’s Tax will apply on the sale of homes to individuals who aren’t Canadian citizens or permanent residents, on top of existing provincial taxes. This will raise an estimated $320 million in the first full year of implementation. ",2019-09-25

NDP Statement on Liberal Appointments in New Brunswick NDP Ethics Critic, Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay), issued the following statement: “Yet again, Trudeau's Liberal government has shown a complete disregard for the impartiality of appointments in Canada. On Tuesday, CBC revealed that five of the last six federal judicial appointments announced in New Brunswick have ties to Dominic LeBlanc, the Minister for Intergovernmental and Northern Affairs and Internal Trade. LeBlanc's neighbour, a LeBlanc family relative, and three lawyers who helped retire debts from LeBlanc's 2008 Liberal leadership bid have all been announced as new federal judges. This level of cronyism is completely unacceptable. To make matters worse, this isn't the first time that this senior Liberal cabinet Minister has broken the rules to help his personal connections. In September, Canada's Ethics Commissioner ruled that LeBlanc broke conflict of interest rules from handing a highly profitable Arctic surf clam licence to a company linked to his wife's cousin. At this rate, it looks like Dominic LeBlanc could teach Doug Ford a lesson on patronage appointments. But it's not just about cronies. We are seeing a disturbing willingess of the Trudeau government to undermine the independence of the judiciary. This interference led to the SNC scandal and the decision by two top Liberal cabinet ministers to quit. The pattern was continued in the leakage of information on the Supreme Court nomination process and the government's policy of vetting judges through a partisan database. Time and time again, the Liberals have shown that they care more about helping their friends and donors than making life easier for everyday Canadians. Canada’s appointments should be chosen based on merit, not whether they know Dominic LeBlanc or took a big red lawn sign during the last election. It is time for this patronage to end.” ",2019-07-02

Cancellation of Bell Service shows Liberal Failure: NDP Liberals are more interested in protecting corporate profits than serving Canadians WINDSOR — Today, NDP Critic for Innovation, Science, and Economic Development, Brian Masse (Windsor West), pointed to Bell Canada’s cancellation of the planned service rollout to 200,000 households as proof that the Liberals are failing to create more competition in the telecom sector to make life more affordable for people. “You can’t have a real plan to deal with telecom affordability and service without the courage to take on the well-connected telecom giants,” stated Masse.  “What’s shocking isn’t that the Liberals’ plan failed, but that it failed in just four days. Bell’s display of corporate greed to save a rounding error in their revenue is leading them to abandon 200,000 underserved Canadian households. Bell’s customers wait on hold longer than it took them to protect their price gouging.” Bell announced this week that it will reduce its broadband Internet build-out for smaller towns and rural communities, abandoning 200,000 households, in response to a CRTC decision that lowered wholesale rates for third-party Internet resellers. “For decades, Conservative and Liberal governments have abandoned Canadian consumers by allowing unfair competition to fester in the telecom market,” said Masse. “The result is that Canadians pay among the highest prices in the world for cellphone and internet service, while those living in rural and remote communities have no service at all. The Liberals’ plan will protect telecom company profits while doing nothing to guarantee Canadians wireless or high-speed internet access.” New Democrats believe that no matter where you live in Canada, you should be able to stay connected – without breaking the bank over unfair gouging. The NPD’s New Deal for People will also save Canadians an average of $10 on every cell and internet bill. ",2019-08-20

Jagmeet’s plan will save young people $1,200 a year on cell phone fees, student debt, dentacare and pharmacare, and up to $5,000 a year on rent. “In 2015, Justin Trudeau made a lot of big promises. But four years later, the wealthiest in Canada are doing better, but things aren’t any easier for young people starting out,” said Singh. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can make different choices to get better results for young people.” Access to education should never depend on how much money your parents make or how much debt you can carry. Barriers to quality, affordable education have been set up by Liberal and Conservative governments – and it’s time to tear them down. New Democrats have a plan for young people to remove all interest from federal student loans – saving a graduate with an average loan approximately $3,400 over ten years. “Justin Trudeau walked away from his promises on pharmacare and electoral reform, but managed to find $14 billion in special tax breaks for his corporate friends. And this election, he’s telling young people to settle for less,” said Singh. “New Democrats are different. We’re in it for you, and we’re ready to make big changes to deliver a better future for young people in every part of Canada.” The NDP’s vision will also fight the climate crisis with a bold plan to defend our land, water and coasts, while creating good-paying jobs that young people can rely on.

NDP Promises Families Relief on Cell Phone and Internet Bills NDP’s plan to cap prices would save Canadian families almost $250 per year TORONTO –  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in Toronto today to announce his plan to protect Canadians from gouging by big telecom companies. Singh is calling for a cap on cell phone and internet prices, which would save families almost $250 a year. “For most Canadians, having a cell phone and high-speed Internet is not a choice — they need these things for school, for work, and to stay connected with family and friends,” said Singh. “And Canadians who are fortunate to have access to reliable service pay some of the highest prices in the developed world. They can’t afford to give these things up, even as rising costs squeeze their budgets.” Liberal and Conservative governments have left Canadians to go at it alone as telecom companies gouge them all while raking in billions of dollars. On Trudeau’s watch, the Big Five telecoms enjoyed profit margins of almost 40 per cent in 2017. To top it off, Trudeau rewarded Bell, Rogers and Telus with $50 million in subsidies and more than $700 million in contracts. “Canadians deserve better than Liberal and Conservative governments that keep making life easier for their corporate friends and harder for everyone else,” said Singh. “I’m ready to fight for everyday people and stand up to rich telecom companies. Our plan to cap prices on cell phone and internet bills is part of our commitment to make life more affordable.” The New Deal for People would also introduce a Telecom Consumers’ Bill of Rights to put an end to the aggressive and misleading sales and services practices of big cell and internet companies. The NDP will require service providers to offer basic plans that meet the needs of Canadians, end caps for internet plans and require companies to offer affordable, unlimited data plans for cellphones – so Canadians don’t have any surprise on their monthly bills. Facts: Among OECD countries and other developed economies, Canadians pay some of the highest prices for mobile wireless and broadband subscriptions.
Similar countries like Australia are sometimes paying 2 times less than Canada for the same plan.
In 2018, the total revenue per gigabyte in Canada was roughly 70 times higher than in India and 23 times higher than in Finland.
Canadian telecoms made 35 times what Indian companies made for the same data usage in 2017. As a result, Canada has lower data use than many other countries.
The NDP price cap will save families on average $10 per month for each bill meaning that a family with two plans will save almost $250 per year. ",2019-09-13

Singh to Trudeau: Why Are You Letting Multimillionaires Off the Hook? Yesterday, Jagmeet Singh challenged Justin Trudeau on why he won't tax the super-rich to pay for services Canadians badly need. Trudeau used to talk about making the rich pay their share. But after four years in power, Canada’s richest 87 families hold as much wealth as 12 million Canadians. Trudeau's 2019 platform includes nothing that asks the richest 1% to pay more, and offers nothing to Canadians who can't afford basic needs like rent and medication. Does Justin Trudeau think that’s fair? Singh said: “We know that Mr. Trudeau is not willing to tax the richest Canadians. We put it to him, and people have asked him, would he be willing to put in place our wealth tax on the super wealthy? He hasn’t said yes.” “No other party is willing to say we’re going to make sure that the richest Canadians, those who have fortunes of over $20 million, pay their fair share. Everyone else, Canadians, hardworking families, middle-class families, they’re paying their fair share. They don’t need to pay any more of the burden. “We’re not going to raise taxes on middle-class and working-class families. But we’re asking the richest to pay their fair share. Mr. Trudeau is not willing to do that.” Singh has made implementing a super-wealth tax on fortunes over $20 million an urgent priority in the next Parliament.

His 2015 platform promised “we will end the cycle of federal parties – of all stripes – setting arbitrary targets without a real federal/provincial/territorial plan in place.” But then the Liberals adopted Stephen Harper’s targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and are on path to meet them 200 years late. After the pressure of big polluters, Justin Trudeau gave them a carbon pricing exemption, delayed the Clean Fuel Standard and methane regulations until after the election. Under Justin Trudeau, Canada continues to spend around $3.3 billion a year on subsidies for big oil and gas companies, produce more greenhouse gas emissions per person than any other G20 economy and warm twice as fast as the rest of the world. The Liberal commitment to introduce legislated targets for emissions reductions could have been implemented more than a decade ago – if the Liberal-dominated Senate hadn’t let Jack Layton’s private member’s bill C-377 The Climate Change Accountability Act die on the order paper. And they blew past the 1997 Kyoto Protocol’s emissions targets by 30%.

The bill would have given non-citizens the ability to bring civil suits to Canadian federal courts for clear violations of Indigenous peoples’ rights, labour, environmental and basic human rights committed outside of Canada. “Canada should be at the forefront of Human Rights enforcement. Bill 331 sends a clear message that citizens who have claims that cannot be heard elsewhere can come to the Canadian courts to have their human right claims heard. It is a tragedy that Parliament declined to send that message today,” said Mark Rowlinson, labour lawyer and Assistant to Steelworkers’ Canadian National Director. Bill C-331 was defeated 238 to 49. It received unanimous support from New Democrat, Bloc Québécois and Green MPs. “Civil society’s remarkable show of support for this bill has been outstanding. I am confident that in the fall, Canadians will elect a Parliament that is going to be far more responsive to Canadians’ priorities, instead of those of wealthy corporations,” stated Julian. “Canada must promote values of respect, social justice, environmental protection and respect for the rights of Indigenous Peoples, labour, environmental and human rights here and abroad.” The bill was endorsed by over 50 national organizations, representing over five million Canadians, who wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister calling on the government of Canada to vote in favour of C-331. These groups included Common Frontiers, Canadian Voice of Women for Peace, National Union of Public and General Employees (NUPGE), the British Columbia Teachers’ Federation, Greenpeace Canada, the Climate Action Network Canada and the Canadian Association of Labour Lawyers. Prominent Canadians supporting the bill include Stephen Lewis, Maude Barlow and Ken Neuman, National Director of United Steelworkers (USW) – Canada. A little over six months ago Justin Trudeau stated that, ‘Canada is unwavering in its commitment to protect and promote human rights. We will not stand idle while hundreds of thousands of people around the world suffer gross human rights violations, nor will we hesitate to condemn violations of human rights, regardless of where they take place...Human rights are universal and fundamental – and so is our responsibility to protect them.’ “Today, the Prime Minister abandoned those words and the hundreds of thousands of people who look to Canada to help alleviate their suffering,” stated Nick Milanovic, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Law at Carleton University, labour lawyer, an arbitrator, and a union member. It is time for the Canadian government to show leadership in facilitating access to Canadian courts for the foreign victims of corporate abuses. The NDP will continue the fight for human & environmental rights in the next Parliament. ",2019-06-19

And since 2013, lobbyists and members of Canada's four largest telecoms companies donated $41,861 to the Liberal Party of Canada.

The NDP Will Fund the Sherbrooke-Montreal Train SHERBROOKE — Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP MP Pierre-Luc Dusseault (Sherbrooke) announced that an NDP government will fund the Sherbrooke-Montreal train project. This promising project will make people's lives more affordable, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, create quality jobs, and stimulate economic development across the region. ""People want to fight climate change and want the tools to be able to do so. I’m committed to making different choices for people. Instead of spending taxpayers' money on an old pipeline, we should be investing in projects like the Sherbrooke train,"" said Singh. “People were misled by Justin Trudeau's Liberals. They are disappointed by his government’s broken promises and its lack of political will. The NDP is ready to act and has the courage to act to face the climate emergency, while making life easier for people.” The project will connect Sherbrooke to Montreal with stops in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Farnham, Bromont, and Magog. A trip will cost about $46 and will take the same time as a car trip, without any traffic. It is estimated that over 2,300 people will use the train daily. This project will create close to 400 quality jobs and reduce our GHG emissions by 10,000 tonnes. “There is no planet B, we must act today. Everyone wins with this public transit project,"" said Dusseault. “Instead of being on the side of Canadians and those trying to protect the environment, Justin Trudeau prefers to give billions in subsidies to the oil and gas industry. The NDP is taking a clear stand to protect the environment! I'm proud that my leader supports this project and has reaffirmed his support for the people of Sherbrooke.” The NDP recently unveiled its plan to fight climate change: Power to change: A New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs. Among other steps, New Democrats are promising greener, more affordable, and more accessible public transit. They are committed to creating at least 300,000 new quality jobs and targeting major polluters.  ",2019-07-16

Liberals Attack Independent Parliamentary Budget Office for Criticizing their Housing Plan In June, the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer said that the Liberal housing plan “largely maintains current funding levels for current activities and slightly reduces targeted funding for households in core housing need… It is not clear that National Housing Strategy will reduce the prevalence of housing need relative to 2017 levels.” (Toronto Star) In fact, the report shows that Trudeau’s spending on affordable housing is 19% less than under Harper’s plan as a percentage of GDP. (PBO, Page 4) Now Adam Vaughan, Justin Trudeau's housing lead, is attacking the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer. But it’s not just the PBO that says the Liberals have fallen short. Housing experts like University of Toronto Professor David Hulchanski agree: “The Liberal Party and even CMHC have mixed all these together into big sounding amounts, as if a great deal is happening. But not much is happening in terms of meeting housing need and existing spending on housing remains at a historically low percentage of the federal budget.” And earlier this year, Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan admitted they “double counted to rhetorical advantage.” Canadian Rental Housing index numbers released yesterday show that in Adam Vaughan's own riding of Spadina Fort York, a median income renter is spending 56% of their paycheck on rent for a 2 bedroom apartment, leaving little behind for necessities like groceries, health care or child care. NDP Candidate Diana Yoon: ""Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan say they will be there for Canadians, but turn around and give tax breaks to their rich friends instead of investing in the housing people need. Now, they’re attacking independent officials to try to cover it up. Jagmeet Singh's New Deal for People would build 500,000 new housing units to make life more affordable for all renters.” ",2019-09-18

Canadians were owed answers. Liberals refused to give Commissioner Dion a chance to explain his report’s findings and take questions.

NDP: Let’s Create Good-Paying, Lasting Local Jobs WELLAND – On Friday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, along with NDP candidate and former MP Malcolm Allen (Niagara Centre), NDP candidate Brian Barker (Niagara Falls) and NDP candidate Denis Van Meer (St. Catharine’s), presented the NDP’s plan to build an advanced low-carbon manufacturing economy to create and maintain good paying jobs in the Niagara region – all while fighting climate change and creating products that save people money. “Manufacturing helped build Canada – and it should continue to build Canada’s future. But as we’ve seen again this week in Thunder Bay, the Liberals and Conservatives’ approach is failing: Canadian manufacturing jobs are disappearing,” said Singh. “New Democrats know that green manufacturing and the good jobs that it creates are vital for so many communities across the country. We are committed to fighting for a strong and robust future for Canadian manufacturing.” In the Niagara region, multiple manufacturing companies working on green products closed shop due to a lack of strategy and investment by the government. The Liberal and Conservative focus on no-strings-attached corporate tax cuts is putting the interests of powerful CEOs and rich shareholders ahead of communities – and it’s led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs over the last two decades. “Niagara Centre is a great place to do business, but too often good green jobs are disappearing because Justin Trudeau has given up on manufacturing – he has even said that the Liberal government is ‘transitioning away from manufacturing-based employment’,” added Allen. “These jobs are important for our community, but are also important for our fight against climate change and in helping families save money. Niagara Centre deserves a government who will fight for manufacturing. We will make different choices for better results.” ""I became interested in working in the green manufacturing industry because I care about the environment but also want a good union job in the trades. I've had difficulty finding work because the job market in the Niagara region is tough. I also have a young daughter I need to support. It's upsetting to see so many companies I could have worked for in green manufacturing that have left the region,” said Thomas McAllister-Dorricott, a young adult in the Niagara region. “I am excited that Jagmeet is putting forward a plan that will help create green manufacturing jobs in Welland and in the rest of the country.""
		Instead of giving handouts to the richest companies, the federal government should be investing in companies that manufacture products to make our municipalities more sustainable and more resilient to the impacts of climate change. This is the way of the future – and it is what New Democrats will deliver. ",2019-07-12

JOHN’S – New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh joined NDP candidate Jack Harris in St. John’s on Tuesday to discuss their bold plan to make everyday life more affordable and services more available for people in Newfoundland and Labrador. “People in St. John’s are worried about the rising cost of living. The Trudeau Liberals have spent years focused on helping out their rich corporate friends, making it harder and harder for regular people to get ahead,” said Singh. “That’s why I’m so proud to have great candidates like Jack Harris standing up for Newfoundland and Labrador in Ottawa. Jack has a proven record of fighting for families, for the health care they need, the jobs and opportunity they deserve, and the affordability to help them get ahead.” Singh is in St. John’s sharing his New Deal for People – a bold plan to make life more affordable all while addressing issues like climate change, expanding quality health care services, and working for meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous communities. The NDP’s New Deal offers 300,000 new jobs across Canada, expands and improves Employment Insurance, and creates a national pharmacare program to cover all Canadians — the first step in the plan to cover dental care and vision care. The New Deal pays for the improvements by having those who have more than $20 million in wealth pay a little more, along with closing tax loopholes for the super-wealthy and mega-corporations. Singh was joined by Harris, NDP candidate for St. John’s East and MP from 2008 to 2015, and former leader of the provincial NDP. “I know that many people are worrying about making ends meet in St. John’s East and want strong representation in Ottawa.

NDP Raises Deep Concerns About Links Between Canadian Company and the Sudan Military Regime RIMOUSKI - Following a recent media report, the NDP’s Foreign Affairs Critic Guy Caron expressed deep concerns with the reported links between a Canadian company, Dickens & Madson, and the Transitional Military Council (TMC) regime in Sudan. The Globe and Mail report raises serious concerns that a Montreal-based company may be in violation of Canadian law, UN sanctions, and other lobbying and corporate responsibility regulations. “These allegations are really serious and deeply concerning. It is the responsibility of Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government to investigate this report as quickly as possible,” said Caron. “It is completely unacceptable that a Canadian company could be complicit of human rights violations and death.” The Globe and Mail story reports that the contract from the Montreal-based company was signed by General Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who is the deputy leader of the TMC and head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, formerly known as the Janjaweed. The RSF recently led the brutal crackdown on peaceful civilian protesters in Khartoum, resulting in the death of over 100 people. This also comes on the eve of Sunday’s planned demonstrations across Sudan calling on the military to hand over power to a civilian leadership, which the Sudanese military has pledged to suppress. “Unfortunately, from Saudi Arabia to Libya, and now in Sudan, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have repeatedly refused to provide proper oversight of Canadian companies abroad and have allowed the interests of Canadian corporations to take priority over human rights and democracy,” added Caron. “It’s time for Canada to match its actions to its rhetoric and ensure Canadian corporations are in full compliance with international law and human rights.” ",2019-06-29

Government Must Respect All Party Committee Recommendation to Avoid Billion Dollar Boondoggle OTTAWA –This week, a Parliamentary Committee called on the government to release critical information about its controversial plan to overhaul the central heating and cooling infrastructure that services some 80 buildings in the National Capital Region. The unanimous recommendation calls on Public Services and Procurement Canada to make public its analysis of the estimated Greenhouse Gas emissions reduction associated with the program so as to “enable its findings to be scrutinized”. “The government says this project will cut emissions and save money, but they’re not willing to show any numbers to prove it,” said Daniel Blaikie, the NDP Vice-Chair of the committee and Critic for Public Services and Procurement. “After financial disasters like the Phoenix pay system, Canadians deserve to know the numbers before the project becomes another boondoggle.” Testimony at committee by the public sector workers who currently run and maintain the system suggests the benefits of this multi-billion dollar investment will be far less than Canadians are being led to believe. “There is overwhelming evidence that when governments hand over these kinds of projects to private interests, they end up being costlier and accountability goes out the window,” said the National President of PSAC Chris Aylward. “The government’s unwillingness to be forthcoming with the details doesn’t give any confidence that this project will be different and public safety could be at risk.” ",2019-06-20

While they're great with symbolic gestures like voting for a climate change emergency, they do the opposite of helping the environment the very next day with the approval of this pipeline expansion,"" said Singh.

Instead of spending more than $10 billion on the expansion of a pipeline, an NDP government will spend that money on green opportunities to build a secure future for generations to come."" The Liberal government's approval of the project ignores criticisms of the project's violation of Indigenous rights and concerns raised over the substantial risks posed to the environment, marine life and coastal communities by increased tanker traffic and possible oil spills. ""Canadians are reeling after voting for a Liberal government that says one thing and does another. Whether it's approving this pipeline, or implementing a carbon tax that doesn't make the biggest polluters pay, this government has completely failed to keep its promise to take action on climate change,"" said Julian (New Westminster--Burnaby). ""We need to throw everything we have at the fight against the climate crisis, and that means setting ambitious targets with measures to hold the government accountable."" ""Justin Trudeau's Liberal government is not going to meet Stephen Harper's weak Paris emissions reduction targets; in fact, experts tell us they're not going to meet them for 200 years. With today's approval of the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, the Liberals are going to be even farther from reaching those targets,"" added Boulerice (Rosemont--La Petite-Patrie). ""How dare this government even call itself green, when in fact it is betraying future generations with their false environmental policies?"" ""Coastal communities are clear in their opposition to this project. It will increase tanker traffic nearly seven-fold and notably increase the risks of oil-spills to our coast and to families living on the coast.

How Justin Trudeau Helped Doug Ford Cut Services At election time, Justin Trudeau likes to talk about fighting Conservatives. But a closer look at his record shows that he actually let Doug Ford cut affordable housing in Ontario. A recent Parliamentary Budget Office report showed that Trudeau left a giant loophole in his National Housing Strategy. The PBO found that because Trudeau didn’t require provincial matching funds to be additional to the province’s current housing spending levels, Doug Ford was actually able to cut housing funding by $161 million this year, despite receiving federal housing money. The PBO wrote:
		“Provinces and territories that already spend more than the federal government on housing could reduce funding for housing programs while still meeting the cost-matching requirements... Ontario’s 2019-20 Main Estimates reduced operating spending on housing programs from $944 million in 2018-19 to $866 million in 2019-20, and capital spending from $302 million to $219 million, despite $0.1 billion in additional funding provided to Ontario by CMHC in 2019-20.” (PBO, June Report) This policy allows the Liberals to talk about increasing affordable housing investments without any guarantee that affordable housing spending will actually go up. So where did Trudeau’s money go? While Ford cut services, he also cancelled a surtax on the rich, saving the highest-earning Ontarians $275 million a year. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau likes to talk about how bad Conservatives are, but he’s chosen to let Doug Ford cut services for people and give tax breaks to the rich. People can’t afford four more years of Justin Trudeau’s empty promises. I’ll fight hard to stop Conservative cuts all the time, not just during an election campaign.” ",2019-10-03

Trudeau Refuses to Take on Conservative Premiers on Child Care This morning at the Toronto Star editorial board, Justin Trudeau dodged repeated questions from journalists on his refusal to commit to a national affordable child care program. When asked why the Liberal government wasn’t taking action on child care, Trudeau passed the buck to provincial governments: “We can’t take on things that fundamentally it’s been shown, can be ably led, and should be ably led by the provinces.” (Video) Journalists pressed Trudeau on the “double standard” of promising to take action on pharmacare (a provincial responsibility) while refusing to push the provinces on child care. Trudeau refused to directly answer the question. Trudeau’s decision to pass the buck to the provinces is a sharp departure from his 2015 commitment to “to deliver affordable, high-quality, flexible, and fully inclusive child care for Canadian families.” As Child Care Now pointed out, Liberals have objectively not even tried to respect their promise. (1) But as Trudeau refuses to help families with child care costs, even Liberal MP Wayne Long recently described child care costs as a “crisis situation” and a recent study by the Canadian Centre for Policy alternatives found that child care fees have risen faster than inflation in 61% of Canadian cities. (2) An NDP government would invest $1 billion in 2020 and grow that investment annually to reduce child care costs for families. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “At a time when families are struggling with rising child care costs, they need a Prime Minister who isn’t afraid to take on Doug Ford and other conservatives. Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau is showing that despite his nice words, he’s refusing to actually stand up for Canadians struggling with the cost of living. It’s time for a government that is willing to show real leadership to make life better for people. Families should not have to choose between having kids and having a career.” ",2019-09-05

Instead of showing real leadership on serious issues Torontonians are facing, Trudeau was quick to blame Ontario Premier Doug Ford. Torontonians deserve a government that doesn't wait until a federal election campaign to talk about the issues they deal with every day - affordable housing, health care services, and safe cities. ""We know the root causes for violence in our communities - they include poverty, racial discrimination, huge gaps in mental health services, the lack of adequate and affordable housing and the lack of meaningful, good quality job opportunities for young people,"" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wrote to Trudeau in 2018. ""We must strike a new path, one that engages all communities in a united effort to tackle gun violence at its roots. We must replace simplistic solutions with comprehensive, well-informed strategies built out of partnership with those most affected."" In a press conference with the Prime Minister, Toronto Mayor John Tory drew attention to the lack of federal investment in kids, families, and neighbourhoods and explained how with the lack of federal resources, Toronto needs to do more to address violence over the long term. ""Mayor Tory is right to call attention to the lack of leadership from the federal government,"" said the NDP candidate for Davenport, Andrew Cash.

“It Seemed Like a Punt” and Other Things People Are Saying on Trudeau’s Phony Pharmacare Promise Justin Trudeau’s pharmacare PR exercise has been widely panned by experts and political commentators. The promise had no timelines and funding fell far short of what would be needed for a real pharmacare program. Canadians know that the Liberals can’t be trusted to bring in pharmacare – they’ve been promising to introduce pharmacare since 1997. After the election, it never materializes. Here’s what people are saying about the Liberal promise: “It seemed like it was a punt on the pharmacare program. Whether they'll announce more, that's what we're waiting for.” (Hannah Thibedeau, CBC News) “I think the Liberals are lacking a lot of details as to how and when they would do it and exactly how much it would cost. This $6 billion for all these different things would be a drop in the bucket.” (Hannah Thibedeau, CBC News) “He did not release a costing for the proposed plan, nor did he say when it would be implemented.” (Globe and Mail) “The concern about this morning's announcement is the ambiguity that's associated with it. There are no timelines in terms of implementation. We don't want four years of negotiations to take place, we want implementation and people need to know, in fact is pharmacare going to be implemented or not?” (Jane Philpott on CTV) “There’s a real concern around the dollar figure attached to this… they certainly fall short of what both the Hoskins report recommended and what the Parliamentary Budget Officer has recommended.” (Jane Philpott on CTV) “Today’s announcement contains no additional commitments or implementation details…. [Canadians] deserve to know how the party that set the process in motion plans to deliver on its promise.” (Canadian Doctors for Medicare) “When it came to pharmacare, they let a lot slide off the table. If Mr. Trudeau was promising a universal plan, that would be a big deal. But is he? It wasn’t clear that he was.” (Campbell Clark, Globe and Mail) ",2019-09-24

NDP Reacts to Green Party's SNC Privatization Plan for First Nation Water Charlie Angus, NDP Critic for Ethics and Indigenous Youth, issued the following statement: ""Guaranteeing the right to clean water for First Nation families is one of the fundamental moral challenges facing this nation. Therefore I was appalled and disappointed to learn that Elizabeth May's Green Party is proposing to use this crisis as an opportunity to turn over water infrastructure contracts on reserve to SNC-Lavalin who are presently facing serious charges of international corruption. As we speak, my colleagues and I are working alongside Indigenous leaders to fight for the right of safe water in communities like Attawapiskat and Grassy Narrows. I’ve seen first hand the devastating impacts on children and elders who are sick because they’ve been treated like third-class citizens by the federal government. And yet, I have never met with a community who thought privatizing water systems to the benefit of large corporations was the answer. They want and expect what every other Canadian takes for granted - the right to properly funded water and sewage systems. Elizabeth May's proposal is not helpful. We are dealing with the systematic failure of Liberal and Conservative governments to live up to their moral, fiduciary and treaty obligations. This is not a time to experiment with privatizing water services. It is especially not the time for the Green Party to use this crisis as a chance to promote an international corporation facing corporate corruption and bribery charges. What kind of message does that send to Indigenous communities about the value of reconciliation? New Democrats will continue to work with, and listen to, First Nation communities and leaders. Together we fight for the principle that every citizen in this country - Indigenous and non-Indigenous - deserves access to clean, safe water coming out of their tap thanks to proper investments in public infrastructure. Let’s focus on the real issue. The federal government needs to step up with the investments needed to ensure clean water and lift all drinking water advisories for good - and New Democrats won’t stop until the job is done.""

NDP: People Need Expungement, Pardons Not Enough Matthew Green, NDP candidate for Hamilton Centre, made the following statement: “Justin Trudeau's Liberals had plenty of time to get this right and we are disappointed with their decision to only offer pardons for cannabis possession through an application process. This is not enough. New Democrats continue to call for the automatic expungement of records for simple cannabis possession. Possession charges affect a disproportionate number of racialized and other marginalized Canadians. In Regina, Indigenous people were almost nine times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than white people. In Halifax, Black people were five times more likely to get arrested for cannabis possession than white people. The Liberal plan requires people to apply for a record suspension and, even after getting one, suspended records can be revoked and still have significant negative impacts on Canadians. Canadians have agreed: simple possession of cannabis is not a crime. The NDP’s Murray Rankin tabled a bill that would erase these records, and the Liberals rejected it, showing they aren’t actually worried about the disproportionate number of people of color whose lives are being haunted by a simple cannabis possession charge. The NDP is going to keep fighting for criminal records for Canadians convicted of minor cannabis possession to be expunged. Cannabis is legal, and having been in possession of a small amount of it should not impact your job, or your ability to travel.” ",2019-08-01

Justin Trudeau’s Tax Avoidance Hypocrisy This morning, Justin Trudeau attacked Andrew Scheer for planning a tax break for people who use numbered companies to protect their income. Trudeau said Scheer is “planning to give a tax break, larger than the average person makes in a year, for people who are using private corporations to hide, to protect their income.” Meanwhile, he’s refusing to crack down on multimillionaires using offshore tax havens to avoid Canadian taxes. In June, the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that Canada was losing up to $25 billion in revenue every year because corporations were doing business in Canada then transferring money to known tax havens to be taxed at a lower rate. $25 billion represents $675 in lost revenue for every Canadian. Two years ago, the Paradise Papers revealed that Justin Trudeau’s close friend and chief fundraiser Stephen Bronfman was linked to a $60 million offshore trust in the Cayman Islands which may have cost Canada millions in lost revenue. Former Liberal Prime Ministers Jean Chretien and Paul Martin were also linked to offshore tax havens. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “If Justin Trudeau meant a word he said, he’d be taking action to crack down on tax havens. Instead, he’s chosen to protect wealthy Liberal insiders and make Canadians pay the price. It’s time for real action to ensure multimillionaires pay their share so we can invest in services like pharmacare and dentacare to make life better for Canadians.” ",2019-10-06

5 times Justin Trudeau Tried to Cover his Tracks on the SNC-Lavalin Scandal Justin Trudeau has been found guilty twice of breaking Canada’s conflict of interest law – the first time for accepting an all-expenses-paid Caribbean vacation from a billionaire, and the second time for trying to get SNC-Lavalin off the hook for serious corporate corruption criminal charges. Here are 5 times Justin Trudeau tried cover his tracks: 
Blocking testimony at the Justice Committee. After the NDP called for an investigation at the Justice Committee into Justin Trudeau’s alleged political interference in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, the Liberals voted against a motion to investigate. They voted instead for their own, weaker motion – but they couldn’t stop former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould’s explosive testimony. After that, they shut the investigation down.
 
The NDP’s call for a Public Inquiry. After the Liberals axed the Justice Committee, the NDP called for a vote on a public inquiry in the House of Commons. In a close vote that saw some Liberals break ranks, they voted it down.
 
Blocking the Ethics Commissioner’s investigation. While the Ethics Commissioner was investigating (at the request of the NDP), the Liberals refused to give documents and critical testimony protected by refusing to waive Cabinet confidentiality. The Commissioner noted in his final report that he felt his investigation was blocked.
 
Blocking the Ethics Commissioner’s public testimony. After the Commissioner released his stinging report, NDP MPs pushed to hear directly from him at the Ethics Committee. With the Commissioner ready to appear, the Liberals shut down the meeting instead of hearing directly from him about his explosive finding of guilt.
 
Refusing to waive confidentiality for the RCMP. Hours before this election campaign began, we learned that the RCMP had interviewed the Liberals in connection with the SNC-Lavalin scandal – but were barred by Cabinet confidence from getting certain critical information.

Red Flags on Sidewalk Labs Should Halt Project: NDP OTTAWA – On Tuesday, NDP Vice Chair of the Parliamentary Ethics Committee, Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay), raised concerns over the Toronto Sidewalk Labs deal. The evidence gathered in recent parliamentary hearings has raised serious questions about the public benefit of this project. In a supplemental report to the committee’s report on privacy and digital government issued yesterday focusing on the controversial Sidewalk Toronto project, Angus says this project should be halted. “We are talking about an unprecedented extension of surveillance capitalism into the public and private spaces of Canada's largest city,” said Angus. “The proponents have not done credible work of responding to the tremendous concerns raised by both international data experts and the Ontario Auditor General.” “The development of public space requires a much greater level of public input,” said NDP candidate for Davenport, Andrew Cash. “Sidewalk Toronto is also a risky experiment in turning over public urban space to a huge corporation that hasn’t shown it can be trusted to respect people’s privacy and democratic rights.” Sidewalk Labs was selected as Waterfront Toronto’s Innovation and Funding Partner for the Quayside development in October 2017, and the Alphabet subsidiary submitted a draft master plan to Waterfront earlier this week. “Torontonians and Canadians must be skeptical of this project,” said  NDP candidate for Toronto—Danforth, Min Sook Lee. “Canadians have a right to live free from being watched all the time by both the government and the private sector. Smart cities can be good, but a privatizing experiment in surveillance capitalism is not the way forward for Toronto, or for Canada.” “Google has deep pockets and a long memory. They’re not doing this as a charity project, and the business model is constant, total surveillance,” added Angus. ",2019-06-19

NDP MPs Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay) and Tracey Ramsey (Essex) held a public meeting in Attawapiskat and met with hunger strikers Sylvie Metatawabin and Theresa Spence. This is a crisis that can be resolved by a coherent commitment to addressing the infrastructure problems. Angus says they were particularly moved by families whose children are being directly impacted by the chemical contamination in the water. ""We met children who get nose bleeds when they are given a bath,” said Angus. “These children deserve better. Their families are wondering why the Minister is not giving this issue the attention it deserves. ""The problem facing the community is seriously inadequate infrastructure. Even if the water plant is able to produce 100% safe water, the water is undrinkable by the time it reaches the taps in the homes. This is because the whole system requires an overhaul. Ramsey says the inadequate infrastructure is compounding the issues facing the community. ""We have over 300 families without homes,” said Ramsey. “The community can't build new homes because the water system is in such poor state. And the poor state of water is making people sick. This is unconscionable in Canada."" The Liberal government is sitting on a full report outlining the needs and cost of ensuring safe drinking water in Attawapiskat. The price tag is about the same amount of money the Trudeau government gave to Galen Weston to repair his fridges.

Trudeau Refuses to Save New Brunswick’s Only Abortion Clinic Last week, New Brunswick’s only standalone abortion clinic announced that it is closing because of the province’s ongoing refusal to cover the cost of surgical abortion services outside of hospitals - a clear violation of the Canada Health Act.

Now, people in New Brunswick are losing access. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau says he stands up for choice, but he has consistently refused to use his power to protect access to abortion.

A New Democrat government will work with the city of Toronto to deliver funding for affordable housing, better transit, stronger infrastructure, and reliable services to its people. “Municipalities are the fabric of this country, but they’re being asked to do more and more with less and less funding. The federal government must be a better partner to the city of Toronto. Successive Liberal and Conservative governments have failed to massively invest in transit infrastructure and affordable housing and the people in Toronto are paying for it,” said Singh. “To make up for the lack of partnership, municipal governments like Toronto end up having to pick up the slack, stretching their resources to the breaking point. We will make different choices to deliver better results for Torontonians.” During the meeting with Mayor Tory, Singh shared commitments in his New Deal for People that will help the people of Toronto. Singh committed to create half a million units of quality, affordable housing among a host of measures to help people afford to live where they work. To help commuters get to work and fight climate change, the NDP will provide low-cost financing in support of the electrification of transit and other municipal fleets; will create a permanent, direct, allocation-based funding mechanism to modernize and expand public transit in communities like Toronto, and ensure that federal transit funding flows with an emphasis on scaling up low carbon transit projects like zero-emissions buses and electric trains. “New Democrats are strongly and genuinely committed to building a stronger partnership between the federal government and the city of Toronto. Instead of the old Liberal and Conservative approach of prioritizing the richest corporations, we will provide Mayor Tory and municipalities all the tools they need to better serve Canadians,” added Singh. “New Democrats will continue fighting to ensure you receive every single dollar of the funding you were promised.

New Democrats Call for Bolstering Our Economy and Jobs Through Building Fighter Jets in Canada OTTAWA – On Thursday, NDP Defence Critic Randall Garrison called on Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government to use a made in Canada approach to replace Canada’s aging CF-18 fighter jets. New Democrats continue to support a fully open and transparent competition to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging CF-18 fighter jets, but one which encourages bidders to provide the best value for money for Canada. “Purchasing new fighter jets provides us a unique opportunity for getting jets which meet Canadian needs and at the same time help sustain a healthy aerospace industry in Canada. That’s why I am calling on the Government today to set criteria for the upcoming competition that will prioritize the defence of Canadian territory and provide maximum benefits to the Canadian aerospace industry by giving extra weight to bidders willing to build those jets in Canada,” said Garrison. “Any fighter jet must demonstrate the ability to operate throughout Canada’s unique geography, including the Arctic, especially given recent threats to Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic by other major air powers,” added Garrison. “And just as the National Shipbuilding Strategy has bolstered Canada’s domestic shipbuilding industry, the CF-18 replacement jets could be built in Canada, providing much needed jobs in the Canadian aerospace industry in cities like Montreal and Winnipeg.” Successive Conservative and Liberal governments have failed to meet the needs of Canada’s Air Force, with the CF-18s being pushed well past their normal operating life-span. It is questionable whether the Liberal purchase of used Australian fighters will have any significant impact on extending the life of our current fleet. “New Democrats welcome the upcoming competition, even though it remains hard to understand how this Liberal government could have taken four years to get it started,” said Garrison. “While this Liberal government has been dithering, other nations like Denmark have held a competition, selected a jet, and will be taking deliveries long before Canada even gets over the start line.” New Democrats strongly encourage the government to prioritize purchasing fighter jets with Arctic capability while maintaining interoperability with our allies. “Weighing the competition toward a priority on Artic capabilities, and production in Canada shouldn’t exclude any of the likely bidders, especially as two have already indicated building the jets in Canada is feasible,” pointed out Garrison. “Our women and men in uniform deserve the best equipment and supports possible to carry out the difficult and dangerous work we ask of them. This is an opportunity to meaningfully renew the Royal Canadian Air Force and to grow the high-tech manufacturing sector of our economy at the same time.” ",2019-06-27

Oshawa is bracing for the loss of thousands of jobs when vehicle production ends at the local GM plant this year. “Workers should never, ever feel abandoned by their government – but the Liberals and Conservatives have left workers in Oshawa on their own to deal with these devastating job cuts,” said Singh. “New Democrats will always support the auto sector, but we’ll do it with strings attached – jobs need to stay here in Canada.” Oshawa’s story isn’t unique.

The best way Canada can lower the price of drugs is well documented: buying them in bulk using the negotiating power of a 37-million-person single-payer pharmacare plan. But big pharmaceutical and insurance companies don’t want that, so after meeting with them more than 700 times since 2015, Trudeau’s Liberals are stalling pharmacare, and therefore making life easier for big pharma.

I am pleased to see Jagmeet Singh and his team prioritize this important issue in their vision for a better Canada.”

 “Over the last few years, I have become increasingly disheartened by the fact that I am living in a Canada I no longer recognize. The disturbing rise of anti-Black racism, anti-Indigenous racism, Islamophobia, and anti-Semitism, while always a reality within our institutions, seems to have intensified in the public sphere in recent years. The NDP vision document on Confronting Racism gives me hope that we will see a government that is finally ready to admit that we too have a “race problem” and that is committed to addressing it in its many forms – overt and direct and systemic and structural. I want to be able to recognize my Canada again – a Canada that, while not perfect, is determined to get back on track with upholding its core values of equity and justice. As a university professor who works with Black, Indigenous, immigrant and other racially diverse communities, I share the NDP’s stated commitment to ensuring that every Canadian is valued and respected, regardless of their race, culture and ethnic background and that every social institution is equipped and ready to identify, name, and address structurally-embedded forms of racism that harm the social, economic, and political well-being of racialized communities. As I continue to work with communities to address long-standing forms of racism and other inequalities, I will hold the NDP accountable to the vision outlined in their vision document.”

The many suspicions surrounding the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the role of the Saudi regime in the conflict in Yemen, and the human rights situation in the country should, according to UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard, call into question the Canadian Prime Minister's presence at the 2020 summit. When the Liberal government was elected in 2015, it promised the return of Canadian leadership on the international stage. Yet, more than eight months after committing to review arms export permits to Saudi Arabia, the government is still unable to give a timetable. In the meantime, Canadian weapons are fuelling the crisis in Yemen. It must be said that the Liberals are not doing much better than the Conservatives before them.

NDP: Access to Employment Insurance must be Improved OTTAWA - Today, the NDP reacted to a report released by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives that recommends significant reforms to the Employment Insurance system to make it more accessible, particularly for low-income workers. ""This report highlights one of the most serious problems we face – growing economic inequality,"" said NDP MP Niki Ashton (Churchill—Keewatinook Aski). “The effects of inequality are exponential, while the most vulnerable workers are also the most likely to fall through the cracks of the social safety net. Decades of cuts by the Liberals and Conservatives have meant that the employment insurance system is only there for a small minority of workers. The system needs to be thoroughly fixed so that it works for everyone.” The report notes that the share of unemployed workers eligible for EI benefits is around 40%, but only 28% of unemployed workers who were earning $15 or less per hour were eligible for benefits in 2017. The report also points out that low-income workers contributed 1.8% of their employment income while higher-income workers contributed 1.1% of their income. ""It is completely unacceptable that low-income workers contribute substantially more than higher-income workers and that they have less access to benefits than what they are supposed to receive,"" said NDP MP Brigitte Sansoucy (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot). “In our New Deal for People, we propose major changes to the system to ensure that all Canadian workers have access to the help they deserve when they need it.” ",2019-06-27

Reality Check: Conservatives Open to Bending the Rules for Corporate Friends Scheer too cozy with big corporation to speak out OTTAWA – When it comes to standing up for Canadians and the rule of law against powerful corporate interests, it’s clear that Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives would have chosen their insider friends from SNC-Lavalin too. Andrew Scheer met with SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce to discuss deferred prosecution agreements as recently as May 2018. (Toronto Star, Feb. 10 2019)
Following that meeting, Scheer would not speak out against a secret deal for SNC-Lavalin: “when asked if Scheer had a position on whether SNC-Lavalin should get such a deal, Harrison would only say that Scheer ‘is opposed to politicians interfering to get charges dropped for accused corporate criminals.’” (Toronto Star, Feb. 10 2019).
In March 2019, Scheer continued to sidestep the question of what he would do when companies break the law, saying that deferred prosecution agreements are “not the issue” he’s concerned with in regard to the SNC-Lavalin controversy. (Global News, March 23 2019)
Scheer’s reluctance to take on corporations that break the law isn’t surprising when you consider the Conservative record: in 2013 it was revealed that at least three companies had been given federal contracts despite violating government integrity policies (iPolitics, June 4 2013) – and in May 2015, the CEO of SNC-Lavalin stated that he had made efforts to seek a settlement with the previous government in order to avoid a lengthy criminal trial. (Trudeau II Report, p. 11) But the coziness between big corporations and Scheer’s Conservatives does not stop there: In April 2019, the Conservatives opposed an NDP motion opposing corporate influence over the Government of Canada (Vote No. 1299)
In April 2019, Andrew Scheer attended a day-long election strategy session with wealthy oil executives at a luxury resort in Alberta earlier this month (National Observer, April 26 2019)
Just like the Liberals, the Conservatives received max donations from at least 20 chairs and executives of rich companies last year. (CTV News, July 29 2019) “We cannot trust either Justin Trudeau or Andrew Scheer to stand up to big corporations; both of them move mountains to help the richest corporations instead of helping everyday Canadians. On October 21, together we have a chance to clean up Ottawa and elect an NDP government that will work for people instead of the wealthiest.” New Democrats have committed to formally prohibiting corporations facing criminal charges from lobbying elected officials.

As Trudeau Campaigns on Abortion, Millions of Canadians Still Face Barriers Accessing It While Justin Trudeau styles himself a defender of abortion rights, his record tells a very different story. People in rural communities across Canada are often forced to travel hundreds of kilometers to access an abortion, while some provinces continue to openly obstruct access. In New Brunswick, abortion services are only covered if performed in a hospital.  Those seeking abortions from private clinics pay up to $850 out of pocket. Many communities have no abortion clinic nearby. In Nova Scotia, barriers to access can sometimes mean travelling over 500 km to a hospital that will provide the procedure. In PEI, abortions only became available in 2016, and there is still only one clinic that provides them. Earlier this year, the Leader of the PEI Liberals attended an anti-choice rally. But the Liberals have refused to impose real consequences if provinces make it hard to access abortion. New Democrats will make sure that abortion services are safe and accessible no matter where you live by enforcing the Canada Health Act, and stepping in to fund abortion services when provinces refuse to do so. The NDP will also bring in a universal pharmacare program that will cover prescription contraceptives at no cost. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “No Canadian should struggle to access the essential health care services they need. Despite what Justin Trudeau is saying about choice, he has refused to stand up for the millions of Canadians who still can’t access a safe and legal abortion.

This report proves that the Liberal government has put the wealthy and the well-connected above the law – and the Prime Minister himself is directly responsible,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. Commissioner Dion was clear that SNC-Lavalin “overwhelmingly stood to benefit from Ms. Wilson-Raybould's intervention”, and that he has “no doubt that the result of Mr. Trudeau's influence would have furthered SNC-Lavalin's interests”. He concluded that Trudeau’s actions were against the constitutional principles of prosecutorial independence and the rule of law. “Justin Trudeau is not who he pretends to be,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay). “Behind closed doors, we now have proof that this Prime Minister went so far as to break the law to cut backroom deals for his corporate friends and to benefit his political party.

Singh Promises Immediate Relief for Students OTTAWA – Jagmeet Singh and the New Democrats have announced a plan to cancel the interest on all existing and future student loans. “Young people, just starting out, deserve a shot to get ahead and build their best life. We need to make sure that cost is never a barrier to education, and we can give those who recently left school relief from the struggle to make ends meet,” said Singh. “It’s wrong for the government to be profiting off the backs of students and grads. That’s why I will eliminate all interest on federal student loans — both outstanding loans, and going forward.” Over the last four years, Trudeau’s Liberals have taken almost $3 billion from graduates in interest payments – profiting from skyrocketing student debt. “Young people deserve to graduate with hope for a better future, not a crushing debt load,” said Singh. “They shouldn’t have to live with their parents because of student debt. They shouldn’t be trapped working hard and not getting by. And they shouldn’t have to put off starting their own family because of student debt. But that’s what’s happening now. “Eliminating the interest on student loans is a simple first step to make it easier to build a good life, and I’m looking forward to talking about more of our plans in the weeks to come.” Singh was joined by Andrew Cash, NDP candidate for Davenport, at a roundtable with young people to discuss the challenges faced by new graduates.

A graduate with a debt of $20,000 will save $5,000.
The NDP’s New Deal for People also commits to moving from student loans to non-repayable grants, and to a future where post-secondary education is fully part of the public education system so kids can go from kindergarten to a career, without the barrier of cost. ",2019-09-05

A national universal pharmacare plan and a national dental care plan, delivering affordability and better health to Canadians.
A home people can afford, including massive investments in housing, real action on money laundering and a tax on foreign speculators.
Beginning to tackle student debt, by taking all interest off of student loans, current and future.
Lower cell phone and internet bills, by capping prices.
A bold plan and concrete action to fight the climate crisis, ending the subsidies to big oil companies, committing to science-based targets and helping workers during the transition from fossil fuels.
Ensuring the super-wealthy are paying their fair share by introducing a super wealth tax, closing tax loopholes, and ending giveaways for the richest companies and individuals. Singh’s platform includes a Super-Wealth Tax on fortunes over $20 million; an end to offshore tax havens, legally used by the wealthy to avoid paying Canadian taxes; ending all fossil fuel subsidies; and ending tax loopholes.

NDP Will Help More Canadians Get the Dental Care They Need It’s time to expand health care coverage from head-to-toe SUDBURY – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced the unprecedented commitment of making the first step towards free dental care for all Canadians. Including dental care in our health care system for those who don’t get the care they need will help millions of Canadians. ""No one should have to deal with the pain or lifelong damage of going without dental care,"" said Singh. ""Some people have workplace insurance plans – but millions of Canadians don't have any dental coverage at all. Trudeau's Liberals refuse to even consider helping these Canadians. This doesn't make sense. We need to ensure people are getting the care they need."" Millions of Canadians don’t visit the dentist every year because they can't afford to. Liberals and Conservatives chose to ignore these needs. New Democrats will work together with provincial partners and health professionals to expand Medicare to include dental services. ""Our Denticare plan is a down payment on Tommy Douglas' vision – comprehensive dental care as part of our healthcare system,"" added Singh. ""Unlike the Liberals and the Conservatives, New Democrats are going to help people who need it, right now."" This is all part of the NDP's New Deal for People to make life more affordable for families, young people and seniors. Facts Our plan will extend public dental care coverage to 4.3 million Canadians.
We will put in place a national dental care plan to help uninsured Canadians with household incomes below $90,000, starting right away in 2020.
Dental care will be free for housholds making under $70,000, with a sliding copayment for those who earn between $70,000 and $90,000.
Under the NDP’s Denticare plan, a family of four that has a household income of $70,000 or less would save at least $1,240 if they received the recommended dental examinations and cleanings in a single year, and if each child was treated for a single cavity.
Our Denticare plan is a first step towards Tommy Douglas’ vision – comprehensive dental care as part of our healthcare system. He championed the idea more than thirty years ago: ""The ultimate goal of Medicare must be to keep people well rather than just patching them up when they get sick... It means expanding and improving Medicare by providing pharmacare and denticare programs."" (The Future of Medicare, 1984)
Almost 20% of Canadians avoid the dentist every year because of the cost.
Ignoring dental care needs end up costing our health care system. Emergency room visits because of dental emergencies cost taxpayers at least $155 million annually but often don’t address underlying dental issues, leading to return visits and ongoing pressures on our health care system.
The Liberals have refused to even consider helping Canadians with their dental care needs. In fact, Liberal Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor recently said, with respect to dental care, that “no federal investments are being made”. ",2019-09-18

Under public pressure, he eventually let her testify to the Ethics Commissioner and the Justice Committee – but his waiver only applied to selective time periods and didn’t allow her to discuss the controversial Cabinet shuffle that saw her moved from Justice to Veterans’ Affairs.

This year, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Kwan each moved motions in Parliament urging the end of sex discrimination in the Indian Act, but they were shut down by the Liberal government. “Sex discrimination against First Nations women and their descendants has been enshrined in Canada's shameful colonial laws for more than one hundred years,” said Kwan. “First Nations people across the country should have the right to self-govern and be able to determine their own membership. The demands of First Nations women who have been fighting against this injustice for generations must be honoured and respected.” The final report of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry calls for ending the sex discrimination in the Indian Act. The Inquiry’s Calls to Justice were the latest demand to end discrimination against First Nations women after the “17 Tuesdays” movement and the advocacy work from groups such as the Native Women’s Association, Femmes Autochtones du Québec, and the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action. “Ending the discrimination is a necessary step towards decolonizing Canada.

Instead of listening to scientific advice from his future candidate, Trudeau bought the pipeline five days after the article was published.

This is a blow for the Canadian steel industry and the whole Canadian economy. Communities across Canada have been let down by Justin Trudeau’s Liberals failing to negotiate a trade deal that protects their jobs. New Democrats know this could have been avoided if the Liberals had stood up to Trump in the NAFTA re-negotiation process. Instead of putting the interests of Canadian workers first, the Liberals withdrew their demand for access to the U.S. procurement market, and pushed forward the New NAFTA with devastating tariffs on our steel and aluminum still in place.  The latest “Buy America” procurement provisions with a 95% domestic steel and iron threshold will restrict Canadians from bidding on many new contracts, jeopardizing our jobs and our highly integrated economies, particularly in the manufacturing sector. What we have in front of us is more evidence of a Liberal government that has failed to stand up for Canadian workers and our steel sector. Once again, the Liberals failure to stand up for workers will result in losses that should have been avoided. When will they start fighting for good paying jobs instead of caving to Donald Trump?

Liberal inaction on Inuit housing and the national mould crisis in Indigenous communities is leaving thousands of families in unsafe homes. “Weak climate targets we won’t meet for 200 years, a shuttered climate change research program and families who are already food insecure and often living in unsafe homes: Justin Trudeau shouldn’t be proud of his record on Canada’s North,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “He’ll go pose for photos and hug northerners, but when he gets back to Ottawa and behind closed doors, Trudeau is working for the big polluters and corporations that take advantage of Iqaluit families.”  
		On the climate, New Democrats’ New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs, is the only plan to promise dramatically reduced carbon emissions while creating 300,000 good jobs.  
		Reconciliation is at the heart of the New Deal for People, and New Democrats will make the investments it takes to solve food insecurity and get families the safe, affordable housing they deserve. ",2019-08-01

NDP Commits to Undoing Liberal Disappointments for Indigenous Peoples Jagmeet Singh and Chief Rudy Turtle campaign in Grassy Narrows GRASSY NARROWS — NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and the NDP candidate for Kenora, Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle, were in Grassy Narrows Saturday to talk about the New Democrats’ commitment to reconciliation and undoing the wake of disappointment Justin Trudeau and the Liberals have left in First Nations communities. In 2015, Trudeau promised a new relationship with Indigenous peoples, but four years later Indigenous people have been let down and even mocked by the Liberal Leader. “Mr. Trudeau said all the right things about reconciliation — but reconciliation is about action to make people’s lives better, not just pretty words,” said Singh. “The way Mr. Trudeau has treated Indigenous people hasn’t matched up with his words or promises.” On Friday, the federal government announced it is taking First Nations children to court, appealing a ruling that said the government ""willfully and recklessly'' discriminated against them — prompting Singh to say there’s no excuse that justifies the Trudeau Liberals taking First Nations children to court and demanding Trudeau drop the appeal. And in Grassy Narrows, 50 years ago, toxic chemicals were dumped into the English River system in a corporate crime that left generations of families suffering from mercury poisoning. Trudeau has failed to sign an agreement to help the community care for those suffering the effects of the poison. Meanwhile, when a Grassy Narrows community member confronted the Liberal leader at a party fundraiser, Trudeau mockingly shot back: “Thank you for your donation.” “For First Nations people who were hopeful, the trust has been broken. We’ve been let down,” said Turtle. “The people of Grassy Narrows deserve the kind of care and treatment we would all want for our families. And from coast-to-coast-to-coast, First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities have been left waiting for clean water, decent housing and safe schools where the next generation can get a good start. Indigenous children can’t wait another four years.” Singh and New Democrats have committed to building a treatment centre for Grassy Narrows residents affected by long-term mercury exposure, working with the Nation’s leadership and the community. Singh’s New Deal for People also commits to lifting all drinking water advisories for good by 2021 in First Nations communities, and implementing Shannen’s Dream, which spells out equitable access to education, backed by federal investments and infrastructure, so no students are forced into schools that aren’t safe.

NDP: Liberal Plan for High-Speed Train Development Falls Short TROIS-RIVIÈRES – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP Transportation Critic Robert Aubin expressed their confusion at the Liberal government’s announcement of their intention to fund another study in conjunction with the Canadian Infrastructure Bank (CIB) to review Via Rail’s proposal for the High-Speed Rail project in the Quebec City-Toronto Corridor. “High-speed rail is a promising project that will stimulate regional economies, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and simplify the lives of many people. I am proud of Robert Aubin’s work on this issue. He has long recognized the potential of high-speed rail and he’s worked hard to pressure Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government to recognize the need for the project,” said Singh. “Unfortunately, what the Liberals have announced today is disappointing. At the end of their mandate, this Liberal government has only done studies and what they’ve announced yet again does not guarantee the construction of high-speed rail.” The high-speed rail project has consensus among main economic and social development actors. In addition to creating good quality jobs, the project will significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. By creating paths dedicated to passenger transportation, this public transit project will allow retirees, business people, workers and students to move quickly and comfortably through the country’s most populated corridor. “People are really disappointed to learn that the announcement was not about the project’s construction, but yet another step that does not guarantee it will be acted upon,” said Aubin. “It seems easier for Minister Morneau to invest $4.5 billion in a pipeline than for Minister Garneau to invest the same $4.5 billion in infrastructure projects for communities living in the most densely-populated corridor in Canada. We can clearly see where the priorities of Justin Trudeau’s Liberals lie!” The NDP believes that fighting climate change is an opportunity to improve people’s lives. In their environment plan, entitled Power to Change: A New Deal for Climate Action, New Democrats outlined their commitment to moving forward with high-frequency rail. This project is part of the NDP’s transportation electrification strategy. ",2019-06-25

Trudeau Plows Over His B.C. MPs to Build Pipeline Before the 2015 election, Justin Trudeau and his Liberal candidates talked a good game about involving communities in approving major resource projects like the Trans Mountain expansion. Trudeau told Canadians “governments may be able to issue permits, but only communities can grant permission.” Liberal Burnaby North-Seymour MP Terry Beech told constituents “no project can go ahead without the support of the community and without the support of partner First Nations.” After the election, Justin Trudeau broke his promise to communities and approved Trans Mountain anyway – and Liberal MPs did nothing to stop him. Liberal MPs like Joyce Murray, Hedy Fry, Pamela Goldsmith-Jones, and Terry Beech complained that Trudeau’s decision would make it difficult for them to be re-elected, but did nothing to stand up for British Columbians and stop Trans Mountain from going ahead. Jagmeet and New Democrats will listen to people and communities and stop the pipeline expansion. ",2019-09-24

NDP Will Fight For Families Left Behind By Liberals VANCOUVER – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wrapped up his swing through British Columbia by meeting with young people and families who have been left behind and let down by Justin Trudeau and the Liberals. “It’s hard for working families to get ahead when the Liberals keep giving breaks to the richest corporations, and forcing the rest of us to pay the price,” said Singh. “Over the last four years, Justin Trudeau had no problem finding billions of dollars in tax giveaways for his corporate friends – but he left Canadians waiting for help on drug costs, child care and finding an affordable place to call home.” Singh noted that after over twenty years of promising pharmacare, the Liberals appear to have completely given up on their commitment. Their recent platform failed to specifically dedicate a single dollar to pharmacare, dental care or making rent more affordable. “Like Liberals do every election, Justin Trudeau is trying to scare Canadians into settling for less – but New Democrats know that you deserve better,” added Singh. “Families are struggling, and they need help now. We’ve got a bold plan to make life more affordable, strengthen health care and confront the climate crisis. New Democrats will fight for you.” It’s all part of the NDP’s New Deal for People to create 500,000 affordable child care spaces within four years, launch a universal pharmacare program, bring in no-cost dental coverage for working families who need it, expand affordable housing and give struggling families immediate help with rent, and lift the burden of student debt by cancelling all federal loan interest.
