FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

TORONTO, ON
– Today, Peter Kent, the Conservative Shadow Minister for Ethics, called on
Justin Trudeau to remove Liberal MP Joe Peschisolido from caucus until the RCMP
gets to the bottom of his alleged ties to organized crime. Kent
issued the following statement:

“This morning’s media reports are extremely concerning.  It is not
appropriate for any Member of Parliament to be connected to criminals and
Justin Trudeau and the Liberals can no longer look the other way.  They
should remove Joe Peschisolido from the Liberal caucus until the RCMP gets to
the bottom of this.

“Leadership starts at the top, and Justin Trudeau has shown his caucus and
cabinet that it’s okay to bend the rules to suit your own political and
personal self-interests.

“Justin Trudeau was the first Prime Minister in our country’s history to be
found guilty of breaking Conflict of Interest rules. Since then, there have
been three other Trudeau Liberals found guilty of ethics violations. Now, we
know the RCMP is probing Peschisolido and former Trudeau Liberal MP Raj Grewal.

“Justin Trudeau promised to be different. He promised ‘sunny ways,’ but clearly
he is Not as Advertised.”

BACKGROUNDER:

Trudeau Liberal RCMP
Probes:  
Raj
     Grewal’s India Guests – The RCMP has launched an investigation into
     the actions of former Trudeau Liberal MP Raj Grewal. According to the
     Prime Minister’s Office, the RCMP has asked questions related to Grewal’s
     invitation of a former business partner onto Trudeau’s disastrous trip to
     India.
 Trudeau
Liberal Ethics Violations:  
Justin
     Trudeau’s illegal vacation to a private island
     – Justin Trudeau was the first Prime Minister in Canada’s history to have
     been found to have broken Conflict of Interest rules
     for two all-expenses paid vacations to a private island in the Bahamas.
      Bill
     Morneau’s fancy French villa – The Finance Minister was found guilty for breaking conflict of interest
     rules after failing to disclose the private corporation which
     housed his fancy French villa. This ruling came after months of ethics
     questions surrounding Bill Morneau’s holding of shares in Morneau Shepell
     which could have benefited from the Trudeau Liberal pension changes. ClaClam
     Scam – Dominic Leblanc was found to
     have broken conflict of interest rules for
     awarding a lucrative clam fishing license to a company run by his wife’s
     cousin. Since then Leblanc has been under fire for his close personal relationships to five of the six
     recently appointed New Brunswick judges.The
     Municipal Robocalls – Just this week, the Conflict
     of Interest Commissioner found Trudeau Liberal MP Anita Vandenbeld in violation of the Conflict of Interest Code
     for using her public office to try and help get her husband elected as an
     Ottawa City Councillor.  
Finally, it’s worth
noting that there continues to be two outstanding Conflict of Interest
investigations into Trudeau Liberals. Canadians are still awaiting verdicts on
the probes into Trudeau’s office’s involvement in the SNC-Lavalin scandal and into Raj Grewal’s actions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – Pierre Paul-Hus, Shadow Minister for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, issued a statement following the final vote on the Liberals’ new firearms legislation, Bill C-71:
“Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have failed to address gun crime. Instead, their legislation senselessly targeting law-abiding gun owners has passed it’s final legislative hurdle.
“Imposing a backdoor gun registry does nothing to keep Canadians safe. Not only does it fail to address gang violence or target gang criminals, but the word “gang” does not even appear in the bill.
“Conservatives believe in putting dangerous criminals behind bars where they belong, as well as respecting the rights of law-abiding firearms owners.
“A Conservative Government led by Andrew Scheer will get tough on gangs, give law enforcement the tools they need to keep Canadians safe and crack down on illegal gun smuggling. And we will repeal C-71 once and for all.”

New conservative government to extend EI parental leave to parents in mourning
A new Conservative government will ensure
that EI parental leave is extended for eight weeks following the death of a
baby, affording parents experiencing unimaginable tragedy a much-needed
opportunity to begin coping with their loss.
“With this policy, we hope to give grieving parents some
much-needed support during a time of unimaginable loss,” said Blake Richards,
Conservative Candidate for Banff-Airdrie. “The government can, and must, do
more to support Canadians undergoing such trying times.”
The loss of a child is a situation no parents should ever
have to face. Unfortunately, so many Canadians across the country are put in
this terrible situation and parents are sometimes forced to return to work with
no opportunity to begin to address the profound and recent tragedy that
confronts them.
Currently, EI parental benefits end abruptly the week
following the loss of a child, which comes as a shock to many. A parent’s
sadness should not be compounded by financial worry, and these parents should
not have to worry about their bottom line. Extending EI parental benefits is
the least a government can do.
“There is nothing that can prepare a parent for this experience. We hope that by offering more time, parents will have the important opportunity to cope, to seek help, and to be comforted by those around then,” said Richards. “My deepest sympathies go out to parents who have struggled with the loss of a child. I am proud that a new Conservative government will do more to provide support and relief to Canadians experiencing such difficult times in their lives.”
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives – “The death of a child, at any age is a painful experience – and the loss of a child is followed by the most intense grief. By extending EI benefits to grieving parents, a Conservative government will provide some relief to mourning parents.”

Conservatives unveil fully costed platform that eliminates Justin Trudeau’s deficit by 2024.
Today, Canada’s Conservatives released Andrew Scheer’s
Plan for You to Get Ahead, a fully
costed platform that details how a new Conservative government will live within
its means and put more money in your pockets.
In his remarks, Andrew Scheer
offered examples of how typical Canadian families will get ahead under a new
Conservative government:
Under a new Conservative government,
an average retired couple living in Tsawwassen will save $2,580 a year.Under a new Conservative government, a family of four – soon to be five –
in Montreal will save $4,642 a year.Under a new Conservative government,
a family of four in Markham will save $3,264 a year.
“Under
Justin Trudeau, Canadians are working harder and harder, but they’re just not
getting ahead. Everything keeps getting more expensive and if Trudeau is
re-elected, it will only get worse,” Scheer said.
“My Plan For You To Get Ahead is filled with
achievable and tangible ways that a new Conservative government under my
leadership will put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.”
The Conservative
platform also shows a costed and independently verified path back to a balanced
budget by 2024-2025. This will be done through a combination of spending
restraint and reductions to both corporate handouts to profitable corporations
and foreign aid to relatively wealthy countries.
“My
plan eliminates Justin Trudeau’s damaging deficits because Conservatives know a
balanced budget is the only way to make sure services like health care are
protected,” Scheer said. 
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will provide:
1. More money for you, for your kids, and for your retirement 
By scrapping Trudeau’s carbon tax, providing a Universal Tax Cut, taking the GST off home heating, making maternity benefits tax-free, boosting the RESP, increasing the Age Credit, bringing back tax credits for children’s arts, fitness, and learning, and introducing the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit.
2. More good jobs
By reversing Trudeau’s tax hikes on small business, creating a National Energy Corridor to generate opportunities, boosting innovation and commercialization, supporting economic immigration, promoting interprovincial trade, building infrastructure projects that reduce commute times and lower emissions, and more.
3. More innovation to fight climate change 
By taking the fight against climate change global and incentivizing industry to develop emissions-reducing technology that can be shared with the world’s highest-emitting countries.
4. More help at home
By supporting our veterans, improving our correctional system, securing our neighbourhoods, strengthening border protection, reducing health care wait times, and more.
5. More strength abroad 
By
confronting the global complexities of climate change, human migration,
cybersecurity, and national defence, renewing relationships with important
allies, and standing up for Canada on the world stage. 
“It’s
time to turn the page on four years of broken promises. As Canadians, it’s time
for Canadians to look to the future once again with confidence,” Scheer said. 
The
platform was verified by Jack Mintz, President’s Fellow at the University of
Calgary’s School of Public Policy.
“I
conclude, therefore, that the Conservative Party fiscal plan is reasonably
estimated, resulting in a budgetary balance in five years subject to
uncertainties that impact any economic forecast including those of the PBO,”
Mintz said.

an expansion of the Child Disability Tax Credit. 
But
the last time Justin Trudeau needed money for his out-of-control deficit

In
2016 Justin Trudeau ordered the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to crack down on

FOR
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – Andrew Scheer, Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and Leader of the Official Opposition, issued the following statement on Black Ribbon Day, the National Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Communism and Nazism in Europe:  “Today, communities across Canada and around the world will take part in ceremonies to mark Black Ribbon Day, a day of tribute to the millions of innocent victims of Communism and Nazism in Europe. 
“Established in
2009 by a unanimous decision of the House of Commons, Black Ribbon Day
commemorates the signing of the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Orchestrated
eighty years ago between the Soviet and National Socialist regimes, this secret
agreement divided Europe into spheres of influence and resulted in the suffering,
humiliation, and death of millions of innocent victims.
On September 1,
1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland from the West, provoking the outbreak of
World War II, and then an equally brutal invasion by the Soviet Union in the
East followed two weeks later. 
“Stalin’s secret
agreement with Hitler allowed the Nazis to perpetrate the Holocaust, while the
Soviets invaded several other independent sovereign nations and sent many
innocent men and women to forced-labour camps, also known as gulags. 
“Following the
end of the war, the Nazi regime was destroyed, but the Soviet regime survived
and spread its terror across the eastern half of Europe for decades. It was not
finally stopped until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
“Many of those fleeing Soviet communist
persecution and oppression made Canada their home. Often arriving alone
and with little means, these remarkably strong-willed and hard-working
individuals made incredible contributions to our society. 
“We
must strongly condemn any whitewashing of the atrocities committed by the Nazi
and Soviet regimes, and the spread of hate, propaganda, and disinformation.

“On behalf of the Conservative Party of Canada and Official Opposition, I
commend those organizing and participating in Black Ribbon Day observances
today. I join with you in remembering the victims of Soviet and Nazi terror in
Europe. It is our duty to educate future generations about the atrocities of
the past in order to ensure that these murderous ideologies never have a chance
to rise again.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 REGINA, SK – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, released the following statement regarding the Trudeau government’s shipbuilding announcement today:
 “There are less than 100 days to the next election, and the Trudeau government is once again campaigning on the taxpayers’ dime, trying to buy people’s votes with their own money.
 “While it is good to see shipbuilding work go to Davie, today’s announcement is nothing but cynical electioneering from a government that will do anything and say anything to cling to power.
 “Canada’s Conservatives have championed the hard-working women and men at the Davie shipyard since day one, because they have delivered much needed ships on time and on budget. Our track-record of support is in direct contrast to the Trudeau government’s record of failure and disappointment. One of the very first things the Trudeau government tried to do after the 2015 election was to try and cancel the Asterix contract with Davie, and when it didn’t go their way they smeared the reputation of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman – a 38 year veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces.
 “When it comes to the shipbuilding industry, the Trudeau government has only ever encouraged delays and mismanagement. They have costed Canadian taxpayers billions of dollars.
 “Canada’s Conservatives will always stand up for our shipbuilding industry and for the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces. This is why, in November of 2017, we called on Justin Trudeau and the Liberals to order a second interim supply ship from Davie. The Trudeau Government has once again failed to do the right thing.
 “While the Trudeau Liberals will try to swoop in at the final-hour, right before an election to buy people’s votes, Canadians should not be fooled. Justin Trudeau is clearly Not as Advertised.”

Justin Trudeau signed letter endorsing a Liberal-NDP coalition in 2008, just months after first being elected as a Member of Parliament
Justin Trudeau will pay any price to hold
onto power. He was willing to do it in 2008 and he is willing to do it now.
As a newly elected Member of Parliament in 2008, one of
Justin Trudeau’s first orders of business was to sign a letter to the Governor
General announcing his support and participation in a Liberal-Bloc-NDP
coalition. https://cpcassets.conservative.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15120538/0d1734dbea4f1b5.pdf
In fact, according to Brian Topp, one of the chief
negotiators of the coalition was Trudeau’s most trusted advisor, Katie Telford.
The 2008 coalition, like the coalition Trudeau refuses to
rule out with Jagmeet Singh, would have led to economic disaster in Canada with
skyrocketing taxes and mass unemployment. 
Canadians cannot trust Justin Trudeau. If he won’t rule
out a coalition with the NDP, it’s because he has a secret plan to do it when
he is defeated. If Trudeau has no plan to join a coalition, why won’t he simply
say it? 
Trudeau is already promising higher taxes and bigger
deficits if he’s re-elected. Imagine how much more you will pay with Trudeau
held hostage by the NDP.
The NDP’s price for propping up Trudeau will be even
higher taxes, more reckless spending, fewer jobs, bigger deficits, and more
debt.
The choice is clear. A Liberal-NDP coalition that will
cost you thousands of dollars more, or a Conservative government that will live
within its means and put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.

conservative,https://www.conservative.ca/five-unanswered-questions-regarding-justin-trudeaus-plastics-ban/,"
Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives recognize that plastic pollution is a real problem that needs to be addressed.
Justin Trudeau has had three and a half years to come up with a real plan for the environment. Instead of real action, Justin Trudeau has always been more interested in chasing headlines and jet-setting to international photo-ops with celebrity friends.
What Justin Trudeau announced today is nothing more than a cynical re-election gimmick which will do nothing to reduce plastic waste and clean up litter in our parks and waterways.
Today’s announcement leaves Canadians with more questions than answers. Here are five things we still don’t know:
1) How much will this cost Canadians?
Whether it’s the local grocer or the family restaurant, small businesses use plastics to offer affordable options to customers. Whether it’s a picnic or a backyard barbeque, families depend on affordable plastic products as they spend quality time together in the summer months.
Regardless of the details of Justin Trudeau’s announcement, it will be responsible Canadians who will pay the price of this cynical re-election scheme. The people deserve to know exactly how much this will cost families and job-creators.
https://www.thestar.com/halifax/2019/06/05/canadians-eager-to-cut-plastic-packaging-on-food-but-lose-their-appetite-once-the-price-increases-study-finds.html
2) What about China and the developing world?
Global problems require global solutions. Going after responsible Canadian consumers while ignoring the real problems that are happening around the world will do nothing to prevent plastic pollution in our oceans.
Here are some cold-hard facts that Justin Trudeau seems to be forgetting as he announces this cynical re-election scheme:
• The majority of all ocean plastics is coming from the developing world: https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-truth-about-ocean-plastic-why-straw-bans-are-not-the-earth-saving-milestone-you-might-think
• A 2017 Ocean Conservancy report concluded that 60 per cent of the world’s ocean plastic pollution could be traced to just five countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam: https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/full-report-stemming-the.pdf
• A 2017 study from Germany’s Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research concluded that up to 95 per cent of the world’s ocean plastic was coming from 10 rivers: Eight in Asia and two in Africa: https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=36336&webc_pm=34/2017
3) Why isn’t Justin Trudeau addressing the root of the problem – plastic waste recycling in Canada?
Canadians are responsible environmental stewards who want to take action close to home to build a better environment for their children and grandchildren.
Canadians want to dispose of their waste responsibly; however a report done earlier this year by Deloitte and ChemInfo Services found that in 2016 only 9 per cent of plastic waste was recycled in Canada, with 87 per cent ending up in landfills: https://www.taxpayer.com/media/En4-366-1-2019-eng.pdf
4) What is Justin Trudeau’s plan for the more than 90,000 Canadians employed in plastics manufacturing?
Between 2012 and 2017, plastics manufacturing became one of the fastest-growing sectors in the entire country. There are 93,000 people employed in the plastics industry in more than 1,900 companies based mainly in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta: https://www.taxpayer.com/media/En4-366-1-2019-eng.pdf
There are 93,000 Canadian families who depend on the plastics industry to keep their lights on and put food on their table.
5) When will Justin Trudeau stop sending Canada’s recycling to other countries to be burned?
Justin Trudeau has created global uncertainty after a number of Asian countries started rejecting Canada’s plastic waste, including China, Malaysia, India, and the Philippines: https://globalnews.ca/news/5199883/canada-recycling-programs/
Any announcement Justin Trudeau makes today, is nothing but a cynical re-election ploy if it doesn’t involve global conservations about the disposal of plastic waste in the developing world.

  *   Chief John Helin – National Coalition of Chiefs (SOURCE: http://www.cpac.ca/en/programs/headline-politics/episodes/66003913)
 
“If the bill is approved as amended by the House, it will hurt our capacity to
create the interprovincial transmission lines necessary to create modern
electrical grids in Canada, it will challenge our ability to improve our ports
to keep Canada connected to global supply chains, and it will make it harder to
develop the infrastructure and rail networks that keep Canadians an Canadian
goods moving.”
 
“The repercussions will hit manufacturers, exporters, and even down to the
technology companies that provide software and services to our major

“Adopting Bill C-69 without the Senate’s proposed amendments is putting
Canada’s economic future in jeopardy, and sacrificing the livelihoods of
hundreds of thousands of Canadians by introducing an unworkable Bill that
increases uncertainty for investors and makes it harder for those directly
impacted by projects to participate.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“Today, I
am pleased to congratulate all those in Canada and around the world celebrating
the 74th anniversary of Korea’s independence from colonialism at the end of the
Second World War. Today we recognize the contributions of Canadians of Korean
heritage and recall Canada’s role in the continued preservation of freedom in
South Korea.  
“Canada
played a key role in protecting Korea’s independence in later years. While
those in the North did not get to experience the full benefits of the
liberation, as one form of subjugation was replaced by another that continues
to this day, Canada enjoys a special friendship with the Republic of Korea in
the South. Over 26,000 Canadians served during the Korean War between 1950 and
1953; 516 gave their lives, and thousands were wounded fighting for freedom and
against communist imperialism. More than 7,000 Canadian soldiers also served in
ongoing peace-keeping duties after the signing of the Armistice.
“Canada is
home to a vibrant Korean community, and our friendship with South Korea grows
continually, as highlighted by the Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement negotiated
and implemented by our previous Conservative government in 2015.
“On behalf
of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to everyone
celebrating the 74th anniversary of the Liberation of Korea. 
“Happy
National Liberation Day of Korea!”

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Lakeland, AB – Shannon Stubbs, Shadow Minister for Natural Resources, issued the following statement on Minister Sohi attending the Energy and Mines Ministers’ Conference in Cranbrook, British Columbia: 
“This week, Minister Sohi has the opportunity to listen to his provincial counterparts instead of ignoring the continued calls of the Premiers to cancel the Liberals’ job killing carbon tax, reverse the anti-resource and anti-pipeline Bill C-69, end the oil export ban Bill C-48, and give back power over economic development to the North that the Liberals removed in Bill C-88. 
 “If Prime Minister Trudeau’s Liberals are serious about making Canada’s energy and mining sectors competitive, Minister Sohi would commit to immediately scrapping Bill C-69 and axing the carbon tax in front of his provincial and territorial partners this week. But Prime Minister Trudeau’s Liberals won’t, because they always put the special interests of a small group of anti-resource and anti-energy activists ahead of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who work in Canada’s natural resource sectors. 
 “There is no region of this country that the Liberals’ anti-resource development agenda has not harmed: from offshore drilling in Atlantic Canada, to oil and gas development in the North, to mining in Quebec, Ontario and BC, and oil and gas development across Western Canada. The Liberals imposed new taxes, increased red-tape, created uncertainty and chaos for project developers, all at the cost of good-paying Canadian jobs – putting Canada at a disadvantage against international competitors. 
 “The Liberal plan to kill Canada’s resource industries is no surprise. Prime Minister Trudeau has been open about his plan to ‘phase-out’ the oil and gas sector, and feels the need to apologize to his international billionaire friends for Canada’s environmentally and socially responsible natural resources. 
 “The Liberals rammed through a carbon tax that makes new mines and resource development in rural and remote communities less competitive. The ‘no more pipelines’ Bill C-69 kills jobs, drives away investment, and already cost our economy billions. Bill C-48 blocks Western Canadian oil from international markets, while doing nothing to stop foreign imported oil from countries with terrible environmental and human rights records. The Liberals also prohibited resource development on wide swaths of northern land – without consultation and without warning.   
















“Canada’s
Conservatives will always stand with struggling families who rely on Canada’s
natural resource jobs. Conservatives will scrap the ‘no more pipelines’ Bill
C-69, axe the carbon tax, and give certainty to the private sector to get
pipelines built. Conservatives are proud of Canada’s world class production of
natural resources, have a plan to get Canadian resources to global markets, and
will finally help hard working Canadians to get-ahead.”

Scheer to restore order, fairness, and compassion to Canada’s immigration system
A new Conservative government will restore
public confidence in Canada’s immigration system by stopping the flow of
illegal border crossers from the United States and prioritizing newcomers from
the world’s most dangerous countries, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said.
“Canadians’ confidence in the immigration system has been
rocked by Justin Trudeau’s chaos and mismanagement,” Scheer said. “When
everybody follows the rules and the laws are enforced, immigration is good for
the economy, good for jobs, and good for the people who have chosen to come to
Canada.
As Prime Minister, I will take steps to restore confidence
in the system and make sure Canada’s immigration system prioritizes those who
need Canada’s help the most.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Prioritize funding to support immigration services like language training, credential recognition, as      well as services specifically designed for vulnerable newcomers like women, girls, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.Prioritize those who apply to come to Canada through the appropriate immigration streams, especially in the family reunification program.Close the loophole in the Safe Third Country Agreement.Move existing Immigration and Refugee Board judges to common illegal border crossing points, speeding up the process and therefore making it less attractive to enter Canada illegally.Hire an additional 250 CBSA enforcement officers.Listen carefully to provinces on immigration issues, with an aim to work closely to best accommodate their needs and priorities. A Conservative government would be ready to negotiate with the Government of Quebec to discuss the selection of those who wish to settle in Quebec.  We will be open to requests to amend the Canada-Quebec Accord on Immigration.
“These measures will restore fairness and compassion to
our immigration system while providing stronger enforcement of the law at the
border,” said Scheer. “If these measures aren’t taken, confidence in
immigration will continue to slide and legitimate refugees will wait longer and
longer for Canada’s help.”
FACTS:
In 2017, Justin Trudeau created an illegal border crossing crisis in Canada with his #WelcomeToCanada tweet, resulting in more than 50,000 illegal border crossers entering Canada and      costing taxpayers $1.6 billion.A poll in August 2018 found that 65% of Canadians believed the massive influx of illegal border crossers      was a “crisis.”Justin Trudeau has compensated Roxham Road residents $400,000 of taxpayer money for “disruptions” from those crossing the border illegally.Canada is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law, and fundamental and universal human rights, and these values must be reflected in our immigration system.Only a Conservative government will restore compassion and fairness to Canada’s immigration system while protecting and securing our borders.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your      family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax      Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income      Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50%, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians      for green home improvements.

Canadians are looking for relief at the gas pumps. Trudeau is only making it worse.
With Saudi Arabia set to shut down half its crude
production, global oil prices will go through the roof, and take gasoline
prices with them.

What does that mean for you? At the pumps, overnight, you could be paying 12 to
25 cents more for gas.

Canadians just can’t afford that.

The question is: What is Trudeau’s plan?

We know the carbon tax is going up. Trudeau’s
environment minister Cathrine McKenna confirmed it. And just today, Liberal
MP Marco Mendicino refused to
answer questions on how much it will go up. 

Yesterday, Conservatives revealed that Trudeau’s carbon tax hike will add 31
cents a litre to the price of gas. So at a time when gas prices are set to
shoot up, Trudeau’s plan is to actually make it worse.

Andrew Scheer and the Conservative will scrap the carbon tax, putting more
money in your pockets so you can get ahead.

This situation of global uncertainty and speculation is also exactly why Canada
needs to build pipelines to get Canadian oil to global markets and to work to
greater energy independence.

We cannot put the bottom line of Canadians at risk.

Andrew Scheer and Canada’s Conservatives have a plan to build a national energy
corridor and to make Canada energy independent by 2030.

Under the Trudeau Liberals, Canada hasn’t built a single inch of pipeline.
Instead, Justin Trudeau levelled a punishing carbon tax, making Canada’s oil
and gas sector less competitive, further driving up the price of gas for
Canadians.

Justin Trudeau has even gone so far as to say he want to “phase-out” Canada’s
oil and gas sector and that high gas prices are “exactly what we want.”

There are a number of Liberal
candidates, running for Justin Trudeau, who are opposed to any oil and gas
development:
 
Justin Trudeau’s star candidate, Steven Guilbeault, has been on the record a number of times opposing the TMX pipeline expansion.Estelle Hjertaas, the Liberal      candidate in Prince Albert, tweeted “[Justin Trudeau] it’s up to you to      say no to Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain” and “False #oilprice narrative used to scare Canadians into accepting Trans Mountain pipeline expansion”Karina Gould, a Trudeau cabinet minister, tweeted “It’s time to landlock Alberta’s tar sands”

What is Justin Trudeau’s plan to protect Canadian drivers and get Canadian oil
to global markets?

Yesterday Postmedia exposed numerous sexist
comments by Justin Trudeau’s handpicked candidate in Sydney-Victoria, Jamie
Battiste, which were made between 2012-2016.
While some of Battiste’s comments are too inappropriate to

clean, cook and fold laundry.
These comments are disgusting and inexcusable. An
individual who makes this many disparaging comments is not worthy of sitting in

“Despite these sexist comments, Battiste is allowed to run
as a Liberal candidate for Justin Trudeau,” said Lisa Raitt, Conservative

groping a journalist in British Columbia, or throwing strong women out of his
caucus for standing up for the rule-of-law, Trudeau never lives up to his own

“At present, across the country, provinces and territories

jurisdictional inequalities in service deliveries that force families to move
or seek services away from home.
“Canada’s Conservatives believe that the federal
government can play an important role in developing a strategy to assist those

work with autism stakeholders to develop a National Autism Strategy.
“An initial investment of $50 million over five years

 New Conservative government to remove museum admission fees, celebrate past Prime Ministers 
A new Conservative government will scrap
admission fees from all of Canada’s national museums, Conservative Leader
Andrew Scheer announced today.
Removing these fees will make it easier for families to
learn about Canada’s proud history and will make school field trips and family
vacations more affordable.
“National museums celebrate Canada by sharing our
foundational stories and most cherished artifacts, the very things that make us
Canadian. They are places of beauty, discovery, and inspiration,” said Scheer.
“Making them more accessible to Canadians and visitors is part of our plan to
celebrate Canadian culture and make life more affordable for families across
the country.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will make it free to
visit national museums 365 days a year for every visitor.
There are nine national museums across Canada:
Canada Agriculture and Food Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum of History (Gatineau, Quebec)Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 (Halifax, Nova Scotia)Canada Science and Technology Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa, Ontario)Canada Aviation and Space Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum of Nature (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum for Human Rights (Winnipeg, Manitoba)Canadian War Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)
A new Conservative government will also designate the RCMP
Heritage Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan as a national museum. Admission would
also be free.
Scheer announced that a new Conservative government will
also designate the gravesites of past Prime Ministers and Governors General as
national historic sites.
“We can and we should celebrate the achievements of our
historical giants like William Lyon Mackenzie King, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and
Sir John A. Macdonald,” Scheer said. “These leaders, and others, have left
their mark not only on our country, but on the entire world and they are worthy
of honour and respect.”
FACTS:
The first National Museum of Canada was established by the Department of Mines in 1927.The current system of national museums (listed above) are administered by six Crown Corporations.According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, this move would save Canadians more than $20 million per year.Admission fees generally represent small proportions of these museums’ revenue mix; these other revenue streams, including Parliamentary appropriations, will not be impacted by this measure, except to increase the appropriations to compensate for reduced revenue from this policy.Smithsonian Institution museums in Washington, D.C. have offered free admission since 1846.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
OTTAWA, ON
– Today, the Honourable Andrew Scheer, the Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and
of the Official Opposition, issued the following statement regarding Justin
Trudeau’s Carbon Tax:
 
“Justin Trudeau pretends he has a plan for climate change but its clear
that his Carbon Tax will not even come close to achieving Canada’s emissions
reductions targets.  The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) confirmed
today that his plan is not as advertised. 
 
“Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would need to be $102 per tonne in order to reach
Canada’s Paris targets. That’s five times more expensive than it is today,
meaning Canadians will pay more for groceries, home heating and gasoline prices
will jump 23 cents a litre.
 
“The Liberal Carbon Tax isn’t a plan to lower emissions, it’s just another cash
grab which is hurting already over taxed Canadians.  That is why my first
act as Prime Minister will be to scrap the Carbon Tax, leaving more money in
Canadians’ pockets, so that they can get ahead.
 
“I will also be unveiling A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment on June
19.  Unlike the Liberal plan, which is not an environmental plan but a
plan to raises taxes on Canadians, our Conservative plan will take meaningful
action to protect our environment while protecting Canadian taxpayers.”

OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues statement to mark the Anniversary of India’s Independence:
“Today, Canadians of Indian descent and the Indian diaspora around the world celebrate the 73rd year of India’s Independence.
“This anniversary represents how India has long been an example of political freedoms and economic opportunity, as it continues to play an important role on the world stage. Boasting a population of over 1 billion people, India’s presence on the international stage and increasing economic development have helped foster international peace and security and helped millions of people to rise out of poverty.
“Canada’s relationship with India has been longstanding, and our two countries have much in common as fellow nations of the Commonwealth, including our shared history and our common values of democracy, pluralism, and economic development.  I was honoured to visit India this past fall to meet with Prime Minister Modi and other Indian governmental, business, and civil leaders, to highlight the importance of this critical relationship.
“Today, over one million people of Indian descent from many different religious and cultural communities call Canada home. The Indo-Canadian community has made tremendous contributions to our country’s success in areas of art, trade, business, technological advancements, and education, helping to keep it strong and prosperous.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I extend my best wishes to everyone celebrating the anniversary of India’s Independence!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Edmonton, AB – Today, the Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and Leader of the Official Opposition, said as Prime Minister he would work with the provinces to implement the Interprovincial Free Trade Agreement (IFTA), a new agreement that will create free trade between provinces and territories.
“My goal will be simple: A brand new and truly free interprovincial trade agreement. The Interprovincial Free Trade Agreement,” Scheer said.
Scheer made the proposal in his fourth My Vision For Canada speech today in Edmonton. Called A Stronger and Freer Federation, the speech outlined Scheer’s vision for how to strengthen Canadian confederation to benefit Canadians.
“To do it, I will appoint a Minister of Interprovincial Trade, whose sole responsibility will be to lead the negotiations and the implementation. I am not talking about an accord or a pact or a memorandum of understanding. This will be nothing like the half-hearted attempts at improving internal trade that have marked our recent history. The Interprovincial Free Trade Agreement will be a free trade deal. Like NAFTA. Like CETA. Like the TPP. Negotiated freely in the spirit of open federalism, with nothing more than the basic promise of greater prosperity bringing all parties to the table.”
Scheer promised to convene a First Minister’s meeting within the first 100 days of a new Conservative government with a new trade agreement at the top of the agenda.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Regina, SK
– The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the
Official Opposition, issued a statement following former Liberal cabinet
minister and Justin Trudeau’s former Ambassador to China John McCallum’s recent
comments on the ongoing China-Canada dispute:
 
“I forcefully and unequivocally condemn recent comments by high-profile
Liberals encouraging the Chinese government to help re-elect the government
this October. This invitation of foreign interference in the Canadian election
– to a regime that has proven itself hostile to Canadian interests – is
absolutely reprehensible.
 
“I also find it appalling that Liberals are attempting to win favour with a
communist government that is illegally detaining two Canadian citizens and
blocking Canadian agricultural imports. Instead of scheming with the Government
of China to win re-election, Liberals should advocate for the safe return of
Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and the restoration of Canadian canola and
meat imports to China.
 
“That Justin Trudeau appointed John McCallum – someone who has repeatedly
advocated against Canada’s interests – to one of Canada’s most important
diplomatic posts demonstrates his incompetence and poor judgment on the world
stage.
 
“However, this latest episode is not particularly surprising considering
Trudeau’s admiration for the Chinese communist regime – or China’s ‘basic
dictatorship,’ as he once put it. As Prime Minister, he has continually failed
to stand up for Canadian interests and has instead chosen to appease the
Government of China at every turn. This approach has failed.
 
“A new Conservative government will always stand up for Canada’s interests on
the world stage and will not allow any country that wishes us harm to push us
around.”

Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act could help 35,000 more Canadians with disabilities
A new Conservative government will introduce the Fairness for
Persons with Disabilities Act, allowing 35,000 more Canadians to qualify and
apply for the Disability Tax Credit, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today. 
This new Act will reduce the number of hours spent per week on
life-sustaining therapy needed to qualify for the credit from 14 to 10. It will
also expand the definition of what counts as life-sustaining therapy to include
determining dosages of medical food and activities related to determining dosages
of medication, including dietary or exercise regimes. This would allow 35,000
more Canadians with disabilities the potential to access savings of an average
of $2,100 a year.
“A new Conservative government will support Canadians with
disabilities in ways that leave more money in their pockets to help them manage
their health needs,” Scheer said. “We will make sure that Canadians with a
disability can care for themselves and parents of children with disabilities can
support their children without worrying about their bottom line.”
Under our policy, a Canadian with type
1 diabetes who currently spends an average of 10 hours per week managing his or
her condition would qualify for the Disability Tax Credit.
In 2017, Justin Trudeau changed how Canadians qualify for the
Disability Tax Credit and the Registered Disability Savings Plan, stripping
important financial support from thousands of Canadians with disabilities.
“Trudeau
has made life more expensive for all Canadians, including those with
disabilities,” Scheer said. “A new Conservative government will live within its
means. We will lower your taxes and put more money in your pocket so you can worry
less about your bottom line and focus on living life to your full potential.” 
Conservative MP Tom Kmiec introduced the Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act in 2018 but the bill did
not pass before parliament was dissolved.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home      heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up      to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of families who make green-home improvements.

Today, Justin
Trudeau and the Liberals are unveiling their election platform – much like the
2015 version it’s not worth the wasted ink and the paper it’s printed on. 
In the last
election, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals promised a lot, but once elected they
broke promise after promise and made life more expensive and unaffordable for
families. Plain and simple, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. If Justin
Trudeau is re-elected he will once again break his promises to Canadians and
raise taxes on hard-working Canadian families. 
Let’s take a
look at some of Justin Trudeau’s most notable broken promises. 
Balanced
Budgets: 
“I am
looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way I always have. We’ve
said we are committed to balanced budgets and we are. We will balance that
budget in 2019.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
It’s 2019, and
as we can see the budget did not “balance itself.” Justin Trudeau is running
endless deficits that threaten the social services Canadians depend on and if
re-elected Trudeau will just raise your taxes to pay for his out of control
spending. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Electoral
Reform: 
“As Prime
Minister, I’ll make sure the 2015 election will be the last under
first-past-the-post system.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
There’s another
election, and guess what? It’s being held under first-past-the-post. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Veterans: 
“Our plan
will give back to those who have given so much in service to all Canadians, and
will ensure that no veteran has to fight the government for the support and compensation
they have earned.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election Platform
Justin Trudeau
looked a military hero in the eye – a man who lost his leg fighting for our
country – and said that veterans are “asking for more than we are able to
give.” 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Accountability:

“We will
restore trust in our democracy.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election
Platform
Justin Trudeau
was the first Prime Minister in our country’s history to be found guilty of
breaking ethics laws, and he did it not once but twice! 
Justin Trudeau
has stonewalled the Ethics Commissioner, shut-down parliamentary committees
search for answers into Liberal corruption scandals, and he is now doing
everything in his power to block the RCMP from investigating his office. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Lower Taxes
for the Middle Class: 
“We will
give middle class Canadians a tax break.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015
Election Platform
Justin Trudeau
has raised taxes on 80 per cent of middle-class families, and his carbon tax
punishes everyday moms and dads driving their kids to hockey practice. 
If Justin
Trudeau is re-elected, his carbon tax is going to increase the price of
gasoline by 31 cents per litre.

“Today, I am happy to join Christians from different
traditions across Canada in celebrating the Assumption.” 
“The feast of the Assumption, also known as the Dormition of
the Virgin Mary, is a day of joy for many Catholic, Orthodox, and other
Christian communities across the country, celebrating the Blessed Virgin’s
entrance into heaven at the end of her earthly life, a sign to all of the
redemptive power found in Jesus Christ. 
Celebrated in different traditions and cultures and known by
many different names across Canada, the celebration of the Assumption is a
symbol of our diversity in unity. 
“Canada is blessed with devout and diverse Christian
Communities. On holy days, such as today, we are especially grateful for their
contributions to our nation’s heritage, culture and traditions.”

my best wishes for a blessed feast day to everyone celebrating across the
country.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Prince George, B.C. — Todd Doherty, Conservative Shadow Minister for Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, released the following statement today regarding the Trudeau government’s announcement for the Canadian Coast Guard:
“While Conservatives support the much-needed procurement of new ships for the Canadian Coast Guard, we are concerned that the Liberals have waited until the last minute to make this announcement and have no plan to actually deliver. Just like we saw with their defence plan, the Liberals continue to make big spending promises, with no plan to actually pay for them.
“The Liberal record on shipbuilding is abysmal. There have been numerous delays because of Liberal mismanagement, which has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. This includes repeated extensions to the design competition for the Canadian Surface Combatant. Justin Trudeau has also refused to award the conversion contract for the second supply ship, Obélix, to the Davie shipyard despite the fact that they delivered the Astérix on time and on budget.
“Our previous Conservative government was proud to launch the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy, to deliver the ships our men and women in uniform need and deserve. However, clearly more must be done. No Canadian shipyard should be sitting idle. The Canadian Coast Guard needs new ships, especially heavy icebreakers, as soon as possible.
“Conservatives have been pressuring the Trudeau government for years on this very issue. With the longest coast line in the world and oldest coast guard fleet, it is about time this Liberals took notice. Conservatives will continue to support the Canadian Coast Guard to ensure that they get the ships they need to keep Canadians safe, while ensuring the best value for taxpayers.”

Scheer is confirmed to attend both the commissioner
English (Oct. 7) and French (Oct. 10) debates. Scheer is also confirmed to

Munk Debate on foreign policy on Oct. 1.
Why won’t Justin Trudeau attend the Maclean’s/CityTV

Just because Trudeau has a lot to run away and hide from
doesn’t mean he should.
He has made life harder and more unaffordable for families
– bringing in a carbon tax and raising taxes on 80% of middle class families.
He is the first Prime Minister in Canadian history to be
found guilty of breaking ethics laws – not once, but twice.
He has been incredibly weak on the world stage – backing
down to Donald Trump on NAFTA, humiliating Canada and severely damaging
relations with India, and failing to stand up for Canada’s interests in China.
And, he has broken promise after promise to the Canadian
people.
Plain and simple, he is not as advertised.
Trudeau should stand before Canadians and answer for these
failures. Instead, he’s running away.
Andrew Scheer is planning to hold Justin Trudeau accountable on the debate-stage while highlighting his own plan to help Canadians get ahead. It’s time for Justin Trudeau to stop hiding.

The Conservative Party of Canada announced country music
singer George Canyon will be the Conservative Party of Canada candidate in the
riding of Central Nova for the federal election. Canyon, originally from Pictou
County, Nova Scotia, has won multiple Canadian Country Music Association, East
Coast Music, and Juno Awards, along with volunteer honours from Diabetes Canada
for his advocacy bringing attention to diabetes.  
“I’m excited to add somebody of George’s experience and
talent to the Conservative team,” said Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives. “Central Nova is George’s home riding and he understands
the challenges people there face trying to get ahead. As their MP, I know he
will work hard to make sure they are heard in Ottawa.”
Canyon’s family, wife Jennifer, and children Kale and
Madison, have always come first in his life, and his passion for Nova Scotia
has never waned throughout his career. He is a Nova Scotia Country Music Hall
of Fame inductee, but more importantly, a Type-1 Diabetic that has used his
platform to bring attention to diabetes research. 
“Excited doesn’t even begin to describe what I’m feeling
today as I become the Conservative candidate for Central Nova,” said George
Canyon. “I believe that if you work hard, you should be able to buy a home,
save for retirement, and care for your children and aging parents, and I want
to be part of a team that understands that. Afterall, it’s hard enough to get
ahead without the government making it harder. Over the next nine weeks, I’m
going to wear the soles out of my boots as I work hard to show people here the
type of representative and advocate I will be for them.” 
Canyon has also been made an Honorary Colonel for 14 Wing
Greenwood Air Force Base in Nova Scotia in 2008 and was appointed the first
ever Colonel Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. He’s a proud Nova
Scotian and huge hockey fan, and is in his sixth season singing the national
anthem during Calgary Flames home games. 
“We’re all completely behind George, and eager to get to
work as we show how a Conservative government will help people get ahead, not
just get by,” said Ryan Sharpe, Central Nova Conservative Association
President. “I’m confident Central Nova will get the attention it deserves from
our federal government with George as our Member of Parliament, and I know our
grassroots volunteers and supporters fully support his campaign.” 
With Canyon in place as the candidate, the Conservative

Canada. Election Day is October 21, 2019.

The Honourable Andrew

letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this morning calling on him to scrap
his secret fuel tax.
The following is an excerpt from the letter:“Your carbon tax has
already increased the cost of gasoline by five cents a litre. This has made it
more expensive for moms and dads to drive to their kids to soccer practice, for
seniors to get to their doctors appointments, for farmers to plant their crops,
and for small business owners to serve their customers. Everyday essentials
like groceries and home heating have also become more expensive, meaning more
Canadians are just getting by, instead of getting ahead.Your secret fuel tax will
undoubtedly increase the cost of gasoline by at least another four cents a
litre, a fact you continue to hide. It is also an unprecedented tax that will
apply to all fuel sources, including the fuel used for manufacturing and home
heating, which will make Canadian businesses less competitive and gas more
expensive.”
The letter goes on to say:“Prime Minister, Canadians
are tired of your government’s never-ending tax hikes and deserve to know the
truth. You promised transparency, but yet again are not as advertised.Given these facts, will
you scrap your secret fuel tax?I can assure you that this

“Of course, Trudeau has set the tone for this government. He was the first

Yesterday, Justin Trudeau was interviewed by

economic record and ethical scandals.
“Trudeau claimed he lowered taxes on the middle-class. In
fact, he raised taxes on 80% of middle-class families and brought in a carbon
tax that makes gasoline, groceries, and home heating even more expensive.
“Trudeau also claimed that he supports first-time home
buyers, when in fact he will raise their taxes even higher as a result of his
endless deficits.
“Trudeau tried to assure reporters he wants to restore
confidence in government institutions, but he used the power of his office to
reward his supporters and punish his critics.
“Most absurdly, Justin Trudeau lied about why he broke
federal law, when he claimed that his motivation during the SNC corruption
scandal was to save jobs. This was simply a made up talking point by the
Liberal Party of Canada. What’s worse, when he was challenged to show evidence,
Trudeau could not answer a direct question about where the 9,000 jobs number
came from.
“Under Justin Trudeau, the scandals will continue and life
will get even more unaffordable. He is not as advertised.
“In contrast, a new Conservative government led by Prime
Minister Andrew Scheer will follow and respect the law, all while living within
its means, and putting more money in your pocket so you can get ahead.”

The reason for this pressure was reportedly due to the ‘election environment’ and therefore Mr. Mulroney had to be ‘very, very careful’.   “This exchange is highly inappropriate and represents a blatant attempt by Justin Trudeau to muzzle a respected former career diplomat. Trudeau has shown a clear pattern of silencing those who speak out.   “Justin Trudeau once said he admires China’s ‘basic dictatorship’, but this is not how things are done in Canada.   “This also raises questions as to whether or not officials have been ordered by Trudeau’s PMO to speak with former Ambassador to China, and former Trudeau cabinet minister, John McCallum. Mr. McCallum has made a number of inappropriate statements over the past year – including his comments on Canada’s extradition process and his encouragement of Chinese foreign interference in the upcoming election.   “As Mr. Mulroney stated, discouraging private citizens with expertise in foreign relations from speaking freely is ‘fundamentally an undemocratic idea’.

“As the Ethics Commissioner notes in his report, “the authority of the Prime
Minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine, and ultimately
discredit,” Jody Wilson-Raybould.
 
“He promised he would be open and honest. But let’s remember on the day this

Wilson-Raybould.  We know now that is false.  He also said that she
never came to him with her concerns.  Again, we know now that was
false.  And he said that he would be happy to work and cooperate with the
Ethics Commissioner.  And now we know that is false as well.
 
“He promised he would be different.  Instead, we now know, beyond a shadow
of a doubt, that Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.  He has stated so
many falsehoods that no one can believe anything he says.
 
“Trudeau may never face a court of law for his role in this scandal, but he
will have to face the Canadian people over the next few weeks.
 
“And on the eve of this election, the choice before Canadians has never been
more clear. Between a Prime Minister who abuses his power, bends the law for
his friends, attempts to silence his critics and destroys their
reputations.  And a Conservative government led by a Prime Minister who
will uphold the rule of law, respect our democratic institutions, and help all
Canadians get ahead.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues the following statement on Korean War Veterans Day, marking the 66th anniversary of the signing of the Korean War Armistice: 
“On this day every year, it is a fitting occasion for Canada to reflect on the sacrifices made by courageous Canadian soldiers, sailors, and airmen during the Korean War. 
“Over 26,000 Canadian Armed Forces personnel joined together with our allies to fight against a violent communist regime. Today, we mark 66 years since the signing of the armistice on July 27th, 1953, which ended the hostilities. More than 7,000 Canadians continued to serve in related peacekeeping duties over the decades that followed.  
“Today, we honour the veterans who bravely fought for peace and who risked their lives in the name of freedom. We also remember the 516 Canadians who gave their lives in this fight for freedom. Their ultimate sacrifice will forever be remembered and honoured by Canada. 
“I encourage all Canadians to take the time to reflect on the lessons of the Korean War and show their gratitude to our veterans who sacrificed everything to protect the fundamental values that we hold so dear. 
“Lest we forget.”

New Military Covenant will clear backlog for Veterans’ benefits within 24 months
Canadian Veterans struggling with months-long waits
for pensions and benefits can count on a new Conservative government to take
immediate action to get them the support they deserve.
Andrew Scheer, leader of Canada’s Conservatives,
announced a comprehensive plan today to deliver more help to Canada’s Veterans
in a timely and respectful manner.
“To every Veteran who has struggled and who
continues to struggle without the support and benefits you have earned through
your service, my message is this: You deserve better. After October 21, we are
going to make things better,” Scheer said. “Instead of forcing Veterans to work
harder for government benefits, it’s time the government worked harder for our Veterans’
benefit. It’s time for a government that works harder for you; it’s time for
you to get ahead.”
Scheer highlighted that a new Conservative
government will:
Enshrine, in legislation, a Military Covenant between the Government of
Canada and all Canada’s Veterans. This will guarantee that every Veteran is
treated with respect and is provided services in a timely manner.Clear the current backlog of Veterans’ benefit applications within 24
months.Create a reliable, dependable pension system that, unlike the Liberal
status quo, is fair to Canada’s most disabled Veterans.Strengthen transition services to support discharged or retired Canadian
Armed Forces members.Strike an independent inquiry to provide answers about Canadian Armed
Forces members who were administered mefloquine.Provide more service dogs to Canadian Veterans in their communities.Put vital
commemoration projects, like the National Memorial for Canada’s War in
Afghanistan, back on track.
“These actions are simple, straightforward, and
practical,” said Scheer. “They require new investment from a new government, but
even more importantly, they require new priorities.  Our military heroes are deserving. Our
military heroes are worth it.”
In 2015, Justin Trudeau promised that no Veteran
would have to “fight the government for the support and compensation they have
earned.”  Yet under the Trudeau Liberals
the number of Veterans left stranded on government waitlists had ballooned to
40,000 – a growth of over 33 per cent. Worst of all, Trudeau continues to fight
Veterans in court, and has dismissed their concerns saying, “They’re asking for
more than we are able to give.”
“Justin Trudeau never turned back SNC-Lavalin’s
lobbyists or claimed they were ‘asking for more than he was able give’,” said Scheer.
“When corporate lobbyists get the red carpet while Veterans get left out in the
cold, it’s proof that Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.”
“To our Veterans, whether you are among the
vanishing generations of heroes who served in 
World War II and the Korean War, or whether you are one of the heroes of
Afghanistan or conflict zones around the world, you deserve our gratitude,”
said Scheer.  
“When we look out for our Veterans, we are looking
out for the people who dedicated their lives to looking out for us. It’s time
for government that will stand up for our Veterans. It’s time for a
Conservative government that will help you get ahead.”

conservative,https://www.conservative.ca/scheer-introduces-cyber-security-measures-to-protect-your-personal-data/,"
Today, the Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives,
announced the measures he would take, as Prime Minister, to safeguard
Canadians’ personal data online. 
 
“The Trudeau Liberal government has been particularly careless on this front,”
said Scheer at the Montreal Chamber of Commerce. “Just recently a Quebec
company made headlines, but they are not the only casualty to this crime. Many
Canadian companies are at risk of being the next victims of these criminals.”
 
“It’s past-time the federal government did something to protect Canadians’
information online,” said Scheer.
 
Increasingly, parts of our lives, important interactions and transactions are
moved online. Paying your monthly bills, transferring money between accounts,
making large purchases, and investing is all done with the click of a button or
the tap of a device. It is vital, that the government adopt new policies and
keep up with technology to make sure that Canadians – their money and their
personal information – is protected. 
 
A Conservative government would take a three-pronged approach to this issue:
sensible regulation, standards and education to ensure that consumers can make
informed decisions, and strong oversight at the highest levels of
government.  
We will ensure that plain language use agreements are put in place so that companies collecting electronic data must receive informed consent from Canadians.We will apply regulatory standards for the ethical and secure use of      artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and create the Canada      Cyber Safe brand to ensure that consumers know when products have met rigorous security standards.An expert committee with industry leaders will define binding cyber security standards for critical infrastructure sectors and penalties for non-compliance.
“As Prime Minister, I
will also establish a Cabinet Committee on Cyber Security and Data Privacy and
conduct periodic cyber security penetration testing on all government
departments and establish performance benchmarks for senior public servants,”
said Scheer. 
 
FACTS : 

Today, Canadians are connected more than ever before, sharing and storing personal information online. Only thirty-four per cent of companies have data protection and control measures.Fifty-four per cent of Canadian businesses were affected by cybersecurity incidents that prevented employees from doing their jobs.Justin Trudeau’s Government has failed to take meaningful action on this front and we have seen numerous incidents impacting millions of Canadians.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 
Regina, SK
– The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the
Official Opposition, released the following statement regarding the resignation
of the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff Paul Wynnyk:
 
“Justin Trudeau’s meddling and political interference has created
unprecedented chaos in the Canadian Armed Forces. In four years, he has
destroyed the careers of two of our country’s most senior military
officers and caused instability and turmoil at the highest levels of the
military.
 
“Vice-Admiral Mark Norman gave 38 years of his life in service to our great
country. He served with honour and integrity, even in the face of Trudeau’s
disgusting smear campaign against him.
 
“Despite everything that has come out, there remain serious and credible questions
about the Trudeau Liberals’ political interference in the Norman prosecution.
Now, as a direct result of Trudeau’s interference, we have once again lost
our military’s second-in-command. Like Mr. Norman, Paul Wynnyk is an
accomplished and dedicated military officer who has been caught in the middle
of Trudeau’s incompetence and poor judgment.
 
“The brave men and women who serve our country as a part of the Canadian Armed
Forces deserve stability and respect. Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau and
the Liberals have continually put their political self-interests ahead of the
heroes who put their lives on the line for our freedom.
 
“This is wrong and unconscionable. We must do better. Justin Trudeau promised
to be different, but clearly he is not as advertised. Under my leadership a
Conservative government will do better.”
 
Unanswered Questions
in the Norman Affair:
Why did the Liberals go to such great lengths to withhold evidence from Mark      Norman’s defence team?
How much are Canadian taxpayers on the hook for Trudeau’s settlement with      Mark Norman?
Was this all a part of an expensive scheme to cover-up Justin Trudeau’s political problems before an election?

serving in a range of roles – both in opposition and in government – as a
Canadian Alliance and then Conservative MP. He was always a champion for his

“Deepak was a constant source of joy inside the Conservative caucus. He
brightened every room he walked into and often injected warmth, kindness, and

“Personally, I will always have fond memories of the time we spent together
during the Conservative Party of Canada leadership race. In addition to the

New tax credit will allow Canadians to save up to $3,800 on green home renovations
Conservative
Leader Andrew Scheer was at Potvin & Bouchard today, highlighting the Conservatives’
proposed Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, a two-year program to encourage
homeowners to renovate their homes in ways that lower their power bills and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Canadians
will be eligible to receive a 20% refundable credit on their income tax for
green improvements to their homes of over $1,000 and up to $20,000. This would
allow Canadians to save up to $3,800
on their renovations each year.
Eligible renovations would include: 
Installation of high-quality insulation Investments in high-efficiency furnaces Replacement of doors and windows with more efficient models Upgrading of ventilation, heating and cooling systemsInstallation of solar panels 
In
2017, emissions from buildings represented 12% of Canada’s overall emissions. 
“No
environmental plan is complete without a serious plan to tackle emissions from
buildings,” Scheer said. “Our Green Home Renovation Tax Credit will help lower
these emissions and fight climate change while putting more money in Canadians’
pockets so they can get ahead.”
This measure is one of the 55 policies of our environmental plan, A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment, introduced earlier this year. It is a realistic plan that balances Canada’s obligation to fight climate change with the core Conservative promise to put more money in Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead.
FACTS:
Justin Trudeau’s signature so-called environmental policy is, in reality, not an environmental policy at all. His Carbon Tax gives big polluters a pass while punishing Canadians for driving to work and heating their homes.Canadian families and small businesses pay 92% of Trudeau’s Carbon Tax, while big polluters are only on the hook for 8%. Justin Trudeau and his environment minister have confirmed that a carbon tax hike is on the table, and the Conservative Party conducted research to determine just how much it would cost the average Canadian household. At the $102/ tonne level, Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would Increase the cost of natural gas by $469 per year Add 31 cents/litre to the price of gasoline. This means $2/litre gasoline is just around the corner if the Trudeau Liberals are re-elected. It is Canadians who bear the cost of Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax. In Ontario, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,151.In New Brunswick, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $959.In Manitoba, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,116.In Saskatchewan, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,930.In Alberta, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $2,002.
Andrew Scheer’s Plan for you to get ahead:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax,
lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut,
saving an average couple $850 per
year.Take the GST off home
heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public
Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free,
putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness
Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports
activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts

Reducing lowest-income tax bracket will put more than $850 back into the pockets of an average Canadian family
The
average Canadian family will save over $850 per year on their income taxes
after a Conservative government reduces the rate of the lowest-income tax
bracket with the Universal Tax Cut, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today.
“It’s
time for a universal tax cut that is focused on you,” said Scheer. “We’re going
to deliver a tax cut targeted specifically at taxpayers in the lowest-income
tax bracket. This means that every Canadian will see their income taxes go
down, and those in the lowest tax bracket see the biggest benefit of all.”
With
the Universal Tax Cut, the tax rate on income under $47,630 will be reduced
from 15 per cent to 13.75 per cent. This will allow an individual taxpayer to
save as much as $440 on their taxes. A two-income couple earning an average
salary would save over $850 per year.  
“That’s
$850 back in your pocket each and every year,” said Scheer. “This means more
money to pay the bills, to save up for your kids’ education or maybe even
finally afford a family vacation.”
Scheer
compared the Universal Tax Cut to the Trudeau Liberal record. Despite
campaigning on a promise to help the middle class, Justin Trudeau refused to
reduce the low-income tax bracket. Instead, the Liberals increased taxes on
essentials like transit passes, textbooks, and after school programs for kids,
while introducing a carbon tax that targets lower income families by increasing
the cost of gasoline, home heating and groceries. Today, 80 per cent of
Canadian middle-class families are paying an average of $800 more per year in
tax compared to when Trudeau was elected.
“Justin
Trudeau is not as advertised,” said Scheer. “Justin Trudeau has always been
able to find millions of dollars to hand out to well-connected corporations.
Under the Liberals, the more you have, the more you get. That’s not how
government should work.”
The
Universal Tax Cut is the next step in the Conservative plan to put more money
back in your pockets. Scheer has already announced that a Conservative
government will:
Cancel the Trudeau Carbon Tax.Take the GST off home heating, saving an
average household $107.Make all maternity benefits tax free, saving
new parents up to $4000. Introduce a Green Public Transit Tax Credit,
saving a family hundreds of dollars per year. 
“You
shouldn’t have to be a billionaire to get your government’s attention. Instead
you deserve a government that respects how hard you work and how much you
already pay,” said Scheer. “You deserve a Conservative government whose first priority
will be to help you get ahead.”

Ottawa, ON

Conservative Shadow Minister for Natural Resources, released a statement
following the final vote on Bill C-48 in the Senate:
 
“Today is a bad day for Canada’s energy sector and the entire Canadian economy.
Bill C-48 will help landlock Canadian energy exports and cost the Canadian
economy billions of dollars. It will rob Indigenous communities in Northern BC
and across the Prairies of potential economic development opportunities.
 
“This bill is an open and transparent attack on Canada’s oil and gas sector. It
is an anti-pipeline bill poorly masquerading as an environmental bill.
Environmental legislation should be based on science, but Bill C-48 is not. The
Liberals announced it 25 days after the 2015 election, with no consultation of
Indigenous communities, no scientific evidence, and no environmental, safety,
or economic independent analysis. Rather, it is part of Justin Trudeau’s intent
to ‘phase out’ Canada’s oil.

“The Nisga’a, the Lax Kw’alaams, the 35 First Nations along the potential Eagle
Spirit energy corridor, and hundreds of other Indigenous communities and
Indigenous-owned businesses, oppose Bill C-48.
 
“Nine premiers and all three territories raised grave concerns with Justin
Trudeau’s anti-energy policies and their severe impact on the Canadian economy.
Instead of engaging the premiers, and accepting their constructive solutions,
Justin Trudeau ignored and dismissed them, along with the millions of Canadians
they represent, and rammed through C-48 and C-69 in the dying days of
Parliament.
 
“While Justin Trudeau is dividing Canadians, killing pipeline projects, and
forcing Canadians to pay his job killing Carbon Tax, Andrew Scheer has a plan
to unite Canadians, advance economic reconciliation with Indigenous peoples,
use green technology instead of taxes to lower Canada’s emissions, lower global
emissions by exporting Canada’s world class technology and ethically-produced
natural resources, and get Canada’s energy sector back to work. That is why an
Andrew Scheer lead Conservative government in will repeal Bill C-49.”

According to B’nai
Brith Canada, Justin Trudeau’s candidate Iqra Khalid continues to associate
with known anitsemite Amin El-Maoued, who advocates for violence and
discrimination against the Jewish community.




Khalid was forced to apologize last year for giving
El-Maoued a certificate of appreciation from Justin Trudeau. At the time Khalid
claimed she condemned his antisemitic views. 
But we now know her apology was a lie.
Recently Khalid attended an event at the home
of El-Maoued. He confirmed in social media posts that Khalid apologized to him
for condemning his antisemitism. El-Maoued blames the “Zionist lobby” for
forcing Khalid to having to issue a public apology.
In response to this news, Khalid says that she
accepts that El-Maoued is not antisemtic, despite the fact that he uses
antisemitic language and leads rallies to call for the destruction of Israel.
El-Maoued is active in the Liberal Party of
Canada, donating and attending party conventions with Justin Trudeau.
Antisemites like Khalid and El-Maoued feel they
have a home in Trudeau’s Liberal Party. 
But what Jewish Canadians are asking is: why did Justin Trudeau fire antisemite Hassan Guillet but continues to support Iqra Khalid?

Toronto, ON –
The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the
Official Opposition, issued the following statement regarding the decision by
the Court of Appeal of Ontario today:

“I agree with Justice Huscroft’s statement that ‘Parliament cannot insist that
its preferred means of dealing with a problem be implemented by the provinces
when that means encroaches on provincial lawmaking authority.’

“Ontarians have said loud and clear that they do not want Justin Trudeau’s
Carbon Tax. The governments of Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and New
Brunswick are each fighting the Liberal Carbon Tax and pushing back against
Trudeau’s so-called environment plan.

“When it comes to climate change, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. His
unfair Carbon Tax gives big polluters a pass and punishes Canadians for driving
to work and heating their homes. Under his plan, major emitters only pay 8% of
the total revenue collected by the carbon tax and the remaining 92% is paid for
by families and small businesses across the country.

“Every day, Canada gets further and further away from meeting the Paris
targets. Not only is the gap widening but the Parliamentary Budget Officer has
said that Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would have to increase five-times to meet the Paris
targets – making life even more unaffordable for Canadians.

“The good news is that after October 21st, provinces will no longer have to
fight the Liberal Carbon Tax in court.  My first action as Prime Minister
will be to scrap Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax and help Canadians get ahead.

“Just last week I released A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment. Our plan is
Canada’s best chance to meet the Paris targets and balances the need for Canada
to fight climate change and lower emissions with our core promise of leaving
more money in Canadians pockets and letting them get ahead.”

Justin Trudeau to distract from his scandals. 
Trudeau’s Liberals promised pharmacare in 1997
and 2004. They broke their promise then and Justin Trudeau will do it again.
Trudeau cannot be trusted and he is not as advertised.
The proof that he plans to break his promise is
found in the fact that Trudeau is only offering a fraction of the funding
needed to achieve universal pharmacare coverage.  
To pay for his massive deficits, Justin Trudeau
will cut health care funding or raise taxes on middle-class families. Liberal
cuts are exactly what happened in the 1990s, cuts Trudeau said he supported. 
Only Andrew Scheer and the Conservative Party
can be trusted to maintain and increase health care spending by 3% per year.
Under a new Conservative government, Canadians will be able to count on stable
and predictable health and social program funding.

Trudeau Liberals’ have put home ownership further out of reach for Canadians
Today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced that a new Conservative
government would introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time
homebuyers to buy a home.
“With his poor judgement and tax hikes, Justin Trudeau has put the
dream of home ownership further out of reach for so many, especially young
Canadians,” Scheer said. “As Prime Minister, I will fix his bad policies and
work to get more homes on the market to lower the price of housing.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will: 
Fix the mortgage stress test to ensure that first-time homebuyers aren’t unnecessarily prevented from accessing mortgages and work with OSFI to remove the stress test from mortgage renewals to give homeowners more options. Increase amortization periods on insured mortgages to 30 years for first-time homebuyers to lower monthly payments. Launch an inquiry into money laundering in the real estate sector and work with our industry partners to root out corrupt practices that inflate housing prices. Make surplus federal real estate available for development to increase the supply of housing. 
Canada’s
Conservatives know the government has an important role to play to put home
ownership within reach for more Canadians. When you work hard, save, and invest
in your future, the government should help you – not stand in your way. 
FACTS
New data shows the country’s youngest
buyers are affected most by the Trudeau Liberals’
stress test.Justin Trudeau’s latest homebuyer “incentive” has
so many terms and conditions that most first-time homebuyers don’t qualify.
What’s more, it only targets select cities.Right now, more than 80
per cent of middle-income families are paying $800 more in taxes a year than
they did in 2015. The cost of housing continues to skyrocket, and the carbon
tax means that everyday necessities like gas, groceries and heating your home
keep getting more and more expensive. It’s harder than ever before to save for
a down payment or monthly bills. Justin Trudeau has proven that he
can’t be trusted to help Canadians get ahead. If he’s given four more years,
his carbon tax will cost Canadians hundreds of dollars a year. Life is
expensive enough for Canadian families without Justin Trudeau costing them even
more.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs. Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest-income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boosting the government’s matching RESP contributions by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids education. For some, that could be $540 more.

A new Conservative government will work with provinces and territories to protect waters
Conservative candidate for Richmond-Arthabaska Alain Rayes was joined by Robert Coutu, candidate for La Pointe-de-l’île, and spoke at Parc de l’hôtel de ville about Canada’s Conservative’s plan to protect our waters. A new Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer will work with the provinces and municipalities to put an end to raw sewage being dumped in waterways across Canada. 
“Our waterways should not be used as a toxic dumping ground and it’s
our responsibility to protect these vital natural assets for future generations
to enjoy,” said Rayes. “In one of her first acts as environment minister,
Catherine McKenna gave the go-ahead to the City of Montreal to dump eight
billion litres of raw sewage into one of Canada’s most iconic waterways, the
Saint Lawrence River. It’s disgusting and it’s wrong. We will help put an end
to it.”
Eight billion litres is the equivalent of 3,200 Olympic-sized
swimming pools.
In
2017 alone, municipalities dumped 215 billion litres of raw sewage untreated
into lakes and rivers across the country. 
“Since taking office, Justin Trudeau has failed to protect our waterways
from pollution,” said Rayes. “This is not acceptable. Trudeau is putting the
biodiversity values of our land, waterways, and marine environments at risk.”
When it comes to the environment, Justin
Trudeau makes big promises and then fails to deliver. He claims his government
is on track to reduce
Canada’s emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 but reports by his own
government say he’s not even close. When it comes to protecting our
environment, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. 
Canada’s Conservatives have a proud legacy when it comes to
managing Canada’s natural environment and improving Canada’s environmental
performance. A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment builds on
this proud legacy andwill further
lower Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen environmental
protections, with the core Conservative
promise to put more money in Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead.
FACTS:
Since coming to
power, Justin Trudeau has done nothing to tackle this problem. He continues to
use our waterways as a dumping ground for toxic waste.In 2007, the
previous Conservative government implemented the Lake Simcoe Clean-Up Fund. It
funded over 200 community-based projects that restored fish and wildlife
populations, planted thousands of new trees, and reduced harmful sewage and
waste dumps into watersheds. The Trudeau Liberals cancelled the fund in 2017. The previous Conservative
government had an excellent track record on waste management. We created the
Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations to set higher standards for wastewater
treatment, and made wastewater investments across the country.Canada’s Conservatives
recognize the global environmental impact of climate change. That is why we
have a responsible, fully costed and effective plan to address global
emissions, built on three guiding principles: Green Technology, Not TaxesA Cleaner and Greener Natural Environment Taking the Climate Change Fight Global

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Michelle Rempel, Shadow Minister for Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship, and Pierre Paul-Hus, Shadow Minister for Public Safety, Border Security, and Emergency Preparedness, issued the following statement on reports of a spike in Mexican nationals with ties to drug cartels in Canada following the removal of the visa requirement for Mexicans:
“Today’s reports are alarming and reinforce the fact that the Liberals’ careless decision to lift visas off Mexican nationals travelling to Canada was ill-conceived and not only jeopardizes the integrity of Canada’s immigration system, but presents significant public safety risks to Canadians.
“The Canadian Border Services Agency has also warned that lifting visas would allow Mexican drug cartels to strengthen smuggling chains into Canada but the Liberals ignored their advice.
“The reports today, coupled with the dramatic rise in asylum claims, show that the Conservative Party was right all along – that the visa requirement on Mexico should never have been lifted without a formal review. It is also clear that Justin Trudeau has failed to manage our border in the context of our relationship with the Mexican government.
“Given both of these serious issues, it is incumbent upon the Liberal government to immediately take concrete steps to rectify these issues, so that an incoming government won’t have to take stronger corrective measures in the fall.
“From the beginning, Conservatives have urged Justin Trudeau to follow a standard process and conduct a formal risk assessment before removing the visa for Mexican travelers to Canada. They have, instead, ignored the advice of immigration officials, which has caused a massive spike in asylum claims and eased entry for criminals into the country.
“Successive Canadian governments have consistently applied the same objective criteria in assessing whether to grant visa exemptions. This is to ensure that visa policy is based on Canada’s national interest, and in accordance with the rule of law, rather than on arbitrary political considerations as Justin Trudeau has chosen to do.
“A Conservative government will deal swiftly and firmly with gang crime as part of our overall plan for A Safer Canada, by listing gangs in the Criminal Code and facilitating prosecutions. We will restore fairness, order, and compassion to Canada’s immigration system, and ensure it is not being abused by criminals.”

Trudeau Liberals to send another $2.544 billion dollars in debt interest payments to bankers and foreign creditors
Canadians know that Justin Trudeau is not
as advertised, and now we know that their platform is not as advertised either.

The Trudeau Liberals are failing to
account for changes in public debt charges as a result of their endless
deficits. 
In total, the Trudeau Liberal platform will send an additional $2.544 billion dollars to bankers and foreign creditors to pay for their out-of-control spending. 

The PBO offered all parties costing tools
to determine the changes to public debt charges. Clearly, the Trudeau Liberals
didn’t use these tools or the Trudeau Liberals intentionally left the numbers
out of their fiscal track. 
On top of that, a number of Trudeau Liberal promises remain un-costed by an independent analysis:  
Pharmacare; 
Net-zero emissions by 2050; 
Assigning a family doctor to every Canadian; 
Lowering after-school fees by 10 per cent; 
 High
speed internet across the country
Guaranteed paid family leave; 
With the release of their platform, Justin
Trudeau’s Liberals are doubling down on their endless deficits that threaten
the social services, like health care and education, we all depend on. 
If Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are
re-elected, they will do what they did last time and hike your taxes to pay for
their out-of-control spending. 
Additional information: 
Justin Trudeau’s campaign promises added to his existing deficits will pile on $100 billion of new      debt to the books;His deficit will hit $27.4 billion in 2020; and,Total debt by the end of Justin Trudeau’s second term would be over $800 billion.
What does that mean for you? Justin
Trudeau’s never-ending spending will threaten the quality of our health and
social programs. He will be forced to raise taxes to pay for his endless debt
and deficits.
To pay just half of Justin Trudeau’s
deficits ($14B), he would have to either:
Raise the GST by 2% or;Raise the rate on the first income tax bracket from 15% to 19% or;Raise the rate on the second income tax bracket from 20.5% to 27%

MILTON, ON
– The Honourable Lisa Raitt, Deputy Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and Shadow
Minister for Justice, issued the following statement:
 
“During the height of the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal, Justin Trudeau and
the Liberals made it clear to Canadians just how far they will go to cover up
the truth.  Justin Trudeau tried to interfere in a criminal court case and
when he got caught he shut down multiple investigations and then tried to
distract Canadians by launching a study into the possible separation of the
role of Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
 
“He even appointed former Liberal cabinet Minister Anne McLellan as an
‘independent advisor’ despite the fact that when she was appointed she was
still scheduled to make headline appearances at Liberal Party
fundraisers.  What Justin Trudeau doesn’t understand is that the problem
isn’t with the rules, the problem is when you have people who are trying to
break the rules.  Politicians who try to break rules will always find new
ways of breaking new rules.
 
“McLellan’s report was due by the end of June and even though she wasn’t
mandated to report on the culture of corruption endemic to the Liberal Party,
Justin Trudeau has still not released her recommendations.
 
“Trudeau promised accountability and transparency. He promised to do politics

“One-hundred and five years ago today, the Komagata Maru, a ship carrying nearly four hundred Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims of South Asian origin, was turned away from our shores. Forced to return to India, this event has caused terrible hardship for its passengers, ending tragically for many.
“It was a humbling experience to be a part of the first Government in Canada to officially recognize the Komagata Maru tragedy and apologize for it. It was our previous Conservative government that took a number of steps to address this terrible tragedy and make sure that for generations to come, Canadians will not forget of this dark chapter in our history.
“In addition, we created educational programs, built the first ever public museum dedicated to the tragedy that is now housed at the Khalsa Diwan Society in Vancouver, as well as the first ever public monument in Vancouver’s Harbour Green Park. As a result, in 2014 Canada Post released a special stamp on the hundredth anniversary to further create awareness.
“Today, Canada is home to well over a million Canadians of South Asian descent. Our country has been greatly enriched by the contributions of the Sikh, Hindu and Muslim communities and we are grateful for the tremendous dedication that they have shown in helping build our country.

OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues statement to mark World Refugee Day:
“Today on World Refugee Day we call to mind the plight of refugees and displaced people and celebrate Canada as a beacon of hope and land of refuge.
“Refugees and the displaced overcome countless challenges to flee sometimes horrific persecution and hardship. Leaving their homes and homelands behind, they have to demonstrate extraordinary resilience and bravery to begin their new lives in our free and open country.
“This is an opportunity to reflect on one of the most significant challenges facing humanity. Today, we are witnessing very high numbers of people either internally displaced or seeking refuge or asylum. Persecution, conflict, and instability have forced an unprecedented number of people, mostly children, out of their homes and communities and into the unknown.
“The economic, political, and social challenges that have led to displacement around the world are not lost on Canadians – whether it’s in the Middle East where Yazidis and Christians have been brutally persecuted for their religious beliefs, or in Venezuela where a corrupt and oppressive government has forced its citizens to seek a new home simply to survive, or the Rohingya people who have been denied citizenship in their native Myanmar and forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.
“The generosity of Canadians opening their homes and communities to refugees from around the world is one of the finest examples of the Canadian spirit. Canada has welcomed countless individuals and families who were once forcibly uprooted from their homes, but are now thriving members of Canadian society. Under a Conservative government, with fair, orderly, and compassionate immigration, refugee, and asylum systems, we can do more to help the world’s most vulnerable.
“This World Refugee Day, let us remember the hardships that refugees around the world have endured, and let us celebrate Canada, where so many of those refugees have found freedom, peace and the rule of law.”

New Conservative government to make it easier for volunteers to qualify for tax credits recognizing their service 
A new Conservative government will allow more search and rescue volunteers and volunteer firefighters to qualify for tax savings, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today. 
“Communities across Canada rely on
volunteers for essential services like fire protection and search and rescue,”
Scheer said. “These are people of courage, character, and strength who step up
when their neighbours need it most, often at significant personal expense. A
new Conservative government will recognize this service and sacrifice by making
it easier for them to qualify for tax savings so they can get ahead.”
A new Conservative government will put
more money back in the pockets of these hometown heroes by reducing the number
of service hours required to qualify for federal tax credits from 200 to 150
hours per year.
Volunteers
often pay out-of-pocket for equipment, uniforms, transportation, training, and
insurance – costs that run into the thousands of dollars. 
Volunteers
will continue to receive a $450 rebate every year. The Parliamentary Budget
Officer estimates that lowering the number of required hours by 50 will allow more
than 5,000 additional volunteers to apply for and receive these benefits. 
Scheer
made today’s announcement in New Brunswick, where volunteer search and rescue
teams have been active for more than 35 years. Upper Kingsclear also relies on volunteer
firefighters for its protection, several of whom were on hand for today’s announcement.
 “A new Conservative government will live
within its means and put more money back in your pockets – for you, for your
family, and your retirement,” Scheer said. 
FACTS:
Last
year, the National Fire Protection Association reports that of the 152,650 local firefighters
in Canada from 2014-16, 126,650 (83 per cent) were volunteers. That same report
found that of 3,672 fire departments in Canada, 3,061 are all-volunteer.The
Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada (SARVAC) says 9,000 volunteers serve on 300 search and
rescue teams across the country. All told, these volunteers contribute more
than 600,000 hours of training, administration, and searches each year.The
previous Conservative government introduced the Volunteer Firefighter Tax Credit
in Budget 2011 and the Search and Rescue Volunteer Tax
Credit in Budget 2014.In
2016, nearly 43,000 individuals claimed the Volunteer Firefighter Tax Credit
and 4,800 individuals claimed the Search and Rescue Volunteer Tax Credit.Justin
Trudeau has done nothing with these tax credits and nothing for these
volunteers.

Investment will reduce wait times for potentially life-saving scans 
A new Conservative government will invest $1.5 billion in its
first term to purchase MRI machines and CT machines to replace aging equipment and
add machines across the country, reducing wait times for potentially
life-saving tests for Canadians, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“Hundreds of thousands of Canadians wait longer than the recommended
time for an MRI or a CT scan. That is just not good enough”, said Scheer. “This
investment will help our health care providers to deliver quality services with
the most up-to-date technology, giving patients quicker access to reliable,
potentially life-saving tests.”
Justin Trudeau’s never-ending deficits and out-of-control
spending have put Canada on track to hit $1 trillion in debt by 2035. If
Trudeau is given four more years, his debt and never-ending deficits will
threaten our ability to deliver quality public services like health and social
programs.
A
new Conservative government will live within its means to protect health care
in the long term. As written in a letter to all Premiers in August 2019, as
Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will maintain and increase the current funding
formula for the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer. 
“Canadians need a government that understands that balancing the budget is the best way to maintain the services that they rely on the most, including health care,” Scheer said. “Canada’s Conservatives will give you more help for your health, so you can get ahead.”
FACTS:
Justin Trudeau said he would balance the budget
by 2019. Instead, he has raised taxes, imposed a carbon tax, and his massive overspending
now puts health and social programs at risk.According to a recent report
by the Conference
Board of Canada, Canada’s stock of MRI and CT
machines is aging, supply is not keeping up with demand, and wait times for
these important diagnostic tests exceed the wait-time recommendations from the
Canadian Association of Radiologists. By upgrading and increasing available
medical imaging equipment, Canadians will have better, faster access to quality
tests. Getting earlier access to a test could mean an earlier diagnosis for the
patient. In addition to improving wait
times, this investment will also give provincial governments some additional
spending flexibility, as the federal government would pick up the bill for
replacing out-of-date imaging equipment that the provinces would likely have to
replace. Demand for medical imaging
tests is only expected to increase as our population ages.

$2/litre gasoline is just around the corner
New research from the Conservative Party of
Canada reveals Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax increase will hit Canadians hard,
adding hundreds of dollars to their bottom line.
Trudeau’s environment minister Catherine McKenna just
recently revealed the Trudeau Liberal’s hidden agenda
to increase their Carbon Tax.
Canadians are now wondering just how high it will go – and
what it will mean for their bank accounts.
We did the math.
The carbon tax right now sits at $20/tonne and will have
to go up to $100/tonne after 2022, and as high as  $300/tonne by
2050 for the Liberals to reach their environment targets. The Parliamentary
Budget Officer confirmed the carbon tax would have to be $102/tonne to meet the
targets.
Given Trudeau has confirmed a carbon tax hike is on the
table, the Conservative Party has conducted research to determine just how much
it would cost the average Canadian household.
At the PBO’s $102/tonne level Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would:
Increase the cost of natural gas for an average household by $469 a yearAdd 31 cents/litre to the price of gasoline.
That means $2/litre gasoline is just around the corner if
the Trudeau Liberals are re-elected. At the end of the day, it’s Canadians who
will bear the cost of Justin Trudeau’s taxes as the price of every day
essentials are increased:
In Ontario, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,151.In New Brunswick, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $959.In Manitoba, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,116.In Saskatchewan, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,930.In Alberta, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $2,002.
“Justin Trudeau has proven that he can’t be trusted to
help Canadians get ahead,” said Pierre Poilievre, MP for Carleton. “If he’s
given four more years, his carbon tax will cost Canadians thousands of dollars
more every year. Life is expensive enough for Canadian families without Justin
Trudeau costing them even more.”
Poilievre highlighted Trudeau’s Carbon Tax increase at
Abby Hill Farms, a country market in Ottawa that has been hit hard by the
carbon tax.
Having campaigned in 2015 to offer “real help to Canada’s
middle class and all those working hard to join it,” Trudeau is instead making
life more difficult for the very families he promised to support.
“Only Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have a plan to live within our means and put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead,” Poilievre said.

NOVEMBER 9, 2019
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“Today, Canada joins our friends and allies in marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
“Built by the Communist government of East Germany, the so-called German Democratic Republic, the Berlin Wall physically divided Berlin for 28 years from 1961 to 1989, serving as a physical reminder of where communism ended and freedom began. Built to imprison East Germans and keep them captive to their socialist system, it quickly became one of the most notorious symbols of the “Iron Curtain”, dividing not only East and West Germany, but also eastern and western Europe.
“Approximately 5,000 East Germans managed to escape across the Berlin Wall to freedom, but sadly, another 5,000 were captured by the Stasi and 191 individuals were killed during their attempts to cross the wall.
“Thirty years ago today, thousands of East Germans bravely took to the streets to tear down the wall that symbolized the tyranny of communism and separated many from their family, friends and the free world. A wave of democratization swept through Eastern Europe in 1989, and the widespread discontent with the failures of communism, combined with a deep desire for liberty, drove the fall of the Berlin Wall and the pursuit of political and economic freedom for all Europeans.  
“Today, we also remember the one million members of the Canadian Forces and their families that were stationed in NATO bases across Western Europe, many of them serving at CFB Lahr and CFB Baden-Soellingen. In remembrance of our brave soldiers, the German government presented a piece of the Berlin Wall to Canada, which Prime Minister Stephen Harper placed in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa in 2009 for permanent display. Let us never forget the Canadian and Allied heroes who served in the Cold War, defending democracy and fundamental human rights.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I encourage all Canadians to learn about and remember the history of the Berlin Wall, the Cold War, and Canada’s valiant role in the Allied victory.”

Conservative plan takes real action to fight crime vs. Trudeau’s do-nothing gun ban
A new Conservative government will take real
action to fight gang and gun violence, combat human trafficking, and tackle
drug addictions and recovery, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced
today.
“As Prime Minister, I will lead a government that
honours its most sacred duty – to keep its citizens and their streets safe,”
Scheer said. “Justin Trudeau has failed in this regard and all of his proposed
measures to fight crime simply will not work. Canadians can’t trust him to keep
them safe.”  
The Conservative plan for safer streets targets
illegal firearms crossing the border and ending up with gangsters, while
strengthening penalties to keep gang and gun criminals behind bars.  
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer’s plan for A
Safer Canada will: 
End automatic bail
for gang members awaiting trial and revoke parole for any gang member who
associates with their former gang following release.
Identify known
gangs as criminal entities in the Criminal Code, similar to how terrorist
organizations are currently listed.
Bring in tougher
sentences, including a five-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for violent
gang crime, with a new five-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for
possession of a smuggled firearm. 
Create a Canada
Border Services Agency firearms smuggling task force to intercept illegal
firearms at the Canada-US border.
Strengthen
background checks for gun licenses and make it a crime to provide a firearm to
anyone who has been prohibited from owning them. 
Revise the
Canadian drugs and substance strategy to focus on helping Canadians recover
from addiction.
Strengthen human trafficking laws, including consecutive sentences for
those who are convicted on multiple counts of human trafficking and ensuring
Canada meets our commitments under the Palermo Protocol. 
Scheer contrasted the detailed Conservative plan
with Trudeau’s vague firearms ban that will do nothing to crack down on gun
crime.
“Forcing law-abiding Canadians to follow even
more laws will not reduce crime,” Scheer said. “Criminals don’t follow laws and
that’s exactly why we have to target them. My plan does the hard work of
tracking down criminals and putting them behind bars where they belong so you
and your family can be safe and get ahead.”
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs. Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50%, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of families who make green-home improvements.

A new Conservative government would take measures to safeguard against abuse of power
In Justin Trudeau’s
riding of Papineau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today that a
new Conservative government would launch a judicial inquiry into the
SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.
A new Conservative government will also introduce the No More Cover-Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access information protected by cabinet confidence by making an application to the Supreme Court of Canada. This will prevent corrupt politicians from hiding behind cabinet confidence to escape police investigation. 
As confirmed by
hours of Parliamentary testimony, taped conversations, and an Ethics
Commissioner’s guilty verdict, Trudeau politically interfered in SNC-Lavalin’s
criminal prosecution by trying to “circumvent, undermine, and ultimately attempt
to discredit” former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould.
However, to
this day, Trudeau refuses to waive cabinet confidence, keeping important
details of the scandal secret and preventing several key witnesses, including
Ms. Wilson-Raybould, from disclosing evidence.
“Justin Trudeau
has covered up his role in the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal every step of the
way,” Scheer said. “He blocked three Parliamentary investigations, refused to
co-operate with the Ethics Commissioner, and is currently blocking the RCMP
from obtaining key evidence. As Prime Minister, I will call a judicial inquiry
so Canadians can finally get the answers they deserve.”
“No longer will
a corrupt Prime Minister be able to be the gatekeeper of his own misconduct,”
said Scheer. “These measures will safeguard our democracy against the whims of
sleazy and unscrupulous politicians. Justin Trudeau has so far avoided
consequence for the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal, but the Canadian people
will deliver their verdict on October 21.” 
FACTS: 
In
2017, Justin Trudeau became the first Prime Minister in Canadian history to be
found guilty of breaking ethics laws for accepting a vacation from a lobbyist.
In August, he was found guilty again for his role in the SNC-Lavalin corruption
scandal.Trudeau
abused the power of his office to shut down two separate Ethics Committee
investigations and a Justice Committee investigation.In
his final report, Trudeau II, Ethics
Commissioner Mario Dion noted, “During this examination, nine witnesses
informed our Office that they had information they believed to be relevant, but
that could not be disclosed because, according to them, this information would
reveal a confidence of the Queen’s Privy Council and would fall outside the
scope of Order in Council 2019-0105.”Right
before the election, Canadians learned the RCMP is being prevented from
investigating possible obstruction of justice because Trudeau refuses to waive
cabinet confidence.

New Conservative government to repeal Trudeau tax increases and reduce red tape
Small
business owners can look forward to a new Conservative government repealing
Justin Trudeau’s tax increases and cutting red tape, announced Andrew Scheer at
Cracker Jack’s Bar and Grill today. 
“Justin
Trudeau thinks small businesses are tax cheats, “said Scheer. “In the last four
years, it has become more expensive than ever to run a business. Trudeau’s
Carbon Tax raised the price of gasoline and heating, making it harder to pay
monthly bills. His payroll tax hikes hurt the bottom line, and his
unprecedented tax hike on small businesses in 2017 – although Canada’s
Conservatives and business leaders came together to try to stop it – ended up
costing small businesses even more.” 
The government
should not stand in the way and make life more difficult for those trying to
make a living and grow their business. 
Not
only are small businesses victim to the Trudeau government’s tax hikes, small
businesses across the country are also struggling under a massive regulatory
burden. Justin Trudeau has imposed more than 4,300 job-killing, growth-choking
federal regulations on Canadian business since 2015. 
A
new Conservative government will take several measures to support our small
businesses: 
Repeal
Trudeau’s tax increases on small business investments Exempt
spouses from Trudeau’s tax increases on small business dividends Make
it easier to navigate Canada’s tax system and the Canada Revenue AgencyReduce
federal regulations by 25 per centImplement
a 2-for-1 rule for new regulations Assign
a Minister reporting directly to the Prime Minister to lead red tape reduction
effortsMandate
ministers and regulators to support innovation, economic growth, and global
competitiveness Champion
Canada’s small businesses to the world  
“A
new Conservative government will continue to celebrate small businesses as
drivers of prosperity, and not view them merely as sources of revenue,” said
Scheer. “It’s time to stop Justin Trudeau’s attacks on small business owners.
It is time for Canada’s small businesses to get ahead.”
FACTS:
Of
the 95,000 businesses that are created in Canada each year, barely 50 per cent
will survive to celebrate their tenth anniversary. Over the last four years, it
has become more difficult than ever to start and grow a business.In
2017, Trudeau proposed a disastrous set of small business tax increases that
were only partially abandoned because of effective pressure by Canada’s
Conservatives and massive public outcry.Trudeau
tried to hike taxes on small businesses’ investment income to 73 per cent, and
then went after small business owners’ spouses, ending a long-standing tax
exemption on dividend payments. The
Canadian Chamber of Commerce (CCC) reports there were 131,754 federal regulations
on the books when Justin Trudeau took office in 2015. Public policy think-tank
MEI reports that by 2018, the number of federal
regulations rose to 136,121 – an increase of more than 4,300.In
late 2018, the Financial Post reported that regulatory burden was
“killing Canada’s competitiveness.”

Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost      of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an      average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your      family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit,      saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Regina, SK – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition issued the following statement on Justin Trudeau’s failure to get an exemption from the latest Buy American rules:
 “Justin Trudeau failed Canadians by surrendering so much and getting pushed-around by President Trump during the NAFTA re-negotiations, and now we are seeing it happen once again with the United States’ Executive Order on Buy America.
 “When Justin Trudeau had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to negotiate a better deal for Canadians, he gave up concession after concession to Donald Trump without securing anything in return. Canada’s hard-working steel and manufacturing workers are now paying the price.
 “Just last week, Canada’s Premiers came together to call-on the Trudeau government to secure Canadian exemptions from Buy America policies. We have already seen the damage these Buy America policies can cause, and even though the Premiers raised their concerns, things have gotten worse.
 “Justin Trudeau promised that Canada would be respected on the world-stage, but clearly he is Not as Advertised. It’s obvious that our trading partners see Justin Trudeau as a weak leader who will be pushed-around every step of the way on the world stage.
 “A Conservative Government will always fight for Canadian workers, and unlike Justin Trudeau and the Liberals, we will stand firm in defence of Canadian interests.”

A new Conservative government would engage new strategies, partnerships
and provide funding to support critical industry
Alfie MacLeod, Conservative Candidate for Cape Breton
– Canso, and Eddie Orrell, Conservative Candidate for Sydney – Victoria, were
in Glace Bay today to speak with local fish harvesters about Andrew Scheer’s
plan to promote and support Canada’s fisheries by adopting new strategies and
partnerships to strengthen relationships and build consensus on how to restore
fish stocks. Similar announcements were made by Conservative candidates across
the country.
“The Trudeau Liberals have failed to consult fish
harvesters over the past four years and this has had a real impact on our
coastal communities,” said Alfie MacLeod. “Livelihoods throughout our
province depend on the fishery. 
Conservatives will work with Nova Scotians to strengthen this vital
resource.”
To renew engagement and consultation to support our
fisheries, a new Conservative government will:
Create advisory panels with fish harvesters and anglers, Indigenous groups, and other experts
as appropriate, to rebuild critical stocks and ensure that everyone is working
together. Enhance and rebuild wild Atlantic and Pacific salmon stocks by increasing support for community-led conservation and enhancement
projects and increasing the price of the Salmon Conservation Stamp for
non-residents to benefit the Pacific Salmon Foundation.Complete new recovery
plans for all of Canada’s critical fisheries and develop strategies for managing
predators and invasive species where necessary.Repeal measures that
bypass community consultations for Marine Protected Areas while ensuring that the process is robust and timely. Justin Trudeau’s changes have short
circuited important community consultations for Marine Protected Areas. Work with industry to
develop a strategy for preventing seafood fraud.Create a modern
aquaculture act.Support the advancement
of technology and practices that reduce contact between wild and farmed salmon.
“It is so important to note the important role that
fisheries play in our local economies,” said Alfie MacLeod. “To maintain
infrastructure and support communities, a new Conservative government will provide $250 million in additional support for small craft harbours.”
Supporting our fisheries is also an important part of A
Real Plan to Protect Our Environment. As part of our
efforts to combat oceans plastic, a new Conservative government will work with
international partners to reduce the prevalence of “ghost gear”, or abandoned
and lost gear, which entangles marine wildlife and contributes to the world’s
oceans’ plastic problem. We will work to protect our oceans against one of the
deadliest forms of marine litter.
“A new Conservative government will support our fishing
industry to ensure our local communities and economies continue to thrive,”
said Eddie Orrell. “These are necessary measures – strategies, partnerships,
and funding – to make sure this critical industry continues to thrive.”
Andrew
Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives: “Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.

A new Conservative government will fund projects that get Canadians home faster, reduce commute times
A new Conservative government will fund the Ontario Line and Yonge
Subway Extension projects as part of a plan to prioritize projects that get
Canadians home faster, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension are two great
examples of projects that reduce commute times and relieve traffic congestion
for hard-working commuters,” Scheer said.
“These are exactly the kinds of infrastructure projects a new
Conservative government will prioritize and I’m pleased to announce that as
Prime Minister, my government will fund them.” 
The 7.4-kilometre Yonge Subway
Extension will connect Toronto to Markham, Vaughan and Richmond Hill – one of
the fastest growing regions in Ontario. The 15-kilometre Ontario Line will
increase capacity by 30 per cent on a critically needed east-west and
north-south route. 
Scheer was joined by Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti and Richmond
Hill Mayor David Barrow and pointed out that despite a $187 billion infrastructure
spending commitment, Justin Trudeau has failed to deliver much-needed commuter
infrastructure for Canadians.
“Justin Trudeau was elected on a promise to invest in
infrastructure and get these kinds of projects built. But four years later, he
has spent the money but has nothing to show for it. We got the deficits without
the infrastructure,” Scheer said. “Once again, he is not as advertised.”
Only Canada’s Conservatives have a plan to lower your taxes and
put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead. We will build the
desperately needed infrastructure Canadians need to get home faster at the end
of the day.
FACTS:
Commute times in Toronto are
up an
average of almost 8 per cent since 2013, with
an average commute of 42 minutes.The Ontario Line is estimated
to cost $10.9 billion and is scheduled to be complete by 2027.The Yonge Subway Extension is
estimated to cost $5.6 billion and should be operational right after the
Ontario Line opens. A new Conservative government
would fund projects that reduce commute times across the country like the George
Massey Tunnel replacement project in Vancouver and the third link across the
Saint Lawrence River in Québec City.According to the Parliamentary
Budget Officer (PBO), for every dollar
Justin Trudeau promised for infrastructure, he only spent 60 cents: “the
Government failed to spend about 40 per cent of its planned infrastructure
budget.” Analysis
showed that for all his spending, there are no substantial results to show for
it.In its analysis of Budget 2018,
the PBO reported:
“Budget 2018 provides an incomplete account of the changes to the Government’s
$186.7 billion infrastructure spending plan. PBO requested the new plan but it
does not exist.”If given four more years,
Justin Trudeau’s debt and never-ending deficits will delay badly needed
infrastructure, threatening the future of important projects like the Ontario
Line and Yonge Subway Extension, and doing nothing to reduce commute times.Trudeau’s Carbon tax will add
31 cents a litre to the price of gas, adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of
everyday essentials. In Ontario, his carbon tax will cost you over a thousand
dollars each and every year.

A new Conservative government will put more money in your pocket for you and your family.
When Canadians go to the polls on Oct. 21,
only the Conservative Party of Canada will have a trustworthy plan to put more
money in your pockets so you can get ahead.
Today, Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives,
officially launched the Conservative Party’s election campaign with a clear
plan to help all Canadians whose lives have gotten more expensive under Justin
Trudeau and the Liberals.
“Canadians are working harder and harder, but they’re just
barely getting by and just can’t seem to get ahead. I’m running to be Prime
Minister with a clear plan to make life more affordable for you and your
family,” said Scheer.
Scheer highlighted that after four years, Justin Trudeau’s
huge deficits, mounting debt, tax hikes, and broken promises have left Canadian
families worse off. Under Trudeau, 80% of middle-income families have seen
their federal taxes increase by $800 or more per year.
“Justin Trudeau was elected on a promise to help the
middle class. But the last four years have shown he is just not as advertised,”
said Scheer. “Instead of ‘sunny ways’ and ‘real change,’ you got four years of
higher gas prices, massive deficits, mounting debt, and a carbon tax that makes
everyday essentials more expensive.”
Scheer added, “Four more years of Justin Trudeau is four
more years of deficits that threaten our health care and education systems, a
higher carbon tax on gas, groceries and home heating, and four more years of
weakness on the world stage, scandals, and cover ups.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Take the GST off home heating costsScrap the Trudeau Carbon TaxMake maternity benefits tax-freeCreate better, higher paying jobs by embracing nation building projects at home, while standing up for Canadian workers on the world stage.
“I’m a kid that grew up in a townhouse, in a family that
didn’t own a car, whose mother lived with her eight siblings in a two-bedroom
house on a dirt road, and today I am running to be Prime Minister. That’s the
kind of opportunity Canada offered me. I want Canada to be that place for
everyone,” Scheer said.

A new Conservative government will prioritize critical
infrastructure projects that shorten commute times like the George Massey
Tunnel replacement in the Greater Vancouver Area, Conservative Leader Andrew
Scheer announced today.
“Canadians are sick and tired of being stuck in traffic and
waiting for delayed public transit,” said Scheer. “Canada’s Conservatives will

times for everyone, whether you drive or catch public transit.”
Examples of the type of projects that would be prioritized for
funding include:
The George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project (British Columbia)The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension (Ontario)The third link between Quebec City and Levis (Québec)
Scheer pointed out how, despite making a $187-billion
infrastructure spending commitment in the 2015 election, Justin Trudeau has
failed to deliver important projects for Canadian commuters.
“He’s made billions in promises but hasn’t delivered. When it
comes to getting shovels in the ground and getting projects built, Justin

infrastructure spending by scrapping Justin Trudeau’s $35-billion Infrastructure
Bank which has been nothing but a waste of taxpayer dollars, adding countless

infrastructure projects that have already been committed to will move forward. Going
forward, a new Conservative government will have a strategy in place to prioritize
future transportation projects on whether they lower commute times and also provide
more housing options for Canadians.”
FACTS:
Statistics Canada found that 1.5
million Canadians spent at least an hour commuting to work in 2016.According to the Parliamentary
Budget Officer (PBO), for every dollar
Justin Trudeau promised for infrastructure, he only spent 60 cents: “the
Government failed to spend about 40 per cent of its planned infrastructure
budget.” Analysis
showed that for all his spending, there are no substantial results to show for
it.In its analysis of Budget 2018,
the PBO reported:
“Budget 2018 provides an incomplete account of the changes to the Government’s
$186.7 billion infrastructure spending plan. PBO requested the new plan but it
does not exist.”If given four more years,
Justin Trudeau’s debt and never-ending deficits will delay badly needed
infrastructure, threatening the future of important projects like the George
Massey Tunnel replacement. 
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up      to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESP’s by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians for green home improvements.

Liberals not as advertised on Canada’s Veterans
The Conservative Party today released a manifesto by
Liberal MP and candidate for Don Valley West, Rob Oliphant, in which he bemoans
Remembrance Day as something “used to
promote the remilitarization of Canada,” and “continue towards becoming a
national war-machine.”
Oliphant explains how “conflicted” he is about Remembrance Day and
his belief that it tends to “glorify war.” 
If it isn’t shame for Remembrance Day like that which Mr. Oliphant
has, it’s lying to Veterans and telling them they’re asking for more than the
Liberals can give, like Justin Trudeau infamously told one Veteran. 
Liberals clearly have a problem with the men and women that have
served in Canada’s military, and a problem showing them the respect they
deserve.
Unlike the Trudeau Liberals, the Andrew Scheer Conservatives know
our Veterans are heroes. They dedicated their lives to protecting us.  Now it is our responsibility to respect their
service by doing our part to look out for them.
Under the Liberals, the number of Veterans stranded on a waitlist
for financial support had ballooned to over 40,000 people – an increase of
11,000 over the previous year.
Only Andrew Scheer and Canada’s Conservatives treat Veterans with
respect and deliver the supports they need in a timely manner, all enshrined in
law through a just announced legislated Military Covenant, found here https://www.conservative.ca/andrew-scheer-promises-more-support-for-canadas-veterans/
Justin Trudeau and Rob Oliphant should feel absolutely ashamed of not just their own record on Veterans and Veterans support, but now their anti-Remembrance Day position.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Lac-Mégantic, QC – Luc Berthold, Conservative Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Agri-Food, released the following statement outlining expectations of the Trudeau government ahead of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Federal-Provincial-Territorial Agriculture Ministers in Quebec City:
 “Justin Trudeau’s Minister of Agriculture Marie-Claude Bibeau promised Canadian milk, egg and poultry farmers that a compensation plan would be in place by June 30th, but the Liberals have blown past their own deadline and failed to deliver any of the $3.9 billion farmers are counting on. Sadly, this comes as no surprise since the Liberals have been failing our agriculture sector for the last four years – raising taxes, making concessions to Donald Trump during NAFTA negotiations, failing to stand up for Canada when China banned meat, soy and canola seed exports, and leaving our farmers with greater uncertainty.
 “With the election three months away, the Trudeau government would rather play politics and delay compensation for their re-election campaign than deliver on their promises. Justin Trudeau must finally release the compensation details promised to Canadian farmers so they can finally receive the support they need. Our farmers can’t afford to wait any longer and they need certainty now.
 “Given Minister Bibeau has the second highest number of dairy farmers in her riding in the country, she should understand how her government’s failures are hurting Canadian farmers. Anything less than a fully-detailed compensation plan is unacceptable.
 “A Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer will always stand up for milk, egg and poultry farmers and ensure they receive the support they deserve.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues the following statement on the Anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising:
“Today
marks the 75th Anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, which began on August 1, 1944
and lasted 63 days. The uprising by the Polish underground resistance, led by
the Polish Home Army, was a brave effort to liberate Poland’s capital from
German occupation. Though the uprising was ultimately defeated, for those
63 days, Canada’s Polish friends and allies fought the German Army, inflicting
numerous losses of troops and resources. 
“Today we
pay tribute to the people of Warsaw, both the combatants and the civilian
population, who demonstrated an inexhaustible willingness to sacrifice all to
preserve their freedom, independence, and the right to a sovereign future.
“On behalf
of Canada’s Conservatives, I encourage all Canadians to learn more about the
history of World War II and the sacrifices made by the ‘greatest generation’ in
defeating tyranny.”

A new Conservative government would put $4,000 in new parents’ pockets  
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives, spoke to new parents about his plan to help Canadians get ahead
by making maternity benefits tax-free.
“It’s young people – starting their careers and starting
their families – who pay the most tax and are hit hardest by government tax
increases,” Scheer said. “I hear that you have jobs, you’re working hard, but
you’re just getting by, and you’re definitely not getting ahead.”
“Only Conservatives can be trusted to make life easier and
more affordable for you and for your family,” said Scheer. “Making maternity
benefits tax-free will put $4,000 back in your pocket so you can focus on your
newborn and not worry too much about your bottom line or bank balance.”
Right now, in Canada, more than 80 per cent of
middle-income families are paying $800 more in taxes a year than they did in
2015. In 2018, the Trudeau Liberals and the NDP cost Canadian families hundreds
of millions of dollars by refusing to support a Conservative bill to support
young families.
“Conservatives believe parents are best placed to make the
decisions that are right for them and their family,” said Scheer. “Only
Canada’s Conservatives can be trusted to leave more money in your pocket so you
and your family can get ahead. It’s time for you to get ahead.”
FACTS:
In 2018, the Liberals and the NDP cost Canadian parents hundreds of millions of dollars in savings when they voted against a Conservative bill, introduced by Andrew Scheer, that would have brought immediate tax relief to families.Families of all income levels and anyone that pays into employment insurance will be eligible for this new benefit.A new Conservative government will provide a tax credit of an equivalent amount for residents of Quebec who receive benefits under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP).

Yesterday, the NDP let the cat out of the

Canadians don’t elect a Conservative majority government on Oct. 21.
When asked about it today, Trudeau did not rule out a

Trudeau as Prime Minister.
With Trudeau forced to rely on the NDP to hang on to
power, what will that mean for you?
An even higher carbon tax. Trudeau is already planning to hike
     the carbon tax if he’s re-elected. But to keep the NDP happy, he’ll have
     to hike it even higher.
      Fewer jobs. NDP economic policies fail
     everywhere they’ve been tried. With the NDP calling the shots, Trudeau

      Even bigger deficits. To meet the NDP’s demands, Trudeau
     will have to spend billions more than he was already planning to, racking
     up huge deficits that will threaten social programs like health care.
Justin Trudeau will pay any price to stay in power. And
it’s your money he will pay with.
There’s only one way for Canadians to stop this coalition

In the face of scandal, Trudeau reveals platform, making billions in farcical promises to Canadians  
In
an attempt to cover up international embarrassment, Justin Trudeau has revealed
his platform, announcing a staggering $57 billion in campaign promises. The
tally of his disastrous campaign is mounting, and so is his debt. 
“Justin
Trudeau will do or say anything to get re-elected. If given four more years, we
know that Trudeau is going to raise your taxes to pay for his out of control
spending,” said Pierre Poilievre, MP Carleton at a media availability in
Ottawa.
To
reveal the true cost of Justin Trudeau’s poor judgement, the Conservative Party
has once again done the math:
Justin
Trudeau’s campaign promises added to his existing deficits will pile on $100
billion of new debt to the books; His
deficit will hit $27.4 billion in 2020; and, Total
debt by the end of Justin Trudeau’s second term would be over $800 billion.  
What
does that mean for you? Justin Trudeau’s never-ending spending will threaten
the quality of our health and social programs. He will be forced to raise taxes
to pay for his endless debt and deficits. 
To
pay just half of Justin Trudeau’s deficits ($14B), he would have to either:
Raise
the GST by 2% or; Raise
the rate on the first income tax bracket from 15% to 19% or;Raise
the rate on the second income tax bracket from 20.5% to 27% or; Lower
the basic personal amount from $12,069 to $6,869. 
Further,
by reaching $823 billion in total debt, Trudeau is will spend $35 billion on
interest payments alone. That’s $35 billion that will not go to Canadians’
priorities.
Justin
Trudeau campaigned on a promise to help the middle class. Instead, he raised
taxes on 80 per cent of middle-class Canadians and imposed a carbon tax that
makes everyday essential more expensive. If Justin Trudeau is re-elected, his
carbon tax is going to increase the price of gasoline by 31 cents per litre. 
“This
election will come down to the choice between a government who thinks they can
spend your money better than you, raises taxes, and makes your life more
unaffordable – and a new Conservative government that will lower your taxes and
put more money in your pocket,” said Poilievre. 
JUSTIN
TRUDEAU’S BROKEN PROMISES: 
Balanced
Budgets: 
“I
am looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way I always have. We’ve
said we are committed to balanced budgets and we are. We will balance that
budget in 2019.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
It’s
2019, and as we can see the budget did not “balance itself.” Justin Trudeau is
running endless deficits that threaten the social services Canadians depend on
and if re-elected Trudeau will just raise your taxes to pay for his out of
control spending. 
Electoral
Reform: 
“As
Prime Minister, I’ll make sure the 2015 election will be the last under
first-past-the-post system.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
There’s
another election, and guess what? It’s being held under first-past-the-post. 
Veterans:

“Our
plan will give back to those who have given so much in service to all
Canadians, and will ensure that no veteran has to fight the government for the
support and compensation they have earned.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015
Election Platform
Justin
Trudeau looked a military hero in the eye – a man who lost his leg fighting for
our country – and said that veterans are “asking for more than we are able to
give.” 
Accountability:

“We
will restore trust in our democracy.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election
Platform
Justin
Trudeau was the first Prime Minister in our country’s history to be found
guilty of breaking ethics laws, and he did it not once but twice! 
Justin
Trudeau has stonewalled the Ethics Commissioner, shut-down parliamentary
committees search for answers into Liberal corruption scandals, and he is now
doing everything in his power to block the RCMP from investigating his office.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues statement to mark World Refugee Day:
“Today on World Refugee Day we call to mind the plight of refugees and displaced people and celebrate Canada as a beacon of hope and land of refuge.
“Refugees and the displaced overcome countless challenges to flee sometimes horrific persecution and hardship. Leaving their homes and homelands behind, they have to demonstrate extraordinary resilience and bravery to begin their new lives in our free and open country.
“This is an opportunity to reflect on one of the most significant challenges facing humanity. Today, we are witnessing very high numbers of people either internally displaced or seeking refuge or asylum. Persecution, conflict, and instability have forced an unprecedented number of people, mostly children, out of their homes and communities and into the unknown.
“The economic, political, and social challenges that have led to displacement around the world are not lost on Canadians – whether it’s in the Middle East where Yazidis and Christians have been brutally persecuted for their religious beliefs, or in Venezuela where a corrupt and oppressive government has forced its citizens to seek a new home simply to survive, or the Rohingya people who have been denied citizenship in their native Myanmar and forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.
“The generosity of Canadians opening their homes and communities to refugees from around the world is one of the finest examples of the Canadian spirit. Canada has welcomed countless individuals and families who were once forcibly uprooted from their homes, but are now thriving members of Canadian society. Under a Conservative government, with fair, orderly, and compassionate immigration, refugee, and asylum systems, we can do more to help the world’s most vulnerable.
“This World Refugee Day, let us remember the hardships that refugees around the world have endured, and let us celebrate Canada, where so many of those refugees have found freedom, peace and the rule of law.”

approve the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion:
 
“Today’s cabinet approval of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion will come as
no surprise. This will, in fact, be the third time the Liberals approve this
project. Approving it for a third time is meaningless.
 
“The question is when will it get built. The Liberals still have absolutely no
plan for construction.
 
“After approving it for the first time in 2016, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals
failed to demonstrate the leadership and political will to get it built.
 
“So, with the project in jeopardy, the government purchased it with $4.5
billion in taxpayer dollars. This sent a message to the world that the only way
to get a big project built in Canada is to have the government nationalize it.
 
“Despite these approvals, not a single inch of new pipeline has been laid and
not a single ounce of dirt has been moved. These delays have cost Canadians
billions in economic activity.
 
“Today’s cabinet decision gets us no closer to having this vital, job-creating
protect than we were when it was first approved two and a half years ago.
 
“Justin Trudeau has said he wants to “phase out” Canada’s oil and gas sector.
For once, all is going according to his plan.
 
“Fortunately, Canada’s Conservatives have a plan to get pipelines built.
 
“We will cancel the Trudeau carbon tax, repeal the No-More-Pipelines Bill C-69
and Oil-Export-Ban Bill C-48, establish clear timelines for approvals,
eliminate foreign interference in the approvals process, and invoke federal
jurisdiction when necessary.”

It’s not surprising that Trudeau is running from his
record of disastrous foreign policy decisions, embarrassing behaviour, and
refusal to stand up for Canada’s interests against hostile foreign powers. 
When Justin Trudeau was first elected in 2015 he
proclaimed that Canada was back. Instead, he has diminished Canada’s role on
the world stage by:
Pulling our troops out of the fight against ISIS and
initially refusing to acknowledge the genocide being committed by the Islamic
State;Damaging relations with Canada’s allies like Japan and
Australia;Embarrassing Canadians by bringing a known terrorist

four years failing Canada’s agriculture sector.
 
“This trend of failure by the Trudeau Liberals should alarm Canada’s
supply-managed farmers and Canada’s agriculture sector. Not only has Canada
lost market access to China for meat, soy and canola seed, but Minister Bibeau
has failed to present a real plan for Canada’s supply-managed farmers. It is
clear than Justin Trudeau’s support for Canada’s milk, egg, and poultry farmers
is not as advertised.
 
“Canada’s milk, egg, and poultry farmers deserve a transparent compensation plan
from the Trudeau Liberals, not a re-election plan.
 
“A Conservative government, led by Prime Minister Andrew Scheer, will continue
to stand up for milk, egg, and poultry farmers and ensure farm families get the
respect they deserve.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issued the following statement on Global Coptic Day:
“Today, Coptic Christians in Canada and across the world will gather with friends and family to celebrate the first Global Coptic Day. Coptic Christians have successfully preserved their rich faith and tradition throughout the centuries, despite facing much oppression and mistreatment.
“Today is also the feast day marking the Entry of Jesus Christ into Egypt, during the Holy Family’s flight from the persecution of King Herod. Proudly maintaining their identity as the descendants of the original people of Egypt who converted to Christianity, the Coptic community to this day cherishes the memory of the Egyptian exile of Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
“The Coptic community have themselves known persecution and martyrdom, the ultimate witness to their faithfulness to Jesus. Even in recent years there have been multiple instances of horrific attacks against Copts, who were targeted simply because they are Christian. This is completely unacceptable.
“Canada is blessed to be a land of freedom. Canada’s Conservatives will always support religious freedom and stand up for the fundamental right of everyone to practice their religion.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to all Coptic Canadians celebrating Global Coptic Day!”

Conservatives plan to increase health care transfers to the provinces by at least 3% per year
When it comes to improving Canada’s health
care system, Canadians can only trust a Conservative Government led by Prime
Minister Andrew Scheer. Justin Trudeau is simply not as advertised.
Under a Conservative government, funding for health care
will increase by at least 3% every single year, and we will maintain additional
Shared Health Priorities funding for mental health and home care for provinces.
We will make major investments in new medical equipment
and introduce a National Autism Strategy. Andrew Scheer is also committed to
working with provinces to ensure that Canadians with rare diseases have access
to the treatments that they need.
Unfortunately Canadians cannot trust Justin Trudeau. The
media have already reported that Justin Trudeau’s health care promises won’t fill the
gaps in Canada’s health care system. What’s worse Trudeau’s reckless
deficits will force him to cut health care spending. In fact, in the 1990s,
Liberals cut health care
spending by nearly 40%, cuts Trudeau said he
supported.
Given that Trudeau has historically supported deep health
care cuts, it’s no surprise that he cut health care
for our brave military heroes.
Unlike Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer has a real plan, a
plan that helps you get ahead.

MPs Erin O’Toole, Ziad Aboultaif and Leona Alleslev sent a letter to the Clerk

Conservatives intend to call the following witnesses: Minister of Foreign
Affairs Chrystia Freeland, Paul Thoppil, Assistant Deputy Minister for
Asia-Pacific, Global Affairs Canada, Mr. Mulroney and Mr. Saint-Jacques.
 
“These exchanges are highly inappropriate and represent a blatant attempt by
Justin Trudeau to muzzle respected former career diplomats. Justin Trudeau has
shown a clear pattern of silencing those who speak out,” said the Hon. Erin
O’Toole, Conservative Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. “As Mr. Mulroney
stated, discouraging private citizens with expertise in foreign relations from
speaking freely is ‘fundamentally an undemocratic idea’. Justin Trudeau must
answer for the many times he has exploited Canada’s non-partisan, public
service for his own political purpose.”

Regina, Saskatchewan – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, issued the following statement regarding today’s Third Link announcement:
“The announcement of the construction of a Third Link between Quebec City and Lévis is great news for the Greater Quebec City area and the eastern part of the province. I have supported this project since the leadership race in 2017. It has always been a priority for me and for Conservative MPs in Quebec.
“Unfortunately, the nomination of Steven Guilbeault, as the Liberal candidate in the Montreal riding of Laurier—Sainte-Marie, sends a clear signal that Justin Trudeau does not support the project and will try to block it if he is re-elected. Liberal MPs Joël Lightbound and Jean-Yves Duclos have never shown any leadership on this file.
“Steven Guilbeault has always been opposed to the Third Link project. As he said to Radio-Canada on October 13, 2018, “The Third Link will not work. It’s a political pitch to pander to voters in Quebec City’s southern suburbs. This project does not make sense.”
“Only a Conservative government, under my leadership in 2019, will work with the Quebec government and be an ally and proponent of the Third Link. Mobility issues are important in the Greater Quebec City area and we sincerely believe that the Third Link will be an important part of addressing this situation.”-30-

Liberals continue to attack whistleblowers and bully

Ottawa, Ontario – The media are reporting that a whistleblower was let go by a Trudeau cabinet minister after the whistleblower tried to flag concerns about a conflict of interest. According to the media, the Liberal Government appointed Moreen Miller as the new Chair of the of Defence Construction Canada (DCC). The only problem is that Ms. Miller continued her role as President of Fowler, a firm that bids on DCC contracts.  Only now, after once again being exposed, the Government was forced to order an ‘urgent’ investigation into the file. This, on the eve of an election.  This is a pattern. First Vice-Admiral Mark Norman was thrown under the bus for raising concerns about the Trudeau government’s unethical behaviour. Then Jody-Wilson Raybould was fired for raising concerns about the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.  Now a third whistleblower has been let go for flagging a conflict of interest.  It’s obvious that there are one set of rules for Trudeau and his friends, and another set of rules for the rest of us.  Justin Trudeau cannot be trusted and if he is re-elected he will continue to break laws and grant insider access to Liberals and corporate lobbyists.  Under Prime Minister Andrew Scheer the corruption in Ottawa will end. It starts with a judicial inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal and introducing the No More Cover Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access information protected by cabinet confidence.

A new Conservative government will expand RESP so parents can get more for their kid’s education 
A new
Conservative government will boost the Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP),
putting more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadian parents trying to
save for their children’s education, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today.
Under the Conservative plan,
the government’s contribution to an RESP will rise from 20 per cent
to 30 per cent for every dollar invested up to $2,500 a year. This change
will boost the maximum annual grant from $500 to $750. 
“For most parents, sending their kids to college,
university, or trade school is the culmination of years of scrimping and
saving,” Scheer said. “By boosting the RESP, a new Conservative government will
put more money in the pockets of parents working hard to help their children
get ahead.”
Under the Conservative plan:
A couple who begins contributing $25 a month to an RESP right
after their child’s birth will receive $1,620 by age 18. That’s $540 more
than they would receive currently. 
Another couple that is able to invest $50 a month will receive $3,240
in government contributions by age 18. That’s $1,080 more than they
would receive currently. 
Low-income parents will receive 50 per cent
on the first $500 they invest every year. Today, they only receive 40 per
cent. 
“RESPs are the most effective way parents can save
for their children’s education and more and more working families are investing
in RESPs every year,” added Scheer. “A new Conservative government
will help you and your family get ahead. We will make sure that Canadians can
give their kids a smart start.”

Increase the Age Credit to help our seniors get ahead 
Today, Andrew Scheer, the Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, announced
that a new Conservative government will increase the Age Credit by $1,000. This
measure is part of the Conservative plan to put more money in the pockets of
all Canadians to help them get ahead.
“The increase will benefit seniors with low or medium incomes most,” said
Scheer. “Many seniors live on a fixed income and they are at the mercy of
governments like Justin Trudeau’s, which has increased the cost of living and
the price of everyday essentials.” 
Since the Age Credit is income-tested, it will benefit low to middle
income seniors.  With this measure, an
individual aged 65 could receive up to $150 more per year and a couple could
receive up to $300 more per year. 
“Our commitment is clear: it’s time for you to get ahead. This $300 tax
relief for senior couples is on top of our Universal
Tax Cut for all Canadians. We will also eliminate the GST from home heating
costs and introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit. Seniors will benefit
from all those tax cuts and file a single tax return in Québec, as we committed
to do,” concluded Mr. Scheer.
This increase will be the third of its kind made by a Conservative
government. In 2006, and again in 2009, Canada’s Conservatives increased the
Age Tax Credit by $1,000.

Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, today released the following statement:
“Today is the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland, which started the Second World War. On September 1, 1939 Adolf Hitler sent his troops into Poland, a week after signing the Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. During the first few days of the invasion, the German Army was able to destroy the Polish Air Force and capture much of the Polish Army.
“Sixteen days after Germany invaded Poland from the west, the Soviet Army launched its own invasion from the east, which led to the death of nearly a million innocent Poles in just the first few weeks of the occupation. Poland’s initial defeat in its defensive war of 1939 did not break the spirit of the Polish people, who formed the biggest underground movement in Europe in order to defend their country.
“On September 10, 1939, Canada joined the Second World War, serving in six battles and becoming instrumental in ensuring the Allied victory. At that time, for a country with only 11 million people, Canada’s contribution to the War was incredibly significant as more than one million Canadians and Newfoundlanders served in the military. Of these military troops, over 45,000 gave their lives and another 55,000 were wounded. By the end of the War, Canada had become a major military power with one of the largest navies in the world, the fourth largest air force, and an army of six divisions.
“The Second World War remains one of the darkest and most traumatic events in world history. Then as now, Canadians stood for freedom, human rights, and the dignity of all.
“Let us never forget the Canadian and Allied heroes who fought in this war, fighting for democracy and fundamental human rights.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I encourage all Canadians to take the time to educate themselves about the history of World War II and Canada’s valiant role in the Allied victory.

Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, released the following statement on the 77th Anniversary of the Dieppe Raid:
“Today we remember a crucial day in the history of our country and the world. In the dark days of 1942 when Nazi forces occupied most of Europe, 5000 Canadian soldiers went forth to Dieppe, Puys, and Pourville. What would be later known as the Dieppe Raid, laid the groundwork for a successful D-Day invasion in 1944.
“Though the raid would provide crucial information and intelligence to the allied forces, the attack on August 19th was one of the costliest battles that our country  has ever been a part of. Just 2,210 Canadian soldiers returned from France, many of whom were injured.
“Canada’s heroes proved once again their courage and valour on that battlefield, two of whom earned the Victoria Cross for their bravery. They demonstrated to the people living under Nazi occupation that we would never give up the fight for freedom.
“Today, I encourage all Canadians to join me in honouring the souls lost, taken prisoner, and injured during the Dieppe Raid and all who fought for Canada throughout World War II, lest we forget. I also ask Canadians to take a moment to thank the brave and men women of the Canadian Armed Forces who continue to protect our freedom today.”

Tonight, the Liberal Party will nominate a new candidate in the riding of Pierrefonds-Dollards. Justin Trudeau’s preferred candidate in the riding is Sameer Zuberi – a radical activist whose student activism targeted Jewish groups on the Concordia University campus and who has promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11.
When Zuberi was Vice President of the Concordia Students Union, he helped lead a campaign to suspend Hillel, a non-partisan Jewish student organization, from club status.
Jewish students on campus know all too well about the rampant antisemitism they face on campus. Radical student unions consistently try to use technicalities and process to shut-down Jewish-Canadians’ right to freedom of speech and freedom of association on campus as a way to mask their rampant antisemitism.
The fact that this Liberal nomination candidate helped lead the charge should be a red flag for the Liberal Party, however, they have kept him on and green lit him as a candidate.
This is part of a larger trend of festering antisemitism within the ranks of the Liberal Party of Canada. A couple weeks ago, the Liberal Party of Canada was forced to remove a candidate for horribly antisemitic and anti-Israel comments. The Liberal Party knew about these comments for months and were working on a PR campaign to cover them up. It was only once this became a media story that they removed him as a candidate.
Justin Trudeau has still not personally addressed these comments.
Zuberi has also promoted conspiracy theories about the terrorist attacks on 9/11. He commented on Facebook that Bin Laden’s role in 9/11 “is still a matter of public debate.”
9/11 was the most horrific terrorist attack the western world has ever seen.
The facts are not still a matter of public debate.
Osama Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda, and Canada’s and America’s enemies orchestrated a direct attack on our way of life and the freedoms we hold dear.
These conspiracy theories are offensive to the more than 3,000 people who died on that horrible day – including 24 Canadians. Anybody who peddles them is unfit for public office.
Justin Trudeau needs to do the right thing and immediately fire this candidate.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued a statement on Justin Trudeau’s flip flop on his approach to China:
“Justin Trudeau’s sudden change of heart on China is nothing more than a desperate election-year flip flop.
“After years of failed attempts to win favour with Beijing and months of doing nothing while China detains Canadian citizens and blocks important Canadian exports, Trudeau expects Canadians to believe he will suddenly and finally stand up to China with strength and resolve. Meanwhile, he refuses to pull Canadian tax dollars out of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. This is empty rhetoric and a desperate and transparent political manoeuvre that China will see for exactly what it is.
“It is no coincidence that Trudeau’s flip flop comes on the eve of an election and only after Conservatives have clearly and consistently articulated a strong approach to China that puts Canada’s interests first.
“It’s worth noting that Trudeau is, at heart, an admirer of China’s ‘basic dictatorship.’ If he’s re-elected this fall, he will resume his policy of appeasement with China.
“Canadians should know that Trudeau’s sudden shift on China is simply not as advertised.”

Privacy and Ethics have called for an emergency committee meeting so that
parliamentarians can receive a briefing from the Conflict of Interest and
Ethics Commissioner. 
 
Yesterday, the Commissioner released the “Trudeau II Report” which found that
“The Prime Minister, directly and through his senior officials, used
various means to exert influence over Ms. Wilson Raybould. The authority of the
Prime Minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately
attempt to discredit the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as
well as the authority of Ms. Wilson Raybould as the Crown’s chief law officer.”
 
MPs Peter Kent and Jacques Gourde sent a letter to the Chair of the Standing
Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics today requesting an
urgent briefing on this important issue.  In January 2018, former Ethics
Commissioner Mary Dawson appeared at the Committee to provide a similar
briefing on the “Trudeau Report”.  Should the committee agree,
Conservatives intend to move the following motion:
 
That, given the
unprecedented nature of the Trudeau II Report, the Committee invite the
Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to brief the Committee on his
report, and that the Committee invite any further witnesses as required based
on the testimony of the Commissioner.
 
“The Commissioner’s findings are incredibly concerning and show that Justin
Trudeau used the power of his office to reward his friends and punish his
critics.  This is a grave situation.  Not only is Mr. Trudeau the
first Prime Minister to have been found guilty of breaking the law, he is a
repeat offender. Canadians deserve fulsome answers to the many remaining
questions,” said MP Kent.

Taxpayer handouts to wealthy executives, shareholders, and foreign companies to be eliminated, savings to be redirected to Canadians 
Today, Andrew Scheer announced that as Prime
Minister he will appoint Kevin Falcon, the former deputy premier and finance
minister of British Columbia, and Yves Desjardins-Siciliano, the former
president and CEO of VIA Rail Canada, to lead the Commission on
the Reduction of Government Subsidy Programs to Corporations. This is the first
announcement of Andrew Scheer’s 100 Day Action Plan – the steps a new
Conservative government would take to help Canadians get ahead. 
“You shouldn’t have to be a billionaire to get your
government’s attention,” Scheer said. “You deserve a government, and a Prime
Minister, whose first priority will be to help you get ahead.”
The Commission on
the Reduction of Government Subsidy Programs to Corporations will
review all business subsidy programs, including grants and contributions to
corporations. The commission’s mandate will include:
Reducing corporate subsidies by $1.5 billion
per yearRecommending performance metrics for corporate
subsidy programsReviewing innovation programs to ensure that
they are supporting Canadian companies that provide benefits, profits and
patents that stay in Canada.
The commission will be operated out of the Department
of Finance. A new Conservative government will also strengthen Canada’s regional development agencies, focusing on helping
small and medium businesses to grow.
“There is a truism I’ve
learned watching governments of all stripes throw taxpayer dollars at
undeserving corporations. Governments have a terrible record of picking between
winners and losers. I’m proud to have been part of a government that eliminated
all corporate subsidies, grants and equity investments to individual for-profit
businesses. I applaud the Conservative party and Andrew Scheer for their
commitment to scale back this corporate welfare and redirect it where it
belongs, in the pockets of Canadian families,” Falcon said. 
“As in
all areas of government, spending taxpayers’ money must be efficient and
produce the greatest benefits to Canada’s economy. I’m honoured to co-chair
this review with a distinguished Canadian, and I’m confident our review will
yield the expected benefits,” said Desjardins-Siciliano. 
“Hard-working
Canadians are rightly offended when they see their tax dollars going to further
the interests of the wealthy and well-connected friends, while Justin Trudeau
makes them pay more for gasoline, groceries, and home heating,” Scheer said.

OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues the following statement to mark Italian Heritage Month:
“Today I extend warm greetings to Canadians of Italian descent who join Italians around the world to mark Italian Heritage Month, as well as tomorrow’s Italian Republic Day.
“We are fortunate to have so many Canadians of Italian heritage who have chosen, or whose ancestors have chosen, to make our country their home. The Italian community has contributed significantly to our country’s social and economic fabric and we are grateful to have their culture, art, and cuisine as part of our cultural diversity.
“After the Second World War, the Italian state was reconstituted as the Republic of Italy, and Italian people were once again able to live under freedom, democracy, and the rule of law – values that are shared by Canadians and contribute to the close bond between our two countries. Canada can take great pride in the role our armed forces played in liberating Italy in the Second World War and contributing to this process of reconstruction.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my best wishes to all Canadians of Italian background as they gather with their families and friends this month to celebrate Italian heritage!”

“Today, my thoughts are with the families of the victims, the survivors, and the many communities that have felt the pain of these tragedies.

Under my leadership, a Conservative government will develop and implement a National Action Plan, in partnership with Indigenous peoples, to advance reconciliation, address violence and achieve measurable improvements in the day-to-day lives of Indigenous women and girls.
“There are a number of ‘Calls to Justice’ in today’s report that could meaningfully improve the lives of Indigenous women and girls, including the standardization of protocols so all cases are thoroughly investigated and establishing a national task force to review and, if required, to reinvestigate cases across Canada.
“Conservatives will carefully review the details of this final report and continue to hold the Trudeau government to account to ensure that the Inquiry’s report results in closure, peace and solutions for the victims’ families.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issued the following statement on the 30th Anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre:
“Today, Canadians of Chinese heritage join Chinese people around the world to remember the victims who were horrifically attacked at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4th, 1989.
“After weeks of peaceful demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, which means ‘gate of heavenly peace’, military troops marched and opened fire on the crowd of unarmed civilians, killing hundreds, possibly thousands of people. Thousands of survivors were arrested and dozens of others were executed for their participation in the demonstrations, which were thereby suppressed. This violent crackdown on Chinese people peacefully expressing their views by Communist Party rulers is deeply troubling.
“Thirty years later, many Chinese citizens are still persecuted for their efforts to speak out or even commemorate the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen protests, including the relatives of those that were killed.
“I believe that the right to speak freely, as well as the rights to free assembly and association, are inherent human rights and fundamental to any peaceful society. I encourage everyone to remember the victims of the human rights violations that occurred in Tiananmen Square 30 years ago. By publicly acknowledging a difficult past, nations can move towards a more prosperous and harmonious future by firmly resolving to never again let these atrocities happen. I hope that the memory of these events will lead to peace, mutual respect, and recognition of everyone’s right to their freedom and dignity.
“Canada’s Conservatives will always speak out against injustices that take place around the world, standing for freedom, democracy and human rights wherever these fundamental values are under attack.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I join all Canadians of Chinese heritage and Chinese people around the world to remember the victims of Tiananmen Square.”

Yesterday,
Justin Trudeau was in British Columbia to talk about housing, but he failed to
mention the secret Liberal plan to introduce a capital gains tax. 
In 2018, a
senior Trudeau Liberal MP heavily involved in housing policy wrote up a plan
for a 50 per cent tax on hard-working Canadians selling their homes. 
Conservative
Deputy Leader Lisa Raitt said the secret homeowner tax is exactly the kind of
costly new measures a re-elected Liberal government will force upon Canadians.
“This new
homeowner tax would cost Canadians who sell their homes thousands of dollars,”
said Conservative Deputy Leader Lisa Raitt. “In public, Justin Trudeau pretends
to want to help homeowners, but behind closed doors, his team is planning to
hit them hard with a new tax that will cost them thousands. As usual, Trudeau
is not as advertised.”
Behind closed
doors, the Trudeau
Liberals have also proposed soda tax
that would increase the cost of some of the most popular drinks in Canada. 
The Trudeau
Liberals also have a secret plan to hike the carbon tax, which the Minister of
Environment slipped up and made public. So-far, they have refused to answer any
questions about just how high this carbon tax will go, but the independent
Parliamentary Budget Officer found they would have to increase their carbon tax
by five times in order to meet their Paris Targets. 
“Justin Trudeau has spent the last four years making life harder and more expensive for Canadian families. If the Trudeau Liberals are re-elected, they are just going to dip back into the taxpayers’ pocket to pay for their out of control spending,” added Raitt. “Only Andrew Scheer and Canada’s Conservative have a plan to put more money in your pockets to help you get ahead.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues statement on 13th anniversary of the Chinese Head Tax Apology:
“Today, Canadians mark the 13th anniversary of an important apology made by the Conservative Government of Canada to the Canadian Chinese community for the grave injustice of the Chinese Head Tax.
“During the 19th century, the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway sparked an influx of Chinese immigration to Canada during the early years of the Dominion. Chinese immigration was beneficial to the development of our country, yet beginning in 1885, the government imposed a discriminatory and onerous ‘head tax,’ on the Chinese, which they were forced to pay to come to Canada. Following the removal of the tax, the Chinese Immigration Act then banned Chinese immigration to Canada from 1923 to 1947.
“This was truly a dark chapter in Canada’s history. Prime Minister Stephen Harper called it a ‘grave injustice’ and ‘one that we are morally obligated to acknowledge’ during his formal apology in the House of Commons on June 22, 2006.
“Today, over one million Canadians of Chinese heritage call Canada home. They have greatly enriched Canada by their contributions and we are grateful for the tremendous dedication that they have shown in helping build our country.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I encourage all Canadians to take this opportunity to reflect on the important contributions made by Chinese Canadians to our great country.”

Keep Canada united and strong by launching a task force to study the establishment of a national energy corridor, which could bring      Ontario and Quebec hydroelectricity to new markets, open up opportunities for Western Canadian oil and gas, and connect rural communities in Atlantic Canada and the North.Help Canadians get ahead by offering broad-based tax relief, providing a date for balancing the budget, and proceeding with fair tax-free maternity benefits.Restore ethics and accountability to government by introducing stronger penalties in the Conflict of Interest Act.Get the energy sector back to work by tabling a detailed plan, with concrete deadlines, to build the Trans Mountain expansion and repealing Bills C-48 and C-69.Take real action on the environment by drawing on policies from our Real Plan to Protect the Environment, such as the Green Patent Credit, the Canadian Clean brand, the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, and ending raw sewage dumps.Immediately fund regional transit expansion in the GTA, starting with the Ontario Line and Yonge Extension.Reduce the paperwork burden on Quebecers by adopting a single tax return.

Trudeau’s story has changed at least four times since 2001
After media reports revealed that Justin
Trudeau wore blackface during an event at West Point Grey Academy, Canadians
have been asking why exactly Justin Trudeau left his teaching job at the
school. It’s understandable why people have questions, after all Trudeau’s
story has changed four times since 2001. 
First, the Ottawa Citizen reported in 2001
that Trudeau would “give up his teaching job at
a Vancouver private school next September to give speeches.” Several days later
this claim was refuted by Trudeau in a statement issued by lawfirm Heenan
Blaikie. The Montreal Gazette reported Trudeau was accepting a teaching job at
a public school. 
In his 2014 autobiography, Trudeau says he
left the school after a dispute with the administration over an article written
in the school newspaper. According to Trudeau, he convinced a student to write
an article criticizing the fact that the girls at the school were never
reprimanded for the way they dress. This article was deemed disrespectful by
the school’s administration. 
The Vancouver Sun reported in 2015 that the reason Trudeau left the school was “in part over a dispute over dress code and values.”
In a 2019
book by John Ivison, Trudeau’s departure is summed up as “a disagreement over
an article written by a student for which Trudeau was responsible”.
On October 4, 2019 Trudeau said he left the school “because [he] was moving on
with [his] life”.
That same day, the former headmaster of
the school said that Trudeau left the school because he was going to study to
be an engineer. 
Why did Justin Trudeau leave West Point
Grey Academy? What’s the real reason? Why has his story changed so many times,
and if the above reports are incorrect, why hasn’t Trudeau corrected the
record? 
Trudeau will have the opportunity tonight
to tell Canadians the truth.

Justin Trudeau is planning to raise taxes on

He’s raised taxes all while failing to
introduce the senior’s price index which has put even more financial pressure

Unlike Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer has a plan to put nearly $700 back in the pocket of seniors by reducing income taxes on pensions, taking GST off home heating, and cancelling the carbon tax.
Trudeau is making promises to seniors now
because he needs your vote. But just like in 2015 he will break his promises
because he is not as advertised. 
Only an Andrew Scheer government can be trusted
to stand up for seniors and help you get ahead.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew
Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, today
issued the following statement regarding the Final Report of the National
Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls:
“Today, my thoughts are with the families of the victims, the
survivors, and the many communities that have felt the pain of these tragedies.
“Canada’s Conservatives support the process of reconciliation with
Canada’s Indigenous peoples. Under my leadership, a Conservative government
will develop and implement a National Action Plan, in partnership with
Indigenous peoples, to advance reconciliation, address violence and achieve
measurable improvements in the day-to-day lives of Indigenous women and girls.

the standardization of protocols so all cases are thoroughly investigated and
establishing a national task force to review and, if required, to reinvestigate
cases across Canada.
“Conservatives will carefully review the details of this final
report and continue to hold the Trudeau government to account to ensure that

There is one set of rules for Trudeau Liberals and another set of rules for the rest of us
Media are reporting that Trudeau Liberal,
Sven Spengemann didn’t disclose his position as a director of cannabis
start-up, Andean Farm and Pharma Corp. The company is co-founded by Liberal
insider, Dan Veniez.
Corporate cronyism has become all too common under Justin
Trudeau. It’s not surprising that Mr. Spengemann believed he could get away
with this after Justin Trudeau bent to the will of the corporate lobbyists at
SNC-Lavalin.

It’s clear that there are one set of rules for Trudeau and his friends, and
another set of rules for the rest of us.

Justin Trudeau and his Liberal candidates have no respect for rules and it’s
clear that he cannot be trusted. If re-elected, Justin Trudeau will continue to
break laws and grant insider access to Liberals and corporate lobbyists.

Under Prime Minister Andrew Scheer the corruption in Ottawa will end. It starts
with introducing legislation to attach stiff penalties for violating ethics
laws and strengthen the powers of parliamentary watchdogs.

A Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer will uphold the rule of law,
respect our democratic institutions, and help all Canadians get ahead.

Justin Trudeau’s plan to take up to half of the
profits from the sale of your home began back in 2016 when he started
making Canadians report the sale of their homes to the Canada Revenue Agency.
LINK: Sale of your principal residence
Canadians know that whenever the CRA gets
involved it can only mean one thing: More money out of their pockets.
The question is: Why else would the Liberals
need to know how much money you make on the sale of your home if they didn’t
want to take a chunk of it?
In 2018, behind closed doors in a Liberal caucus
meeting, Justin Trudeau’s housing expert Adam Vaughan proposed a secret plan to
implement a tax on up to 50% of the profits on the sale of your home. 
This official
policy proposal from the Liberal caucus
promotes “increasing the capital gains” tax on your home and details a “50% tax
after one year of ownership, 25% after two years, 15% after 3 years, 10% after
4 years, 5% after five.” 
Brace yourselves Canada: Justin Trudeau is
coming for your wallet, only after the election, when he doesn’t need your
vote, but still needs your money. 
FACT:
Trudeau will need more of your money to pay for his never ending deficits
FACT: Trudeau’s
candidates have already admitted the carbon tax will keep going up.
FACT: Trudeau
said he’d lower taxes on the middle class. Instead, he’s raised them on 80% of
middle class families
FACT: Trudeau
said he’d balance the budget in 2019. Instead, he’s running massive deficits
that will mean higher taxes.
You just can’t trust Justin Trudeau. He is not
as advertised.
If Justin Trudeau is re-elected, life will
continue to get harder and more expensive with endless tax hikes to pay for his
deficits and out-of-control spending. 
Only Andrew Scheer and Canada’s Conservatives
have a plan to put more money in your pockets to help you get ahead.

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   St. Catharines, ON – This morning, Andrew Scheer, the Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition, sent the below letter to the RCMP Commissioner regarding the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal:   Commissioner,   I am following up on my correspondence of February 28, wherein I wrote to you to draw your attention to troubling events related to Justin Trudeau’s attempts to interfere in the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin.   You will recall I noted at the time that Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former Attorney General of Canada, confirmed in testimony to Parliament that there were “veiled threats” of consequences from Trudeau and his office if she did not overrule the Director of Public Prosecutions’ (DPP) decision not to award a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) to SNC-Lavalin.   In other words, Ms. Wilson-Raybould would be punished for refusing the bend to Trudeau’s political will and SNC-Lavalin’s financial interests.   Canadians learned last week that the RCMP have begun looking into this situation and interviewing those implicated. This was most certainly a welcome revelation, as many Canadians are keenly interested in how Trudeau will be held accountable.   Criminal investigations are, of course, entirely within your purview. I wish only to note, as I did in February, that it is contrary to section 139 of the Criminal Code for anybody to “obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.”   As you know, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has released an extraordinarily detailed report into this matter.   The Commissioner’s report represents independent and incontrovertible confirmation of Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s Parliamentary testimony, while also introducing several previously unknown facts to the case.   Therefore, it must be regarded as the most important piece of evidence in this matter.   There are several elements of the report that would be relevant to any investigation that you may undertake in this matter.   The Commissioner stated “The Prime Minister, directly and through his senior officials, used various means to exert influence over Ms. Wilson-Raybould. The authority of the Prime Minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms. Wilson-Raybould as the Crown’s chief law officer.”   On a plain reading of the language used by the Commissioner, Trudeau’s actions would fall within the contours of “obstructing, perverting or defeating the course of justice.”  As the report makes clear, he specifically undertook a campaign to do just that in respect of the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin.   This is evident in three main findings of the Commissioner: 
The Commissioner found that in
     addition to the numerous discussions of the financial interests of
     SNC-Lavalin, there were at least four times that political interests were
     discussed with Ms. Wilson-Raybould. Despite SNC-Lavalin filing a
     judicial review of the DPP’s refusal to grant them DPA, and despite Privy
     Council advice to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to avoid contact with
     SNC-Lavalin during the review process, contact between the PMO and
     SNC-Lavalin drastically increased. This included discussion of possible
     resolutions and litigation strategies, despite the clear impropriety of
     engaging in such discussions. The PMO/SNC-Lavalin discussions
     led to both parties approaching a former Chief Justice of the Supreme
     Court of Canada to meet with Ms. Wilson-Raybould and advise her to
     overrule the DPP.  This was done without Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s
     knowledge. 
Together, these findings reveal the degree to which the PMO and
SNC-Lavalin maneuvered in secret to manipulate the administration of justice by
both the DPP and the Attorney General.
 
Essentially, the same PMO
operatives who were pressuring Ms. Wilson-Raybould to overturn the decision of
an independent prosecutor were scheming behind closed doors with the defendant.
Indeed, they were advocating on the defendant’s behalf.
 
Further, they paint a
disturbing picture of a Prime Minister who uses the power of his office to
decide who gets prosecuted and who does not, based solely on his own partisan
political interests.
 
The implications of this –
on everything from the integrity of Canada’s highest political office, to the
independence of our judicial system, to the very rule of law – cannot be
overstated.
 
The powerful and
politically connected absolutely cannot be above the law. The law must be for
all.
 
I believe I speak for
millions of Canadians by requesting that you use all the resources at your
disposal to investigate this matter, not only so that justice is done but so
that it is seen to be done.
 
Thank you for your ongoing
attention to this critically important matter.
 
Sincerely,
 
The Hon. Andrew Scheer,
P.C., M.P.
Leader of the Official
Opposition

A new Conservative government will also boost the Adoption Expense Tax Credit
Andrew Scheer will make it easier for
Canadian families to welcome a new child into their home by introducing EI
adoption leave benefits for adoptive parents and boosting the Adoption Expense
Tax Credit, David Sweet, the Conservative candidate for Flamborough-Glanbrook,
announced today.
“Every year, thousands of Canadians adopt a child. By
opening their homes and their hearts, these families provide stability, love,
and a brighter future for some of the most vulnerable in Canada and around the
world,” Sweet said. “Adoption is one of the most selfless things a Canadian can
do. At the same time, it can also involve significant investments of time and money.
Andrew Scheer will make it easier for Canadians to begin, expand, or complete
their family through adoption.”
A new Conservative government will introduce 15 weeks of
EI adoption leave benefits for Canadians who adopt a child under the age of 18.
A new Conservative government will also amend the Income Tax Act to boost the
Adoption Expense Tax Credit to $20,000, and make the tax credit fully
refundable. As a result, those who pay little to no federal income tax will be
eligible for up to the maximum amount.
Currently, the maximum tax savings a Canadian adoptive
family is eligible to receive in 2020 is $2,482. Under a new Conservative
government, that same family will receive $3,000,
which is an increase of $518. The tax credit
will continue to be indexed as is currently the case.
“Introducing EI adoption leave benefits for adoptive
parents and boosting the Adoption Expense Tax Credit are two of the measures a
new Conservative government will introduce to help Canadian families get
ahead,” Sweet said.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit,      saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit,      allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax      Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and      learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50%, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit,      putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians for green home improvements.

Trudeau continues to assert that media stories are false despite ruling that he broke the law
Last night Justin Trudeau unrepentantly lied
again to Canadians about the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal. In a debate
exchange with Mr. Scheer, Justin Trudeau shockingly asserted that a Globe and Mail
story, which first detailed how Justin Trudeau attempted to interfere in an
ongoing corruptions and fraud court case, was false.

How do Canadians know Justin Trudeau lied last night? Check the record:
Trudeau was investigated by the Ethics Commissioner who determined he broke the law over the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal; Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould confirmed      to a House of Commons committee that Trudeau pressured her to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin court case;Trudeau’s two most senior staff resigned in disgrace and former cabinet minister Jane Philpot resigned      in protest over Trudeau’s unethical behavior; andThe RCMP were blocked from investigating Justin Trudeau’s office.
Despite all this, Justin Trudeau still says the Globe and
Mail story is false.
Why? Because Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. He is a
fraud and he does not deserve to govern this country.
To ensure this never happens again, a Conservative
government will launch a judicial inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin corruption
scandal and introduce the No More Cover Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access
information protected by cabinet confidence.

Regina, Saskatchewan
– The Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, the
Honourable Andrew Scheer, has asked his Members of Parliament on the Public
Safety and National Security Committee to contact the other members of the
committee in order to convene an emergency meeting regarding the personal data
breach at Desjardins.
 
“We must act quickly to help the 2.9 million Desjardins members affected by the
theft of their personal data.  This situation is unacceptable.  The
Public Safety and National Security Committee must meet as soon as possible to
find solutions for Desjardins clients so that they can to protect their
identities,” said the Conservative Leader.
 
Committee members will be able to study a number of ways to prevent the theft
of personal data like at Desjardins. Elected officials will also be able to
study whether or not issuing new social insurance numbers is a viable solution
for Desjardins members.
 
“The members of the committee must work to find possible solutions to
lessen the negative repercussions for Desjardins members. Also, the federal
government must put measures in place to ensure that this situation never
happens again. Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau’s inaction on this issue is not
surprising,” said Scheer.
 
The Member of Parliament for Charlesbourg – Haute-Saint-Charles and Shadow
Minister for Public Security, Border Security and Emergency Preparedness,
Pierre Paul-Hus, will contact the Chair and the other members of the committee
so that an emergency meeting can be held as early as this week.

A new Conservative government will put money back in the pockets of Canadians
Today, the Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, announced
that as Prime Minister, he would introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit to
reduce the cost of public transit and put more money back in the pockets of
Canadians. 
“For so many Canadians, especially our students, young
professionals, young families, and seniors, the cost of public transit can be a
significant out-of-pocket expense. The Green Public Transit Tax Credit will
provide much-needed relief to transit users and commuters so they can just
worry about getting home on time, and not so much about their bottom line.” 
A
family of four in the Greater Toronto Area that regularly takes the TTC would
save almost $1,000 per year with a new Conservative Government’s Green Public Transit
Tax Credit. A young professional regularly commuting on GO Transit from Oshawa
to downtown Toronto would save around $650 per year. 
The
Credit will be for transit passes that allow for unlimited travel within Canada
on local busses, streetcars, subways, commuter trains, and ferries. Some
electronic fare cards and weekly passes can be eligible if they are used on an
ongoing basis.
The Trudeau Liberals eliminated the Public Transit Tax
Credit in 2017 and hit the wallets of 1.8 million Canadians. This is exactly
what Canadians can expect with four more years of Trudeau, poor judgement,
higher taxes, more expenses. 
“Life
is expensive enough and the government should not make it more expensive,” said
Scheer. “My plan is about supporting Canadians and helping them reach their
goals by easing the daily pressures that they face just to get to work, or to
care for their kids, or to manage their homes. This tax credit means you can
worry a bit less.” 
The Green Public Transit
Tax Credit is an important part of A Real Plan to
Protect the Environment, Canada’s
Conservative’s plan to fight climate change by lowering emissions with our core
promise of leaving more money in Canadians’ pockets and letting them get ahead.

The Credit will also
reduce congestion on our roads and cut commute times for Canadians so that
everyone can get home faster at the end of the work day.
FACTS:
The Trudeau Liberals eliminated this tax
credit in Budget 2017. 
Eligible expenses will include monthly transit
passes, as well as weekly passes and electronic fare cards when used for an
extended period. Canadians will be able to claim the credit for transit costs
borne by themselves, their spouses, and children under the age of 19.By making it more affordable for Canadians to
use public transit, we will reduce the number of cars on the road. This will
decrease congestion, allowing Canadians to get home faster at the end of the
workday. It will also help our environment as more Canadians choose public
transit.It is easy to claim the Green Public Transit Tax
Credit as online passes can be claimed.

 Justin Trudeau has been misleading Canadians every step of the way during the SNC-Lavalin scandal.  He said the original Globe and Mail story was “false.” We now know that’s not true.  He said he did not interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. We now know that’s not true.  He said Jody Wilson-Raybould never raised any concerns with him. We now know that’s not true.  Justin Trudeau’s press conference today was no different. Here’s a fact-check of some of Justin Trudeau’s misleading statements.  Justin Trudeau: “It was not a small thing for our government to decide to waive both solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence in the matter…we took that decision because we knew that it was important that Canadians and obviously the ethics commissioner would be able to access all the information and hear all testimony in regards to the matter at hand.”  FACT:  Justin Trudeau has not waived cabinet confidence in its entirety, instead cleverly crafting the wording to ensure certain key details are not made public.  The Ethics Commissioner specifically said in his report that he did not have access to all of the necessary information: “The decision made by the Privy Council Office to deny our Office access to a full range of Cabinet confidences meant nine witnesses were constrained in providing our Office with the full body of evidence potentially relevant to the examination. I believe that decisions relating to my access to such information should be made transparently and democratically by Parliament, not by the very same public office holders who are subject to the regime I administer.”  The Ethics Commissioner added, “During this examination, nine witnesses informed our Office that they had information they believed to be relevant, but that could not be disclosed because, according to them, this information would reveal a confidence of the Queen’s Privy Council and would fall outside the scope of Order in Council 2019-0105.”  The Trudeau Liberals are still preventing Jody Wilson-Raybould from sharing her side of the story after she was fired as Attorney General.  Justin Trudeau: “I can’t apologize for standing up for Canadian jobs.”  FACT:  The motive behind the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal is clearly the Liberal Party’s political self-interests – not Canadian jobs.  The Ethics Commissioner found that on four separate occasions partisan political interests were raised with Jody Wilson-Raybould.  In her testimony to the Justice Committee, Jody Wilson-Raybould said that the Prime Minister told her “I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” Wilson-Raybould also said that a senior Trudeau Liberal staffer told her team that “if six months from the election SNC announces they’re moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said, “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.””  The Ethics Commissioner added in his report that, “While SNC-Lavalin would have benefited from Ms. Wilson‑Raybould’s intervention in the matter, the evidence showed that the governing party also considered the partisan political consequences of not being able to secure a remediation agreement for the company.”  When the Minister of Finance was asked by the Ethics Commissioner about whether any economic analysis was conducted into the consequences of not providing a DPA to SNC-Lavalin he said no: “When asked if he, or his office, had undertaken a study or analysis of the economic impacts of the Director of Public Prosecutions’ decision, Mr. Morneau testified that none had been conducted.”  It’s clear the only jobs Justin Trudeau cared about were his own and those of his Liberal MPs.  Justin Trudeau: “As I said, I take full responsibility. The buck stops with the prime minister.”  FACT:  Trudeau’s legal counsel made the following argument to the Ethics Commissioner: “Third, Mr. Trudeau’s counsel argued that even if his ministerial staff and the Clerk of the Privy Council act on behalf of the Prime Minister when engaging with other ministers or their representatives, Mr. Trudeau cannot be vicariously liable for the actions of his staff since, according to counsel, liability under the Act is personal and based on subjective intent.”  Justin Trudeau: “Where I disagree with the commissioner amongst others is where he says and takes a strong perspective that any contact with the attorney general on this issue was improper.”  FACT:  As the Ethics Commissioner wrote, “Simply seeking to influence the decision of another person is insufficient for there to be a contravention of section 9.”  What the Ethics Commissioner found is that the Prime Minister improperly interfered in a criminal trial in order to suit his partisan self-interests.  This is not the first-time Justin Trudeau has disagreed with the Ethics Commissioner. When he was found guilty of breaking ethics laws for taking a luxury vacation on a private island on the dime of the Aga Khan, the Prime Minister disagreed with the Ethics Commissioner’s definition of his relationship with the Aga Khan.  Justin Trudeau can’t pick and choose the recommendations and conclusions of the Ethics Commissioner, who is an independent officer of Parliament.

Conservatives to review and eliminate taxpayer handouts to wealthy executives, shareholders, and foreign companies 
A new Conservative government will
cancel hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate welfare handouts to wealthy
executives, shareholders, and foreign companies and instead put that money in
Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today.
Scheer said a new Conservative
government will conduct a review of all business subsidy programs in order to
eliminate $1.5 billion in corporate handouts that don’t create jobs and support
economic growth in Canada. 
Those savings would instead go towards
new measures to help hard-working Canadians.
“Under Justin Trudeau, Canada’s
wealthiest and most politically connected have received billions of dollars
from Canadian taxpayers, who are working harder than ever and just not getting
ahead,” Scheer said. “I will put an end to handouts to wealthy executives,
shareholders, and foreign companies and instead put that money in Canadians’
pockets so they can get ahead.”
A new
Conservative government will also review innovation programs to ensure that
they are supporting Canadian companies with patents, technologies, and economic
benefits that remain in Canada. Conservatives believe that government support
should help Canadians by creating jobs and opportunities.

Conservatives
will make sure
that funds spent on research and development will benefit Canadian companies,
so that the intellectual property, technology, and resulting profits will
benefit Canadians.
Conservatives
will also strengthen regional development agencies and mandate them to focus on
economic development, small- and medium-enterprises, and community-based
projects. 
“Hard-working Canadians are rightly offended when they
see their tax dollars going to further the interests of the wealthy and
well-connected friends while Justin Trudeau makes them pay more for gasoline,
groceries, and home heating,” Scheer said. “That’s why I’ll get rid of these
unfair handouts and use those savings to help Canadians get ahead.” 
As
Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Cancel
Trudeau’s Carbon TaxRemove
GST from home heating, saving households $107Make
maternity benefits tax-free, providing up to $4,000 in tax savings Bring
in a Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving families hundreds – potentially
thousands – of dollarsBring

in the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, saving parents up to $150Bring
in the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, saving parents up to $75Boost

People affected by the recent data theft at Desjardins Group are rightly concerned.   “This is why we have asked, at the initiative of Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, that the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security be reconvened for a meeting in order to help Desjardins Group leaders in their efforts to protect and reassure their members, and to find solutions to guarantee the safety of Canadians in the future.   “It is deplorable to see once again the inaction of Justin Trudeau’s Liberals, who have done absolutely nothing to support Desjardins Group. But it is no surprise – we are used to this government’s insensitivity on issues that directly affect Canadians.”   “Only a Conservative government will take a serious look at the challenges of protecting the privacy and personal information of Canadians.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Ottawa, ON
– The Honourable Andrew Scheer, the Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the
Official Opposition, issued the following statement on the passing of Member of
Parliament Mark Warawa:

“I cannot begin to express the sorrow and loss Jill and I feel today
at the passing of MP Mark Warawa.
Mark and I were
first elected to Parliament at the same time, in 2004, and I will always have
fond memories learning the Ottawa ropes together. He was always a source of
wisdom and advice and was always there for our whole team.
Mark was an example
to which all Parliamentarians should aspire. A respectful contributor to the
debate, a fierce advocate for his constituents, and a strong defender of his
principles.
Mark was a true
gentleman. And while his warmth and kindness knew no partisan bounds, his love
for his Conservative family was special. The Conservative caucus is devastated.
He will be missed dearly.
Most of all, Mark
was an exemplary family man – endlessly devoted to his wife Diane, his five
children, and 10 grandchildren. Jill and I are praying that God will comfort
Mark’s family at this time. 
In his last address
to the House of Commons, Mark left us with these words:
“I want to encourage
each of you to love one another, to encourage each other, because God loves us.
Pray for another. Pray about what is really important. Help one another. Seek
God’s will for you each day. Do what is right. Be honest.”
Thank you for
everything, Mark. You will be missed.”

 Two tax credits for kids’ activities mean more money in your pockets 
Today,
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, announced two tangible measures
so Canadians can worry less about their bottom line. 
“This
election will come down to one question: Who do you trust to put more money in
your pocket for you, for your family?” said Scheer. “I have a plan for all
Canadians to get ahead, starting with families who work so hard while raising
their kids.”
With
the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, a new Conservative government will:
Allow parents to claim
up to $1,000 per child for expenses related to fitness or sports-related
activities; Make the credit refundable so
low-income Canadians benefit most; and, Allow parents of children with
disabilities to claim an additional $500 per child, per year. 
With
the Children’s Arts and Learning
Tax Credit, a new Conservative government
will:
Allow parents to claim
up to $500 per child for expenses related to arts and educational activities; Make the credit refundable so
low-income Canadians benefit most;Make it flexible, so children can get
extra help studying a language or learning science, math or coding; and, Allow parents of children with
disabilities to claim double the amount, up to $1,000 per child, per year. 
Under
Justin Trudeau, Canadian families are under pressure and worried about their
future. Half of families are just $200 away from insolvency at the end of each
month. Canadian families’ net worth declined for the first time in a decade.
And because of Justin Trudeau’s carbon tax, every day essentials cost more and
more. 
“Young,
middle-class families are the future of this country. Instead of helping the
middle class like he promised, Justin Trudeau has made life more expensive,”
said Scheer. “I have a plan that will put more money in your pockets – for you,
for your kids. It’s time for you to get ahead.”
As
Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Cut taxes for every working Canadian by implementing the Universal Tax Cut;Support commuters with the Green Public Transit Tax Credit; and,Support young families by making EI maternity and parental benefits tax-free.
FACTS:
The
Trudeau Liberals cancelled two previously available tax credits (arts and
fitness).In
2017, Trudeau falsely claimed “low-income families don’t
benefit from tax breaks.” In fact, claimants of the two cancelled tax
cuts came from all income tax brackets, and from every region of the country.Nearly
1.78 million Canadian families claimed at least one of two previously available
tax credits (arts or fitness) in 2014 alone. That
year, more than 698,000 Ontario families, more than 411,000 Quebec families,
more than 223,000 B.C. families and more than 217,000 families in Alberta
families benefitted from these credits.Some
210,000 families making $40,000 or less (i.e., households in the lowest income
tax bracket) applied for and received these tax credits.

Trudeau refused to rule out legalizing more drugs in TVA debate
Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have left the door wide open to
legalizing hard drugs in Canada if re-elected. Trudeau refused to rule out the
possibility during the TVA debate saying he wouldn’t legalize hard drugs “right
now”.
Here is what Trudeau said: https://youtu.be/KZEgvB0iALc 
Parents who doubt Trudeau’s motivation need look no further than the radical positions on drug legalization of those running to be Liberal Members of Parliament across the country.


Studies have show that drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and
crystal meth are extremely dangerous substances that tear families apart, make
our communities unsafe, and have lasting effects on individuals who choose to
use them. 
In 2018, Liberals voted overwhelmingly to remove criminal
penalties for the possession of hard drugs: https://youtu.be/mad4EED9jyk
Trudeau’s plan to legalize all drugs is extremely
irresponsible, and Canadians deserve to know exactly how this will affect their
families and their communities.
Trudeau cannot be trusted to make responsible decisions for
Canadian families. He is not as advertised.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada issued the following statement for Pentecost:
“Today, Christians across Canada and around the world will celebrate the feast of Pentecost.
“Fifty days after Jesus’ Resurrection and ten days after His Ascension, the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus’ followers, gathered in the upper room with Jesus’ mother Mary.
“The Bible speaks of the Apostles being filled with the Holy Spirit, and they went out and in different languages, began preaching the Gospel to the Israelites gathered in Jerusalem from many different countries. Three thousand people were baptized on that first day, which has long been considered the birth of the Church.
“While the Church was founded by Jesus in Jerusalem, it very quickly spread to other nations and cultures, and today is found in every country around the world, including people of every culture and background. The great diversity of the Church is mirrored by Canada’s diversity, and the teachings of Jesus are held in the highest esteem by so many Canadians of every different background.
“This day is an important occasion to reflect on the history of the Church and on the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Christians seek to be the hands and feet of Jesus in our communities – to reach the broken and hurting, to welcome the oppressed and the down-trodden, and to love the lonely among us – which is made possible by the action of the Holy Spirit in our midst.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my very best wishes to all those celebrating Pentecost.”

“Canadians will have a clear choice to make this October.Between a new Conservative government that will live within its means and put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.
“And a re-elected Liberal government under Justin Trudeau, who has spent the last four years making your life more expensive while enriching his friends and punishing his critics.
“Trudeau can’t run on his record. He can’t possibly defend all of his broken promises, massive deficits, tax increases, and ethics scandals.
“That’s why he’s dredging up divisive social issues trying to distract Canadians from his litany of failures. That’s why he’s running away from the debate stage this fall.
“These debates will shape how Canadians make their decision at the ballot box. Trudeau is trying to shut them down because he’s afraid to defend his record.
“By refusing to attend these debates, Trudeau wants to force their cancellation, and rob Canadians of an opportunity to see him held to account. This is wrong and it shows a lack of leadership.
“So I urge Justin Trudeau to show some courage and to show up. To defend his record and his decisions over the last four years.

Finally, the dream of millions of Ukrainians came true as Ukraine declared its freedom from communism and independence from the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991. Canadians are extremely proud to have been the first country in the West to publicly recognize Ukraine’s sovereignty.“With almost 1.4 million Canadians tracing their heritage to Ukraine, our countries enjoy a special relationship. We are grateful for the contributions of the Ukrainian Canadian community over the last 128 years since the arrival of the first settlers to Canada in 1891.“Canada’s Conservatives have always defended Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Our previous Conservative government was at the forefront of opposing Vladimir Putin and his military aggression and violence in Ukraine following the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. By imposing a wide range of sanctions and providing critical military aid to Ukraine, Canada demonstrated our unequivocal support for Ukraine and its people.“Since the onset of the current conflict, we have been crystal clear that we will never recognize the Kremlin’s occupation of the Crimea and its military invasion of parts of the Donbas region. We will always stand by our friends and continue to condemn human rights violations and illegal persecutions on the occupied territories of Ukraine.“We will always side with those who value freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. We are proud that Operation UNIFIER, started by our previous Conservative government, has contributed significantly to training and building capacity for Ukrainian troops, who are fighting to defend their country.“On behalf of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Official Opposition, we wish everyone celebrating a happy Ukrainian Independence Day!“Slava Ukrayini!”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Vancouver, BC
– The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official
Opposition, today issued the following statement regarding Justin Trudeau’s
‘vision’ for the future of Canada’s natural resources:
 
“For four years Justin Trudeau has attacked Canadian energy workers and passed
laws that will make it harder for them to earn a living.  He told
Canadians in 2017 that he wanted to ‘phase out’ the oil sands and has since
passed several laws that will do exactly that. For once, Justin Trudeau is exactly
as advertised.
 
“Before Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister, Canada had three private
companies willing to invest more than $30 billion to build three
nation-building projects that would have created tens of thousands of jobs and
generated billions in economic activity. Today, none of those projects remain
thanks to Trudeau’s policies. Those companies continue to invest in pipelines
elsewhere in the world. Just not in Canada.
 
“The good news is that in October, Canadians will have a chance to elect a
Conservative government that will champion Canada’s natural resources.  As
Prime Minister, I will cancel the carbon tax, repeal Bill C-69, the
No-More-Pipelines Bill, end the BC shipping ban, establish timelines for
approvals, eliminate foreign interference in approvals process, and invoke
federal jurisdiction when necessary.
 
“I will also champion a national energy corridor for pipelines and transmission
lines that would allow these major, job-creating projects to get built while
also minimizing environmental impact. I am confident that our Conservative plan
will give Canada the best chance of having these kinds of projects succeed.
 
“While Trudeau divides Canadians and attacks our energy workers, Conservatives
have a plan to unite Canadians, get Canada’s resource sector back to work, and
help all Canadians get ahead.”

conservative,https://www.conservative.ca/justin-trudeaus-plastic-flub-2-0/,"
As per usual, the rules just don’t apply to Justin Trudeau. Weeks after making international headlines for announcing a sweeping ban on single-use plastics, the Prime Minister has come under criticism online for posting a photo of a pizza party on Twitter where piled up on the corner of the table are a bunch of single-use plastic forks and knives.

This is no different than how Justin Trudeau will lecture moms and dads driving their kids to and from hockey practice about their carbon footprint and force them to pay a punishing carbon tax one day, and then on the next day Justin Trudeau will jet away to Florida for a sunny weekend get-away.
When the Prime Minister’s Office was questioned about this botched photo-op, they responded by saying the plastic cutlery would be washed and re-used at future events. According to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, re-using plastic cutlery could lead to further degradation, the collection of bacteria in the curls and ridges, and the leaching of chemicals into foods and beverages.
A reporter was also quick to point out while on a Washington trip staff weren’t told to avoid using single-use plastics, rather just keep them out of photos with the Prime Minister. This plastic faux-pas comes after Justin Trudeau spectacularly failed to answer a simple question about the action his family has taken to reduce their usage of single-use plastics. Clearly, Justin Trudeau’s so-called environmentalism is Not as Advertised.

 Scheer details plan to help Canadians get ahead 
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives, emerged as the hands-down winner of the first televised leaders’
debate hosted by Maclean’s and Citytv.
Scheer articulated his positive vision for Canada and his
plan for a new Conservative government to live within its means and put more
money in Canadians pockets so they can get ahead.
Debate takeaways:
It is now clear that Andrew Scheer is the only leader you can trust to put more money in your pocket so you and your family can get ahead.As tonight’s debate confirmed, Jagmeet Singh’s NDP and Elizabeth May’s Green Party believe in the same big-spending, high-taxing policies that Justin Trudeau has delivered over the last four years.With Singh, May, and Trudeau – life will only get more expensive and Canadians will have even less money in their pockets.A hard-working father to five great kids, Andrew Scheer understands the struggles families face across the country. That’s why, as Prime Minister, he will: Scrap Trudeau’s carbon taxRemove GST from home-heating billsMake maternity benefits tax-freePut more money in your pocket – for you, for your kids, for your retirement.Create better, higher paying jobs by embracing nation building projects at home, while standing up for Canadian workers on the world stage. 
Trudeau hides:
An empty podium stood where Justin Trudeau should have
been.
Trudeau wants to run on anything but his record and
against anyone but his actual opponents.
That’s why he’s skipping debates and dredging up divisive
wedge issues.
He cannot defend his record of runaway spending, massive
deficits, and higher taxes.
And he will not tell Canadians by how much his carbon tax
will increase and how much it will cost them.
Trudeau was elected on a promise to help the middle class.
Instead, he raised taxes on 80% of middle-class Canadians and brought in a
carbon tax that makes groceries, gas, and home heating more expensive.
You can’t trust Justin Trudeau. He’s not as advertised.
It’s your time:
Over the next 39 days, Justin Trudeau will do anything he
can to avoid scrutiny, and distract from his record.
He will continue to divide Canadians and spread fear and
misinformation.
Andrew Scheer will remain focused on you.
Making your life more affordable.
Putting more money in your pocket.
For you. For your kids. For your retirement.

Yesterday the Conservative Party received
notice from lawyers representing the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
informing us they would be suing over the use of news clips in a Conservative
Party social media video.
The Conservative Party has grave concern that this decision was made on the eve of an election that CBC is to be covering fairly and objectively. The Conservative Party considers this a complete distraction in the final days of a tightly contested election, and we will dispute this lawsuit fully.
The video in question was removed from our platforms well
before CBC lawyers made the decision to file their lawsuit.
The 17 seconds of CBC clips in the video included Andrew
Coyne highlighting how Justin Trudeau broke the law, Justin Trudeau telling a
Canadian war veteran that he is “asking for more than we can give right now”,
and one CBC reporter questioning why the Liberals provided Loblaws with $12
million in tax dollars to install new refrigerators.
CBC is a taxpayer-funded entity, tasked with covering this
election fairly and objectively. Canadians pay the funding CBC receives.
Canadians pay the salaries for those employed at CBC. Simply, Canadians own
CBC.
When you are funded entirely by taxpayer dollars,
taxpayers should be able to use the footage.
The Copyright Act provides for fair dealing.
Elections Canada provided further clarification on a
September 11th posting to their website, namely:
Question 35. Can a political ad contain a “news clip” without the approval of the broadcaster? Answer:  Prior to the election period, broadcasters can decline to run a political ad on any grounds they choose, provided they treat all parties on an equitable basis.  However, during the election period, they are not entitled to decline an ad unless the broadcast would be in contravention of the law.  If a news clip is relatively short and is not a substantial part of the audiovisual work from which it was taken, the broadcast of the news clip in a political ad would not infringe the copyright of the owner of the audiovisual work and would not require the permission of that owner to be broadcast.
Instead, CBC is using taxpayer dollars to sue a major
political party ten days before a national election in this country.

Luc Berthold, Conservative Shadow Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,
released the following statement regarding the recent Chinese import ban of all
Canadian meat products:
 
“Today, media are reporting that the Chinese government will ban the imports of
all Canadian meat, citing food safety concerns. In the last year, Canada
exported almost $374 million worth of pork, beef, and veal meat to China.
 
“Conservatives know that Canadian farmers produce some of the highest quality
meat in the world. Any assertion by the Chinese government to the contrary is
both false and baseless.
 
“It is clear that this is not an issue of food safety, but a political issue
caused by Justin Trudeau’s incompetence and weakness on the world stage. Canada
has already lost Chinese market access for canola, soy, and now meat. And while
this has been taking place, the Trudeau Liberals have failed to take decisive
action and stand up to the Chinese government. This is just another example of
Trudeau’s failed leadership on the world stage.
 
“With the G20 taking place this Friday, Justin Trudeau must personally raise
this issue with President Xi Jinping and demand that he remove these non-tariff
trade barriers.
 
“Conservatives will continue to stand up and support Canada’s agriculture
sector. That is why an Andrew Scheer government will launch a WTO complaint
defending our producers and pull the funding from the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank.”

“Today, on Canadian Multiculturalism Day, Canadians from all across the country celebrate one of the pillars and long-lasting traditions of this country, our cultural and ethnic diversity.
“We owe our beautiful diversity to the great strength of this country, our freedom. Our long, deep, and proud tradition of freedom goes back well before the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, as perhaps seen most powerfully in Canada having been the destination of the Underground Railroad. Our freedom is the reason why so many people from all around the world come to Canada seeking to be free and to become Canadian.
“I am proud to lead the Conservative Party, a party that believes that Canada’s best characteristics are reinforced by the values of new Canadians. In fact, the very first multiculturalism act was passed under a Conservative Government led by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. New Canadians enrich our communities by bringing with them their values of entrepreneurship; sacrifice; risk-taking; individual freedoms; cultural, familial, and faith traditions; and a desire to succeed. All of these inherently conservative principles are shared amongst those who have come to Canada over the course of our history.
“From as early as 1957, Canada’s Conservatives have been proud to represent the country’s cultural breadth in Parliament. The first Chinese Canadian MP, Douglas Jung, was a Conservative, and so was the first black cabinet Minister, Lincoln Alexander; the first Filipino Canadian Senator, the Honourable Tobias Enverga; the first Korean Senator, the Honourable Yonah Martin; the first Vietnamese Senator, the Honourable Thanh Hai Ngo; the first Pakistani Senator, the Honourable Salma Ataullahjan; the first Hindu MP, Deepak Obhrai; the first Japanese MP Bev Oda; the first Inuk appointed to federal cabinet, the Honourable Leona Aglukkaq; and the first turbaned Sikh appointed to federal cabinet, the Honourable Tim Uppal; among many others.
“As we prepare to celebrate Canada Day and what makes us the best country in the world, let’s reflect on our heritage of freedom that has helped to shape our nation and make it so diverse.

Justin Trudeau has repeatedly said that he will not apologize
for the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal, because he was standing up for jobs.

This is not true. Justin Trudeau promised to be honest with Canadians and to do
politics differently, but clearly he is not as advertised.

The Ethics Commissioner clearly articulated that Justin Trudeau inappropriately
put political pressure on the Attorney General in order to suit the political
self-interests of the Liberal Party.

The Ethics Commissioner found that “on at least four separate occasions”
private political interests were raised with Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Jody Wilson-Raybould testified to the Justice Committee that Justin Trudeau
wanted a DPA because “I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.”

Jody Wilson-Raybould testified to the Justice Committee that a senior Trudeau
Liberal staffer said: “if six months from the election SNC announces they’re
moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said, “We can have the
best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.””

It has also been alleged that a number of senior Trudeau Liberals repeatedly
raised the prospect of the 2018 Quebec provincial election.

The Ethics Commissioner asked Bill Morneau whether he had done any sort of
study or analysis into SNC-Lavalin failing to secure an agreement, and he said
no.

The then CEO of SNC-Lavalin has said he never brought up potential job losses as a
result of failing to secure an agreement with the Prime Minister.

One of Justin Trudeau’s first orders of business after becoming Prime Minister
was to try and cancel a shipbuilding contract with Davie. Davie has said that 400 Quebec jobs were on the line if the
project was delayed.

Immediately withdraw Canada from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.Immediately launch a complaint at the World Trade Organization.Increase inspections on all Chinese imports.Start examining possible retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports that will have the greatest possible impact while minimizing harm to Canadian consumers.
The letter goes on to say:   “I strongly urge you to ignore the advice from senior Liberals, like Jean Chretien and John McCallum, who have suggested we flout the rule of law and give in to the Chinese government’s demands to free Meng Wanzhou. Your actions during the SNC-Lavalin scandal already shook Canadians’ confidence in the justice system to the core.    The only option here is to show strength and finally stand up for Canada.

Trudeau is campaigning with two planes, emitting more than double the amount of other campaigns
Despite marching in climate strikes,
lecturing everybody else on lowering emissions, and imposing a carbon tax on
hard-working Canadians, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are secretly using two
aircraft to campaign in this election.
Conservatives have confirmed that Trudeau’s official
Boeing 737-800 campaign planes (his official branded plane and two
replacements) have been travelling with a second aircraft – a 40-year-old
Boeing 737-200 with tail number C-GNLE.
His official branded plane – tail number C-GTQB – and the second plane were spotted on the tarmac together at Pearson Airport in Toronto yesterday:



Flight records show his three official planes have been accompanied by the second plane throughout the campaign:

Not only is Trudeau running with two
aircraft, his second plane is by far the highest-emitting aircraft in the
campaign. The Boeing 737-200 burns through a staggering 975 gallons of jet fuel
an hour. His official branded plane burns between 800
and 850 gallons an hour.
By comparison, Jagmeet Singh’s NDP plane burns 795 gallons an hour and
Andrew Scheer’s Conservative plane burns 640
gallons an hour.
That means Trudeau’s campaign is emitting nearly three times as

“Canadians are tired of being lectured to and taxed by a

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Ottawa, ON
– Kelly Block, Conservative Shadow Minister for Transport, and Shannon Stubbs,
Conservative Shadow Minister for Natural Resources, released a statement
following the vote on Bill C-48 in the Senate:
 
“Conservatives disagree in the strongest terms with the decision by the Senate
to rescue Justin Trudeau’s plan to land-lock Canadian oil and gas. This
legislation is a slap in the face to out-of-work, under-employed and struggling
energy workers from coast to coast.
 
“This bill is not an environment bill – it is a big part of Justin Trudeau’s
plan to “phase-out” Canada’s oilsands. That is why a future Conservative
government will repeal this bill when we form government.
 
“Despite stark warnings from workers, experts and Premiers about the
devastating impact this bill will have on the entire Canadian economy, the
Liberals and their allies in the Senate are forging ahead with this disastrous
legislation. Conservatives have opposed this divisive and job killing
legislation from day one.
 
“The world needs more Canadian energy. If Canada cannot export oil and gas,
then countries like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Russia with lower human rights
and environmental protections will supply the growing international demand.
Developing Canada’s ethically and environmentally sustainably produced oil and
gas is good for the planet and good for Canadian workers”
 
“While Justin Trudeau is dividing Canadians, killing pipeline projects and
forcing Canadians to pay his job killing carbon tax, Andrew Scheer has a plan
to unite Canadians, get Canada’s energy sector back to work, and help all
Canadians get ahead.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Erin O’Toole, Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, and James Bezan, Shadow Minister for National Defence, issued a statement today calling on Justin Trudeau to commit support for Ukraine as Canada co-hosts the 2019 Ukraine Reform Conference:
“Canada’s role in the world has diminished under the Trudeau Liberals as a result of diplomatic missteps and poor judgment. While the previous Conservative government was a world leader in its support for Ukraine, the Trudeau Liberals are seen to hesitate before standing with their allies.
“As Ukraine’s sovereignty continues to be threatened, Conservatives believe that our duty to support and stand with our Ukrainian friends should not diminish with time. Justin Trudeau must finally step up and take immediate action by doing the following:
Supply the Ukrainian military with lethal defensive equipment;
Restore the practice of providing RADARSAT-2 Imagery to the Ukrainian military;
Expand sanctions to hold additional corrupt foreign officials accountable using the Magnitsky legislation, and ensure current sanctions are enforced;
Advocate for the release of political prisoners, including the Ukrainian sailors illegally captured while transiting the Kerch Strait;
Provide additional humanitarian assistance to support the 800,000 internally displaced people in Ukraine.
“As our country welcomes the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and with Canadians watching, now is the time for Justin Trudeau to act. The defence of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity should be a priority for Canada on the world stage.
“Conservatives will continue to demand that Justin Trudeau commit to supporting our ally in the face of ongoing Russian aggression. And a Conservative government under Andrew Scheer will advocate for, and lead, a peacekeeping mission along the Ukraine-Russia border. We will always side with those who value freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issued the following statement on the Mid-Autumn Festival:
“Tonight, we join Canadians of Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese descent as they prepare to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.
“Communities across Canada will gather under the full moon to light beautiful lanterns, sing songs and share traditional foods, including moon cakes, which are only baked for this special occasion. Based upon the lunar calendar and dating back centuries, the Mid-Autumn Festival is customarily celebrated when the moon is roundest and brightest to express thankfulness for the bountiful harvest.  
“We are blessed to live in Canada, the best country in the world. There are many reasons why Canada is home to large Asian communities who contribute greatly to our country. It is because we are free – free to worship and free to speak and free to believe. It is because of our economic freedom that produces so much prosperity and opportunity. It is because we are equal – equal in opportunity and equal before the law. It is because we are all these things that we are diverse. Diversity is the result of our strength, and our strength is and always has been our freedom.
“My commitment is to help build a Canada where the dreams you have for yourselves and your children and grandchildren are within your reach. So that each generation can not only succeed, but take care of those who have gone before them.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to all those celebrating a Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!”

And Trudeau himself waged a sustained campaign of misinformation, deceit, and manipulation to cover up the truth from Canadians.   “Next week, the House of Commons Ethics Committee will meet to decide whether or not to further investigative these new revelations.  It will be up to the Liberal majority on this committee to decide if an investigation will take place.   “Today I am calling on the six Liberal members of the Ethics Committee to do the right thing and allow this investigation to proceed. So to MPs Frank Baylis, Mona Fortier, Michel Picard, Raj Saini, Anita Vandenbeld, and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, I say this:   “Your leader has betrayed your trust. He has told falsehoods to you and to this country. This Wednesday, you have a choice to make. You can be complicit in this cover-up and stand by a leader who has deceived Canadians. Or you can put Canada first and shine a light on the truth. Your first duty is not to the Liberal Party, it is to Canadians.   “A Prime Minister who so willingly deceives and breaks the law simply can’t be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of that office.   “Starting today, I am launching a grassroots campaign to encourage Canadians to urge these six Liberal Members of Parliament to put their country before their party and to vote to let the Ethics Committee do its work. We will be communicating directly with Canadians to get them to contact these MPs.   “In 2015, Justin Trudeau promised he would be ethical and accountable. And every day since then, he has proven that he is not as advertised. Time and time again, he has abused the power of his office to reward his supporters and punish his critics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Regina, SK – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, released the following statement today outlining his expectations of Justin Trudeau at the G20 Summit in Japan:
“Justin Trudeau’s poor judgment on the world stage and weak approach to China have resulted in serious and in some cases dire consequences for Canadians. He must seize this weekend’s G20 Summit as an opportunity to correct these failures.
“The Chinese government has detained two Canadian citizens for more than six months while dozens of other Canadians have been detained on administrative grounds or had their visas questioned.
“Canada has lost Chinese market access for meat, canola seed, and soy exports, costing our farmers more than $1 billion to date. We can only expect this cost to increase and the situation to worsen over the summer, and into the fall. The issue at hand is not Canada’s high-quality products. Rather, it is Justin Trudeau’s failure to take decisive action and deal with the threats posed by China.
“Each time China has taken these actions, Trudeau has failed to stand up for Canada. Like Donald Trump during NAFTA negotiations, China has learned it can walk all over Canada, without consequence, with Trudeau in charge. That has to end now.
“Trudeau must personally raise these issues with President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit. He must secure the release of Canadian detainees, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. And he must restore market access for Canadian farmers. Anything less would be yet another failure.
“Canadians expect their Prime Minister to defend Canada’s interests whenever they come under attack. It’s time for Trudeau to finally rise to the occasion and get results.
“As Prime Minister, I will stand up for Canada by pulling funding from the Asian Infrastructure Bank. Trudeau should never have sent Canadian tax dollars there in the first place. His decision to continue financing it is an example of his weakness and poor judgment on the world stage.”-30-

“Mabuhay!
“Today, we join the Filipino-Canadian community and Filipinos around the world to celebrate the historic 121st anniversary of the Declaration of Philippine Independence.
“Today marks the maturing of a free nation, built and preserved by courageous men and women who have devoted their lives to promoting a democratic and free country.
“It was under the previous Conservative government that Canada received more immigrants from the Philippines than from anywhere else in the world. As one of the fastest growing communities, over 700,000 determined and passionate Filipino-Canadians proudly call Canada their home. Canadians of Filipino heritage are resilient, hard-working citizens who are students, artists, business owners, and leaders within our communities.
“It was also in 2012, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed the late Senator Tobias Enverga Jr to become Canada’s first senator of Filipino descent. Senator Enverga was a role model and leader within the Filipino community, serving in the Upper Chamber with dedication, integrity and determination. He was known for fiercely advocating for persons with disabilities and was a tireless champion of the inherent dignity and sanctity of human life.
“Our shared values are the cornerstone of the relationship between Canada and the Philippines, and our mutual commitment to international and economic development has strengthened that bond. Canada is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law, and fundamental and universal human rights. We absolutely must protect these values – because they are what set us apart. They allow Canada to offer what so many other countries simply cannot: The freedom to preserve and pass on our cultural traditions and the opportunity to live in peace with those around us.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I wish all those celebrating, a Happy Philippines Independence Day!

Liberals misrepresenting Conservative plan to support infrastructure
Justin Trudeau is lying and misrepresenting the Conservative plan to support infrastructure projects across Canada. Let’s look at the facts. Public policy expert Jack Mintz confirmed that the Conservative plan only “delays” infrastructure spending by three years. He also confirmed that these delays only impact “uncommitted infrastructure spending”.  In contrast, the Liberals cut up to 40% of infrastructure spending from 2016-2017.  The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) agrees. The PBO confirms that the Conservative plan will extend “spending for the Investing in Canada Plan (ICP) over an eleven-year period, rather than the eight-year period.” The PBO also says that the Conservative plan would “spread the same nominal amount of money over a longer period of time”. The PBO also confirmed that our plan continues “funding obligations already committed to by the Government”.  Justin Trudeau is lying to Canadians. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives will maintain infrastructure spending. Instead we will cut corporate welfare and foreign aid to relatively wealthy countries in order to lower taxes and help you get ahead. https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/ElectionProposalCosting/Results/33020559_EN.pdf?timestamp=1570992945242 https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/Reports/2019/Main_estimates_2019_20/The%20Government%E2%80%99s%20Expenditure%20Plan%20and%20Main%20Estimates%20for%202019-20_EN.pdf.pdf

Conservative foreign policy will cut aid spending by 25% and put it back in the pockets of Canadian families
Today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer detailed
his plan for delivering strong Conservative leadership on the world stage.
On the same day the Munk debate on foreign policy
was supposed to take place before Justin Trudeau forced its cancellation, Scheer
shared details around four key pillars of his foreign policy plan which
include:
Cutting 25% of foreign
aid spending – The reduction will come from middle- and upper-income countries
as well as hostile regimes. We will use the savings to pay for policies that
help Canadians get ahead at home and also redirect
$700 million to strengthen foreign aid in the countries that need it most. We
will continue to work in partnership with leading Canadian aid organizations
including volunteer-focused groups who provide much-needed assistance to
developing countries.
Strengthening
Canada’s commitment to traditional alliances and providing additional military
and non-military support to Ukraine.
Advocating for human
rights on the world stage by using Canada’s Magnitsky legislation to target
hostile regimes like Iran.
Depoliticizing
military procurement in order to properly and expediently supply the Canadian
Armed Forces.
“Justin Trudeau has spent the last four years
humiliating himself and all Canadians on the world stage with his weak,
unprincipled leadership,” Scheer said. “Canadians deserve a Prime Minister that
will once again make them proud and who will always stand up for Canada’s
interests in an increasingly hostile world.”
Scheer highlighted the long and growing list of
scandals and humiliations that have harmed Canada’s reputation during Justin
Trudeau’s time in power, including his admiration for China’s “basic
dictatorship,” his praise for Cuban communist dictator Fidel Castro, his disastrous
India trip, and his disgraceful Omar Khadr settlement.
On foreign aid, Scheer said his plan will refocus Canadian
help where it is most needed while helping more Canadians get ahead at home.
“At a time when Canadians are working harder than
ever and not getting ahead, Trudeau is using their hard-earned tax dollars to
support antisemitic organizations and prop up foreign dictatorships,” Scheer
concluded. “Our plan will take Canadian tax dollars away from corrupt dictators
and wealthy countries and return it to Canadians so they can get ahead.
“At the same time, we will continue to consider aid proposals
which support non-development objectives such as minority rights and peaceful
coexistence taking place in any country,” Scheer said.

New transnational project to generate economic and social benefits across the country
A new Conservative government will create a national corridor to carry Canadian energy and resources from coast to coast, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“It’s time for a government that understands we’re in this together,
that Canada works better when we work together,” Scheer said. “A new National
Energy Corridor will create jobs and opportunities while uniting Canadians in
our shared potential and prosperity.” 
A National Energy Corridor will generate
economic and social benefits for the entire country by moving oil, gas,
hydroelectricity, telecommunications, and potentially accommodating other
linear infrastructure. With a single corridor, industry wouldn’t need to submit
complicated proposals for every new project.
A single coast-to-coast corridor would:
minimize environmental impactslower the costs of environmental assessments without sacrificing qualityincrease certainty for investorsget critical projects builtand create good-paying jobs. 
A new Conservative government will appoint a
blue-ribbon task force to provide recommendations within six months of its
establishment on how to proceed. The government would then begin to work with the
provinces and Indigenous peoples – who would both share in the prosperity this
project would provide – to realize this vital coast-to-coast link. 
“As
Canadians, we need to start dreaming big again, and we need to start dreaming
together,” said Scheer. “We need to start building a stronger, more united
country worthy of those who came before us and that our children and
grandchildren deserve.” 
Today’s announcement is part of Andrew
Scheer’s plan to create jobs for Canadians across the country and help you get
ahead.  
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving a couple earning average salaries $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit,      allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and      learning programs. Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest      income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax      Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians for green home improvements.

Ottawa, ON
– Luc Berthold, Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Agri-food, and Dean
Allison, Shadow Minister for International Trade Diversification, today
sent a letter to the Agriculture Minister and the Trade Minister calling on the
Liberals to update Canadians on the actions they have taken to resolve the
Chinese government’s ban on Canadian meat.

“The original ban by the Chinese government of these Canadian products was
reportedly due to counterfeit Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) export
certificates,” said MP Berthold. “It is our expectation that the CFIA has put
in place adequate safeguards to assure the Chinese government that this will
not occur again.”

Some commodities, like Canadian soy, have not shipped a single vessel since
December. Canadians need to be updated on the status of this ban and know if
Canada’s meat products will face a ban similar to canola and soy.

“Canada’s agriculture industry depends on stable trade relationships. This
stability allows our farmers and producers to plan appropriately and ensure
success. Unfortunately, under this government this has not been the case,” said
MP Allison. “The trade barriers currently in place for our agriculture sector
will have long-term negative effects not only on our farmers and producers, but
the Canadian economy as a whole.”

The Trudeau Liberals must answer these simple questions: 
Has
     the CFIA addressed the problem of counterfeit export certificates to the
     satisfaction of the Chinese government? If not, when will this happen?How
     much money is this trade barrier with the Chinese government costing
     Canada’s pork and beef sectors?

Trudeau calls on Québecers to fight Ontario and Alberta
Today during a press conference, Justin Trudeau called on Québecers to fight Albertans and Ontarians. Here is what Trudeau said: “[Q]uébecers need to stand up and fight against those like Jason Kenney and Doug Ford and other conservative politicians.” But here is what Trudeau said just yesterday: “Everything I tried to do in the last four years has been focused on bringing the country together. Yet we find ourselves now in a more polarized, more divisive election than even the 2015 one.” Justin Trudeau disparages the 19 million Canadians these leaders represent. He is a hypocrite and cannot be trusted to unite Canadians. Trudeau is simply not as advertised. Regardless of our differences, or our political views, politicians should never pit Canadians against one another. Trudeau’s comment today is unbecoming of an individual who aspires to be Prime Minister, and whose job it is to unite Canadians. This is just another example of how Justin Trudeau will do and say anything to get re-elected, even turn Canadians against each other for his own political gain. Andrew Scheer is a consensus builder, he has run a positive campaign focused on what leaders across provinces and cities can accomplish together, regardless of party affiliation. The Conservative Party is the party of nation building and on October 22nd, we will start to repair the damage Justin Trudeau has done to our federation.

When Justin Trudeau was asked about small actions his family has taken to reduce plastic waste in their household, this is what he had to say:
“Uh, we, uh, we have recently switched to drinking, uh, water bottles out of, uh, water out of, uh, when we have water bottles, uh, out of plastic, uh, sorry, away from plastic towards, uh, paper, um, like drink box water bottles sort of things.”
Syntax aside, here are the facts about Trudeau’s “drink box water bottle sort of things”:
“Drink box water bottle sort of things” are way more expensive than normal bottled water: A 24 pack of Boxed Water is Better sells online for $44.96 USD. By comparison, a 24 pack of Nestle is currently on-sale for $2.50 CAD at Loblaws.
But, nothing is cheaper than good old-fashioned tap water! At the price of a 24 pack of Boxed Water is Better, the Trudeau family could easily afford a top of the line Brita filter.
“Drink box water bottle sort of things” are actually less environmentally friendly than plastic water bottles: According to the Alberta Bottle Depot Association, boxed water containers are less recyclable than plastic water bottles, and that consumers are more likely to recycle plastic water bottles than boxed water containers.
Trudeau hasn’t entirely switched to “drink box water bottle sort of things”: Just like how the Trudeau Liberals jet-set around the world to photo opportunities at international conferences, while at the same time lecturing families using a car to commute to and from work, it appears Justin Trudeau’s environmentalism is Not as Advertised.

conservative,https://www.conservative.ca/unanswered-questions-in-the-snc-lavalin-corruption-scandal/,"
 
Justin Trudeau’s SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal was a sad chapter in our
country’s history. The Prime Minister of Canada was found to have broken ethics
laws in order to try and get his corporate friends out of criminal corruption
charges.
 
The Ethics Commissioner provided many new details for Canadians concerned about
this corruption scandal, but there are now even more outstanding questions and
Canadians deserve answers.
 
Justin Trudeau promised to do politics differently. He promised to be open,
transparent, and honest, but throughout this corruption scandal he has proven
time and time again to be not as advertised. He has stonewalled the Ethics
Commissioner, shut-down committee investigations, and silenced Jody
Wilson-Raybould.
 
This week, Canada’s Conservatives have recalled the Ethics
Committee in the search of answers. Let’s hope the Liberal members on the
committee do the right-thing, put the interests of our country ahead of the
Liberal Party, and allow the committee to look into the matter.
 
Here are a few of the outstanding questions in Justin Trudeau’s SNC-Lavalin
corruption scandal:

1) On April 3, 2019, Justin Trudeau said “we put forward an unprecedented
waiver that suspended solicitor client privilege in this matter, that suspended
cabinet confidentiality so (Jody Wilson-Raybould) could speak fully to this
matter.” Yet the Ethics Commissioner found that 9 people were being gagged by
Justin Trudeau and were unable to talk. Why is he continuing the cover-up?
 
2) In a letter dated June 13, 2019, Justin Trudeau’s deputy minister sent a
letter to the Ethics Commissioner declining to provide additional
information.  Did Justin Trudeau or his close advisors instruct another
public servant to do his political dirty work? 
3) The Table
of Public Statutes identifies the Minister of Justice as the responsible
Minister for the sections of the Criminal
Code related to remediation agreements. The Ethics
Commissioner revealed that Jody Wilson-Raybould did not sign the Memorandum to
Cabinet authorizing this legislative change.  Who did? 
4) Why did
Justin Trudeau say after his September 17th meeting with Jody
Wilson-Raybould that she was open to revisiting her position on interfering in
an ongoing criminal trial? 
5) Why did
Scott Brison attempt to exert influence over Jody Wilson-Raybould to interfere
in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin? 
6) Why did
Scott Brison send SNC-Lavalin’s legal strategy to senior advisors to Justin
Trudeau two weeks after SNC-Lavalin launched a judicial review of the Director
of Public Prosecutions’ decision to not negotiate a deferred prosecution
agreement? 
7) Why did
senior advisors to Justin Trudeau brief SNC-Lavalin that Gerald Butts would
advocate for their issues with Jody Wilson-Raybould as the two of them met at
the Chateau Laurier? 
8) Why did
Gerald Butts tell Jody Wilson-Raybould’s Chief of Staff that “the government
had set up the remediation agreement regime to allow SNC-Lavalin to benefit
from the tool”. 
9) Does
Justin Trudeau agree with his legal counsel that he is not “vicariously liable”
for the actions of his staff?  How does this equate to “taking full
responsibility”? 
10) In the Trudeau II Report, the
Ethics Commissioner writes “Mr. Trudeau’s legal counsel also wrote that Ms.
Wilson-Raybould’s anger at being moved from the office of the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General coloured her perception of prior events…Ms.
Wilson-Raybould failed in her duty, as Attorney General, to acquaint herself
with all the relevant facts.  Rather than making a meaningful, independent
decision of her own, Ms. Wilson-Raybould reflexively deferred to the Director
of Public Prosecutions’ decision.”  Does Justin Trudeau agree with his
legal counsel’s apparent assessment that Jody Wilson-Raybould was emotional and
couldn’t be reasoned with?

SEPTEMBER 29, 2019
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“This evening, at sundown,
the Jewish communities in Canada and around the world prepare to mark Rosh Hashanah
– the New Year- and the beginning of the High Holy Days.
“Rosh Hashanah is celebrated
on the first two days of the month of Tishrei, and marks the beginning of the
ten days of repentance during which Jews around the world will reflect on their
actions over the past year and seek forgiveness.
“As friends and families
share meals with sweet challah and apple slices dipped in honey, they will
reflect on renewal, and hope for an abundant year ahead.
“Canada has been blessed by
the strong presence of the Canadian Jewish community who enrich our country’s
culture and values of pluralism and freedom. As the Jewish community remains a
targeted group for hate-related offences, this Rosh Hashanah, let us recommit
ourselves to combating all forms of antisemitism and work together to educate
and to better our country.
“On behalf of the Canada’s
Conservatives, I extend my best wishes to the Jewish community, across Canada
and around the world, celebrating Rosh Hashanah and hope for a peaceful and
prosperous year ahead.
“L’Shanah Tovah Tikatevu
V’Tichatemu.”

With Gerald Butts back in Justin Trudeau’s inner circle, the Prime Minister can no longer run and hide from lingering questions regarding the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.   Gerald Butts was the enforcer behind the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal. Butts misled Canadians during his testimony to the Justice Committee, bullied former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, and oversaw the Trudeau government’s scheme to interfere in the criminal trial of the Liberal-connected corporation.  Meanwhile, Jody Wilson-Raybould was booted from the Liberal Party for speaking truth to power.   Justin Trudeau puts blind loyalty over ethical behavior. Questions about his corruption scandal remain:    1. Why did Gerald Butts resign from the Prime Minister’s Office? Did he receive any severance? If so, how much? Was he in contact with the PM, PMO or government officials while he was “outside”?  2. What did Jane Philpott mean when she said “I’m not sure that the whole story will ever come out. It is really complex — links between various officials both elected and unelected. Links here are pretty deep. There are things that I heard that won’t come out because of cabinet confidentiality”?  3. Why did the PM refuse to allow any figure bound by cabinet confidence (JWR, Philpott, Butts, Wernick) to speak about any events that occurred after January 14th, 2019?   4. Have assurances been made to SNC-Lavalin that they will receive a deferred prosecution agreement before the election?   In her submission to the Justice Committee, Jody Wilson-Raybould wrote “I did make another decision at this time – that I would immediately resign if the new Attorney General decided to issue a directive in the SNC-Lavalin matter.”  Was this why JWR resigned as Veterans Affairs Minister?   5. When the PM fired Jody Wilson-Raybould for the first time on January 7th, 2019, Butts’ notes recorded the PM telling her “after an election, everything is fresh again.”  What did that mean?   6. On February 11th, just before the resignation, Butts was with Trudeau in Vancouver. What happened in that meeting?   7. On four occasions, Michael Wernick said that the PM was “in a firm mood” or “in a mood” about the deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin.  What did that mean?   8. Why did Gerald Butts tell the Justice Committee that “there was no urgency” to his request for JWR’s Chief of Staff to meet with him, when his assistant had sent an email summoning the former Chief of Staff to a meeting at 4:14 PM on December 18th labelled urgent?   9. What firms have been retained, at taxpayer expense, to represent the PM, PMO or others in the SNC-Lavalin Affair and what has the cost been to taxpayers?
