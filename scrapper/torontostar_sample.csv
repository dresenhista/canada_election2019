"The latest novel coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Saturday (this story is no longer updating. Read Sunday’s coverage here). Web links to longer stories if available.:8:55 p.m.: Canadian Broadway star Nick Cordero will have his right leg amputated as he continues to battle COVID19, his wife, celebrity trainer Amanda Kloots, said on Instagram on Saturday.The New York Daily News reported that Cordero, who has been sedated for 18 days, has been experiencing issues with clotting and getting blood to the toes of his right foot. Blood thinners caused pressure issues and internal bleeding in his intestines.“We took him off the blood thinners, but that again was going to cause the clotting in the right leg,” Kloots wrote. “So the right leg will be amputated (Saturday).”Cordero, a 41-year-old Hamilton native, was nominated for a Tony for his role in “Bullets Over Broadway” in 2014.8:30 p.m.: The union representing TTC workers is demanding management shut down the Queensway garage and declare a COVID-19 outbreak at the site after learning of another confirmed case at the shop.According to the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113, there have already been four confirmed cases at the site, with another four members feeling ill and reporting symptoms.More than a dozen mechanics at the site staged a work stoppage Saturday, refusing to go out on their 3 p.m.-11 p.m. shift after a contract cleaner who worked there tested positive for the coronavirus.“Our members are scared and they don’t feel safe. They want the facility be shut down for two weeks and cleaned up,” said Carlos Santos, the president of the local union.Saturday’s work refusal followed a similar action days ago at TTC’s Wilson and Queensway divisions, when at least 38 bus drivers refused to go out on their shifts. That ended with a ruling by a Ministry of Labour representative against the workers.7:05 p.m.: New Yorkers will be able to get marriage licenses online and wed via video during the crisis.Many marriage bureaus have been closed because of the health emergency, leaving couples unable to get licences because the state requires the betrothed to complete their application in person.But Gov. Andrew Cuomo is going to order that provision waived to let couples apply remotely, his office said Saturday. The state will also enable town and city clerks to conduct weddings by video.“There is now no excuse when the question comes up for marriage. No excuse. You can do it by Zoom. Yes or no,” the governor said with a chuckle.Earlier this week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was asked at a news briefing about the possibility of online marriage applications, particularly for any couples seeking to wed so they could share health insurance after a job loss. Officials have said an estimated half-million city residents are out of work or likely to lose their jobs soon.De Blasio said the online application idea was worth exploring, but he stressed that there are other ways for residents to get health insurance, including through the city's NYC Care program.“We don’t want people to feel like, ‘Oh, my God, unless I’m married, I can’t get on someone’s plan, I have no options,’” he said.5:30 p.m.: Ontario has seen another 38 deaths from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, according to the Star’s latest count.As of 5 p.m. Saturday, Ontario’s regional health units were reporting a total of 573 deaths from COVID-19 and 11,305 confirmed or probable cases of the disease since the beginning of the pandemic.The largest increase in deaths Saturday came in Durham Region, which reported another seven fatal cases to a total of 47. Thirty-six of those have come in a long-term-care home or retirement home, the health unit reports.The jump of 552 cases from the same time Friday works out to a daily growth rate of 5.1 per cent — slower than in recent weeks.The Star’s count is based on the public tallies and statements of Ontario’s 34 regional health units, the local bodies that collect and publish this data often before reporting to the province through its central reporting system. As such, the Star’s count is more current than the data the province publishes each morning. Earlier Friday, the province reported that testing labs had processed nearly 9,500 samples in the largest single-day total since Ontario quietly changed how it reports the data.The province says 828 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 250 in an intensive care unit, of whom 197 are on a ventilator — totals that remain significantly less severe than Ontario’s worst-case projections. A total of 4,875 people have recovered after testing positive for the virus, according to the provincial data.The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of deaths — 478 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.5:20 p.m.: More grim numbers have emerged at a long-term care facility in suburban Montreal as the Canadian Armed Forces prepared to fan out to nursing homes across a city that has become Canada’s COVID-19 epicentre.Sixty-one of 99 residents at the Residence Herron have tested positive for COVID-19, with some results still pending, according to the regional health authority.Some of the residents have been hospitalized “because of their condition,” said Guillaume Berube, a spokesman for the CIUSSS l’Ouest-de-l’Ile-de-Montreal.The new numbers do not include the 31 deaths reported earlier at the facility, which came under provincial trusteeship after reports of appalling conditions at the home.“Because of the 31 deaths, there’s an investigation, and I can confirm that five of them died because of the virus,” Berube said in a phone interview Saturday.4:20 p.m.: As the divide deepened between Americans who want to reopen the country and those who urge continuing social distancing to slow the spread of coronavirus, one microcosm of the debate centred Saturday on some newly reopened Florida beaches.The #FloridaMorons hashtag started trending on Twitter as social media users shared images of crowded shorelines in the Jacksonville area.Some Twitter users called Florida the laughingstock of the nation, declared Saturday to be “Darwin Day,” and warned that the action would extend quarantine durations. They posted memes criticizing the government officials who made the decision as well as the residents and visitors who went to the beach.Others spoke out in support of the beach reopenings, some of them saying Floridians need fresh air and exercise, and others stating that grocery store shoppers are closer to each other than the beachgoers have been so far.1:30 p.m.: In an announcement made today by Premier Doug Ford and Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities, Ontario will be investing $20 million to advance medical research to find a vaccine to combat COVID-19 through the Ontario COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund.Ontario researchers, research institutions, and research corporations are encouraged to submit proposals before April 24, 2020 through the Ontario Together website.Researching eligible for funding includes, but is not limited to, researching the COVID-19 strain, developing a vaccine, enhancing testing procedures, or improving modelling tools to help track the virus, according to the province’s media release.“We have some of the best and brightest minds anywhere in the world right here in Ontario,” said Premier Ford. “Whether it’s developing a vaccine, using 3D printers to make personal protective equipment or designing better portable ventilators, our brilliant researchers are leading the charge in the fight against COVID-19 and giving our front-line health-care workers the tools and resources they need to deliver top-notch care for patients.”The provincial government says they are working with colleges to get trained paramedic students into the workforce to support front-line health care workers. “Colleges will provide training opportunities and a streamlined path to early graduation and practice for paramedic students with valuable skills needed by the health care sector,” according to the media release.1 p.m.: Premier Doug Ford gives his daily address to Ontarians and reporters from Queen’s Park at 1 p.m.11:25 a.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the U.S. and Canada have agreed to keep the border closed to non-essential travel for another 30 days.Trudeau says it will keep people on both sides of the border safe amid the pandemic. U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday the U.S.-Canada border will be among the first borders to open. Nearly 200,000 people normally cross the border daily.In his opening remarks the prime minister announced two planes filled with N95 masks and coveralls arrived in Canada on Friday. Trudeau thanked Toronto Stamp Inc., a manufacturer of signs, rubber stamps and badges, for supplying millions of face shields over the next two months.Trudeau also announced the allocation of $306 million to support Indigenous businesses. The sum includes interest free loans and non-refundable amounts of money that are set to be administered by the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association. 11:20 a.m.: Ontario’s regional health units are reporting another 39 COVID-19 deaths and 622 new cases in the last 24 hours, according to the Star’s latest count.As of 11 a.m. Saturday, the Star had counted a total of 10,934 confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases, including 557 fatal. The case total is up 6.0 per cent from the same time Friday morning, around the same rate of daily growth the province has seen over the last seven days. If sustained, that growth rate would double the province’s case total about every 12 days. 　Still, Ontario’s COVID-19 epidemic has slowed from earlier: Last week, cases averaged 8.6 per cent daily growth and the week before that averaged 15.6 per cent growth.Ontario’s case total have more than quadrupled since March 31; deaths have risen even faster, up nearly 800 per cent from 61 at the end of last month.The Star’s count is based on the public tallies and statements of Ontario’s 34 regional health units, the local bodies that collect and publish this data often before reporting to the province through its central reporting system. As such, the Star’s count is more current than the data the province publishes each morning.　Earlier Friday, the province reported that testing labs had processed nearly 9,500 samples in the largest single-day total since Ontario quietly changed how it reports the data.The province says 828 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 250 in an intensive care unit, of whom 197 are on a ventilator — totals that remain significantly less severe than Ontario’s worst-case projections. A total of 4,875 people have recovered after testing positive for the virus, according to the provincial data. The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of deaths — 478 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”The Star’s count, includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.11:10 a.m.: Toronto Mayor John Tory told the Star Friday he felt it was time to convene the senior leaders of the city’s emergency response to the COVID-19 to start work on how to reopen the city when public health officials say it is safe.The mayor said he didn’t expect detailed plans to be drafted. He hoped for a framework for how to allow, in stages, Toronto businesses and residents to start to get back to normal.They’ll start to work on questions such as, when restaurants can reopen dining rooms — should the city start by allowing them to fill only part of their capacity.Public health officials will be at the meeting to ensure the plans, as they unfold, follow the best advice on how to avoid further infections or a “second wave” of the virus.“Saturday is to deal with ‘How do you develop the staged plan?’ And how do you marry it with the requirements of public health?’”10:17 a.m.: The Regional Municipality of York announced access to the York Regional Forest will reopen to the public Saturday, with COVID-19 guidelines for all users.“With milder weather coming, York Region recognizes the need for people to get outside and connect with nature and the much-needed health benefits our public tracts provides,” York Region said in a statement.The region is enforcing stricter guidelines for the public accessing the York Regional Forest and its 21 public forest tracts. Including physical distancing of at least two meters between forest users, leashes on dogs in all areas, and no littering. 10 a.m.: Members of a Manitoba First Nation will each be handed a mask, gloves and sanitizer as they head to the ballot box on Saturday.“We’ve never gone through this before,” said Shawn Kent, a councillor for Brokenhead Ojibway Nation. “It’s unprecedented and it’s a different way of doing things that we are going to find out if it’s viable or not.”First Nations across the country are deciding whether to hold elections during the COVID-19 pandemic. Brokenhead, about 65 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, chose earlier this week to go ahead with its election for chief and four council members.It was a difficult decision, said Chief Deborah Smith. Officials were receiving constant and changing information about the novel coronavirus and steps had already been made to hold the election.Mail-in ballots were sent out weeks ago to about 1,200 community members who live off reserve. For the 700 members who live on the reserve, however, Smith said there was a lot of anxiety.“There were people that felt that because of the health factors that we should delay. But there was also a voice from the community that wanted to proceed ... so that they could exercise their democratic rights.”Marc Miller, minister for Indigenous Services Canada, urged First Nations across the country to delay elections for six months.But First Nations in many regions voiced concern that if they chose to delay it would have a serious consequence — a gap in leadership during a health crisis.The Indian Act says that a chief and council cannot extend their terms. First Nations communities were concerned that without an election, an interim government or third party would be put in place to lead the community.Word spread throughout Indigenous communities that this meant they would be forced to hold elections, said Arlen Dumas, grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs.The group representing 62 First Nations in Manitoba reached out to the minister last month about the concerns. Dumas said eight First Nations elections were already scheduled in the next three months for Manitoba.Dumas said that last week the minister let communities know that a temporary regulatory option had been introduced to allow First Nations leaders to continue in their roles for up to six months, with a potential extension for another six months.“During this pandemic, the health and well-being of Indigenous communities is our primary focus,” Miller said in a statement Thursday.Dumas said it’s the right step but it should have come much sooner.The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs is going to be recommending all communities delay elections, he said.“It’s quite a scary thing to think about what could possibly happen with having our elections.”But, ultimately, it will be up to local leadership.Smith said Brokenhead leaders considered what a delay on short notice would mean and consulted with members. Some wanted to delay, but many thought it was important to go ahead.Saturday’s vote will have extensive precautions to mitigate the risk of spreading COVID-19, she added.Each person who votes at the recreation centre will get a special personal protective equipment kit, which includes a mask, gloves, sanitizer and a pen. Only one person will be allowed in at a time and there will be Plexiglas between the voter and electoral officer.Extra security has been hired to ensure people waiting to vote stay far enough apart. Voters driving into the community will be screened for signs of illness and their recent travel history and will be required to leave immediately after.“The way things have been done in the past is considerably different than the way we are going to have to do it now,” Kent said.7:30 a.m.: Spain has reached 20,000 deaths for the coronavirus pandemic and total infections increased to more than 190,000.Spain’s health authorities reported 565 deaths in the last 24 hours. Only the United States and Italy have more deaths.New infections rose by nearly 4,500. More than 74,000 people in Spain have recovered.This week, health authorities said there were discrepancies in the statistics of virus deaths and infections reported by regional administrations. The central government has ordered regions to give more precise data and use the same parameters.As the outbreak’s spread slows, pressure on hospitals has relaxed. Authorities have closed one part of a huge field hospital with thousands of beds set up by the military in a convention centre in Madrid.But strict confinement rules are expected to be extended beyond April 26.7 a.m.: Germany, Canada, France, the U.K., South Korea and eight other nations issued a joint statement noting the “critical role” of the World Health Organization in tackling the virus outbreak.The so-called Ministerial Coordination Group on COVID-19 said a “strong and co-ordinated global health response” is needed. The U.S. is not a member of the group. President Donald Trump has criticized the WHO and ordered a halt to contributions to the organization.The 13 nations also agreed that emergency measures to tackle the virus “must be targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary.” They must not “create unnecessary barriers to trade or disruption to global supply chains” and must comply with WTO rules.4:56 a.m.: Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s chief of staff died on Friday after contracting the coronavirus in Germany. Abba Kyari, whose age wasn’t disclosed, was regarded as one of the most powerful politicians in the West African country and a strong supporter of state intervention in the economy.4:51 a.m.: Russia recorded its largest daily increase in coronavirus infections, with the new cases rising by almost 5,000 in a single day.New infections jumped by 4,785 to 36,793, the official Russian coronavirus information centre reported on its website. Forty people died in the past day, including 21 in Moscow, bringing the number of fatalities to 313. The pace of new cases increased 17.6% after slowing to less than 15% in the previous two days.4:47 a.m.: A group of thirteen countries including Britain, Brazil, Italy and Germany is calling for global co-operation to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.In a joint statement the group said it is committed to “work with all countries to co-ordinate on public health, travel, trade, economic and financial measures in order to minimize disruptions and recover stronger.”The countries emphasized the need to maintain “air, land and marine transportation links” to ensure the continued flow of goods, including medical equipment and aid, and the return home of travellers.They want key transport hubs around the world to remain open and for airlines to maintain major routes.The group — also including Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, South Korea, Singapore and Turkey — stressed “the importance and critical role of the scientific community in providing guidance to governments” and suggested pooling scientific resources. 4 a.m.: The federal government is deploying celebrities in new ads meant to amplify the plea of public health experts for Canadians to stay home to curb the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus.The ads, one in French, one in English, are to begin broadcasting nationally tonight during the “One World: Together at Home” concert.The English advertisement features astronaut Chris Hadfield and women’s hockey star Hayley Wickenheiser, alongside Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer.The trio exhorts Canadians to stay home and save lives.Hadfield says Canadians have always overcome challenges by looking out for each other and doing their part.Wickenheiser, noting that even people without symptoms can spread the disease, reminds Canadians that their actions can make the difference between life and death.The French ad conveys similar messages, using astronaut David Saint-Jacques and Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, the Canadian football star who helped the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs win the Super Bowl in February. They appear alongside Dr. Mona Nemer, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s chief science adviser.The exhortations to stay home come as federal political parties are to continue negotiating today about when and how Parliament should reconvene in the middle of the pandemic. 2:37 a.m.: A German cruise ship has left Western Australia state after a three-week stay during which three people on board died of COVID-19.The Artania began its journey from Fremantle back to Europe, keeping to its scheduled early afternoon departure time Saturday.A total of 79 crew and passengers from the Artania tested positive for coronavirus in Western Australia. They included a 42-year-old crewman from the Philippines who died in a Perth hospital on Thursday, raising the state’s toll to seven.The ship’s captain, Morten Hansen, said the crew member had been with the company since 2006 and most recently served as a motorman, describing his death as “heartbreaking.”Two other people from the Artania died last week, one a passenger in his 70s, and the other a 69-year-old crewman.Some of the crew who are expected to return home on a charter flight were removed from the ship on Saturday and transferred to a Perth hotel. The ship is expected to make stops in Indonesia and the Philippines en route to Germany.The ship had been scheduled to depart earlier this month before being granted an additional 14-day quarantine period by the Australian Border Force. Some 219 of the state’s 541 cases have been among people linked to cruise ships.1:28 a.m.: Indonesia has extended stricter social-distancing rules to millions of people living on the main island of Java, and in West Sumatra, as the world’s fourth-most populous nation strives to stem a spike in coronavirus cases.Large-scale social restrictions will be put in place across five regions in West Java that collectively house almost 9 million people, Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said in a statement issued by the Indonesian cabinet secretariat. A similar order has been given for Tegal, a city in Central Java, and for the province of West Sumatra. Putranto noted a significant increase in the spread of COVID-19 cases in these areas.There were 407 new infections in Indonesia on Friday, the biggest daily increase since the Southeast Asian country reported its first case, taking total confirmed cases close to 6,000. The government has continuously expanded a partial lockdown to more cities outside the capital Jakarta, the epicentre of the outbreak. The virus is expected to infect 95,000 people in May and to rise to 106,000 in July, according to the government estimates.The five regions in West Java include Cimahi City, Bandung Regency, West Bandung Regency, Sumedang Regency and Bandung City — the nation’s fourth-most populous city.10:10 p.m.: Millions of workers in Indonesia are planning to break social distancing rules to stage rallies across the country on April 30 in protest over an overhaul of labor-market rules, according to the Jakarta Post newspaper.Labor unions say changes to the labour rules, contained in a so-called omnibus bill currently being considered by lawmakers, legitimize the exploitation of workers. President Joko Widodo had put the bill forward as an essential reform even before the virus hit as he sought to appease those who see the labour law and generous severance pay conditions as a major barrier to investment.“The option is either to die from the coronavirus for joining a rally or die of starvation from having nothing to eat,” the paper cited Inter-Factory Labourers Federation chairwoman Jumisih as saying.7:43 p.m.: President Donald Trump said there’s enough coronavirus testing capacity to put in place his plan to allow a phased reopening of the economy, even though some state officials and business leaders have raised alarms about shortages.“We’ve already built sufficient testing capacity nationwide so states can begin their reopenings,” the president said Friday at the White House.Business leaders and lawmakers told Trump in phone calls this week that the U.S. must increase its testing capacity before attempting to reopen the economy. Trump also tweeted on Friday that “the States have to step up their TESTING!”In many parts of the country, health officials say adequate levels of testing still haven’t been reached. California has been especially hamstrung, reporting more than 7,000 backlogged tests on Friday despite massive pushes to process more tests.6:28 p.m.: Federal Minister of Transport Marc Garneau announced that as of April 20, all air passengers will be required to wear a “non-medical mask or face covering” during air travel. Travellers on flights departing or arriving at Canadian airport will be required to demonstrate they have the appropriate mask prior to boarding, otherwise they won’t be able to fly.According to the ministry, passengers travelling by bus are “strongly encouraged” to wear masks “as much as possible,” and may be asked by the operator to cover their mouths and noses when social-distancing isn’t possible."
