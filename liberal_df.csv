Ottawa, ON – The Liberal Party of Canada is heading into this fall’s election campaign supported by its best-ever second quarter for grassroots fundraising results, with more than 41,500 Canadians contributing $5,033,998 to support Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team’s progress to invest in the middle class.
A record-breaking Q2 builds on grassroots Liberals also recently achieving the party’s best-ever Q3 and Q4 fundraising results outside of an election campaign, and each of the last five months has set a new monthly best. The median donation to the Liberal Party in Q2 was just $15 at a time, and 95 percent of all donations were under $200.
“Liberals are starting this important election campaign with new records for grassroots fundraising and incredible hope and hard work by volunteers in communities across Canada,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “As we head to the polls this fall, Canadians will have a clear choice. While Conservatives want to go backward with divisive politics and cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class.”
Filings with Elections Canada also continue to highlight that Liberal supporters are getting far more value for their donations than Conservatives. Annual returns since the last campaign show that the Conservative Party spent $22,519,872 on fundraising expenses throughout 2016-2018, while the Liberal Party spent just $9,254,606.
The Liberal Party was also the first and only party to move forward with the strongest standards in federal politics for open and transparent political fundraising events. This is in clear contrast to the Conservative Party and the NDP, who have continued to bar journalists and keep Canadians in the dark about what is being said behind closed doors.
Throughout this mandate, local Liberal riding associations have also continued to outraise their Conservative counterparts by as much as 3-to-1.

Toronto, ON — Today, the Liberal Party of Canada unveiled its plan to move forward for a stronger middle class, and for a better Canada for all Canadians.
“Middle class Canadians do the heavy lifting in our economy,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “So when we choose to give more help to the middle class and the people working hard to join it, we are choosing a stronger economy. We are choosing a more affordable, more fair Canada. We are choosing a cleaner, better country for our kids and grandkids. We are choosing forward.”
Forward: A Real Plan for the Middle Class builds on the progress we’ve made investing in families, workers, and communities. Under our plan, we will cut taxes for the middle class, without giving a break to millionaires. We will ban assault rifles and strengthen gun control. And we will continue to take bold action to protect our environment and fight climate change.
“The Conservatives want to go back to the Harper years, where they give tax cuts to millionaires, loosen gun regulations, and make it free to pollute again,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Andrew Scheer doesn’t think it’s possible to grow the economy and fight climate change. He’s wrong. Our plan will create jobs, reduce pollution, and leave a healthier planet for our kids and grandkids.”
When a Liberal government is re-elected, the average family in Canada will also:

Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
Save nearly $600 a year when we lower taxes for everyone but the already wealthy;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by at least $729 when they turn 75;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments on their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

Forward: A Real Plan for the Middle Class also gives real help to the next generation of Canadian leaders. The costs of tuition, rent, books, and groceries — along with cuts to student aid by provincial Conservative governments — are putting an immense amount of pressure and stress on students.
A re-elected Liberal government will help more students prepare for good jobs while taking on less debt.

We will give students up to $1,200 more, per year, by increasing Canada Student Grants by another 40 per cent, to help with the rising cost of tuition, books, and rent; and
We will give students two years after graduation to get started before they need to begin paying off their student loans, interest free.
We will change the rules so that, even after the two year grace period, graduates won’t have to start repaying their loans until they make at least $35,000, and can put their loans on hold if their income drops below this level; and
We will allow parents to pause student loan repayments — with no interest — until their youngest child reaches the age of five. This means more money to help pay for things like baby products and child care in those important, and expensive, first years.

“Like Doug Ford, Andrew Scheer will cut support for college and university students. But what the Conservatives fail to understand is that the greatest investment we can make in our future is in education and training,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We won’t make the same mistakes. On education. On the environment. On the economy. We will not fall back and fall behind. We will move forward, and choose to lead.”

Delta, B.C. – A re-elected Liberal government will help Canadians lower their energy bills, make their homes more energy-efficient, and give them the tools to prepare for climate related disasters.
Today, many Canadians live in homes that aren’t energy efficient – which means higher utility bills and more pollution. Meanwhile, more and more homes are in danger of being destroyed from the ever-increasing number of floods and wildfires. Climate change is real, and it’s happening now. As a country we must come together to fight it, and we also need to deal with its consequences.
“It’s expensive to adapt to a changing climate. We are going to help you replace those drafty windows or your old furnace – so you can cut your utility bills and keep our environment healthy,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We have a decision to make. We can go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change, or we can fight for a better future. The choice is that clear.”
A re-elected Liberal government will make life more affordable for Canadians, cut our emissions, and protect the environment.

We will help retrofit 1.5 million homes to help Canadians make their homes more energy efficient, and better protect them from climate-related risks;
We will help homeowners and landlords pay for retrofits by giving them an interest-free loan of up to $40,000;
We will help people buy newly built homes that are certified zero-emissions by giving them a Net Zero Homes Grant of up to $5,000; and
We will invest $100 million in skills training, to ensure there are enough qualified workers to keep up with energy audits, retrofits, and net-zero home construction.

We will also be there for Canadians when disaster strikes, by:

protecting homeowners who are at high risk of flooding and don’t have adequate insurance protection, by creating a low-cost national flood insurance program;
helping Canadians better understand the risks they face when they buy a home, by working with provinces and territories to complete all flood maps in Canada;
developing a national action plan to assist homeowners with potential relocation for those at the highest risk of repeat flooding; and
help Canadians whose jobs and livelihoods are affected when disaster strikes, by working with stakeholders and experts to design an E.I. Disaster Assistance Benefit.

These measures will build on four years of climate action by our government, including:

introducing over 50 measures to fight climate change and protect our environment, from banning single-use plastics to putting a price on pollution;
investing to encourage new homes to be built carbon neutral;
helping ensure Canadians have access to the most energy-efficient appliances to help cut energy costs and support our climate action goals; and
establishing the $2 billion Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund to help communities prevent and prepare for growing climate risks.

“Andrew Scheer doesn’t have a real climate plan. He wants to make pollution free again – which would increase our emissions,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Denial is not a policy. We can go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change – or fight for a better future. I’m for moving forward.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on World Mental Health Day:
“Kids and parents. Friends and loved ones. Colleagues at work and folks in our communities. Mental health affects all of us – and that’s why we need to talk about it. Having an honest conversation, sharing our stories with compassion and openness – these are ways we can make it easier for people to reach out and get the help they need. Yet too often, fear of stigma makes people suffer in silence. World Mental Health Day is a chance to change that.
This year, World Mental Health Day focuses on suicide prevention. No family should have to go through losing a loved one to suicide. No one should have to feel hopeless because they can’t get the support they need. That’s why we’re going to set clear national standards for access to mental health services – to make sure every Canadian can get quality support quickly, when they need it most.
In Canada, too many Indigenous communities lose young people, elders, parents, and friends to suicide. Over the last four years, we’ve made important progress through initiatives like the Inuit-led National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy, but much more needs to be done. Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will work together with Indigenous peoples to create distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation, to make sure Indigenous communities have access to high quality, culturally-relevant health care and mental health services.
We’ve made mental health a priority because no one should ever have to suffer in silence. Yet too many Canadians go through these struggles without the help they need – and that’s especially true for veterans. That’s unacceptable, and that’s why we will make sure every veteran has access to high quality mental health care, when and where they need it. We will move forward with a new rapid-response service, and we will reach out to every Canadian veteran to make sure they know about the help available. We will also make it easier for veterans to get disability benefits, and give our veterans up to $3,000 in additional free counselling services before a disability claim is required.
In the past four years, our Liberal government has made major strides to advance mental health. We made Canada’s largest-ever investment in mental health, and working with the provinces and territories, we made mental health a key priority in our health accords for the first time in Canadian history.
But this is just the beginning, and we’re going to keep building on our work. A re-elected Liberal government will include mental health as a specific element of occupational health and safety in the Canada Labour Code. Understanding that addiction is closely tied to mental health, we will invest to help more people access the addiction treatment services they need. We will also strengthen support for LGBTQ2 communities, including by further investing in the mental health crisis hotline we launched earlier this year.
No matter who we are or what we do, there is no shame in struggling with a mental health issue. Mental health affects all of us, whether someone we love is suffering or we’ve gone through these struggles ourselves. Let’s work together to break down stigma, move forward, and build a healthier Canada for everyone.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Nayrouz:
“Today, Coptic Orthodox Christians in Canada and around the world will celebrate the Feast of Nayrouz and welcome the Coptic New Year.
“Also known as the Feast of Rivers, Nayrouz marks the start of Thout – the first month of the Coptic calendar. First celebrated in ancient Egypt, this festival is a time to remember Coptic Christians who were persecuted under Roman rule because of their faith.
“On Nayrouz, families and loved ones gather to pray, exchange gifts, and spend time together. As Coptic communities honour their deep history, they will reflect on the past, and look toward the year to come.
“For all of us, Nayrouz is a chance to celebrate the many contributions Coptic Christians make to our country each day. We will always stand up for the values that make Canada strong – from freedom of expression, to peace, openness, and inclusion – and make sure everyone can practice their faith freely.
“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating a joyful Nayrouz.”

2019 TVA Face-to-Face Debate.
October 3, 2019
Last night, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau underscored the choice Canadians have to make on October 21: keep moving forward with the progress achieved over the past four years or go back to the politics of the Harper years. And the responses keep coming in.
« Dans l‘avis général des analystes ce matin, s’il y a un gagnant, c’est Justin Trudeau… Juste le fait qu’il est sorti sans égratignure, est pour lui un avantage » – Jean-François Guérin, Québec Matin, 3 oct 2019
« Talonné sur l’avortement, Scheer trébuche. » – TVA Nouvelles, 2 oct 2019
« Justin Trudeau a été particulièrement incisif, interrompant son adversaire à maintes reprises sur le plateau. « Tu te caches de chaque réponse », lui a reproché le chef libéral. » – Mélanie Marquis, Fanny Lévesque, La Presse, 3 oct 2019
« Le chef libéral s’est inspiré de son sport préféré, frappant à coups redoublés, surtout sur ses deux principaux adversaires, Andrew Scheer et Yves-François Blanchet. » – Antoine Robitaille, Journal de Québec, 3 oct 2019

« Le chef conservateur Andrew Scheer a passé un premier quart d’heure difficile au premier débat en français de la campagne électorale, mercredi soir. » – Lina Dib, La Presse canadienne, 2 oct 2019
« Pour la sixième fois, @AndrewScheer refuse de dire quelle est sa position personnelle sur l’avortement.» – Louis Blouin (Radio-Canada), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
“What has Bloc done in Parliament? Have they gotten anything passed? He says Bloc works well in a minority parliament. (FWIW, Bloc MPs did virtually nothing of substance in the last Parliament.)” – John Paul Tasker, CBC News, 2 Oct 2019
“One clear loser tonight: Andrew Scheer. Got nervous over abortion and never fully recovered. Blanchet was professorial and annoying (…) Trudeau, the PM, on offensive most of the night.” – Bernard St-Laurent (Retired, CBC/Radio-Canada), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
« Au lieu du premier ministre sortant Justin Trudeau comme attendu, la principale cible a plutôt été le chef conservateur Andrew Scheer, mercredi soir, lors du premier débat des chefs télévisé en français. » – Olivier Bossé, Le Soleil, 2 oct 2019
« D’entrée de jeu, la question de l’avortement a coincé M. Scheer dans le coin du ring, d’où il n’a pu qu’encaisser les coups et laisser passer la tempête. » – Olivier Bossé, Le Soleil, 2 oct 2019
« Justin Trudeau a plutôt bien fait. Il ne devait pas trébucher, il n’a pas trébuché. » ICI RDI, 2 oct 2019
« Le chef libéral – à titre de premier ministre sortant – était dans une position beaucoup moins confortable, puisqu’il devait défendre un bilan. Il a été en mesure de le faire sans trébucher, en réussissant à envoyer quelques attaques. Il était particulièrement animé dans le dossier de l’avortement et des compressions budgétaires qu’il prétend qu’Andrew Scheer effectuerait s’il est élu. » – Fannie Olivier, Radio-Canada, 3 oct 2019
« Le chef conservateur Andrew Scheer s’est vite retrouvé sur la défensive, pilonné par un trio d’adversaires qui ont fait front commun pour tenter de lui arracher des réponses sur sa position personnelle au sujet de l’avortement. » – Mélanie Marquis et Fanny Lévesque, La Presse, 3 oct 2019
« À l’issue du premier débat des chefs en français, le chef du Parti conservateur du Canada, Andrew Scheer, a choisi de maintenir un flou sur sa position personnelle en matière de droit à l’avortement. Questionné à ce sujet en point de presse, M. Scheer a quelque peu dérogé à la phrase qu’il répète inlassablement pour assurer qu’il ne rouvrira pas ce débat. » – Roxanne Ocampo, La Presse Canadienne, 3 oct 2019
« Le premier débat des chefs aura souvent placé Andrew Scheer dans les câbles mercredi soir : que ce soit par rapport à ses positions sur des enjeux sociaux ou sur la question environnementale, il a essuyé sa part de coups de la part de ses trois adversaires qui ont tenté de dépeindre le chef conservateur comme étant en porte-à-faux des valeurs québécoises. » – Guillaume Bourgault-Côté et Hélène Buzzetti, Le Devoir, 3 oct 2019

The Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement for Women’s History Month:
“During Women’s History Month, we celebrate the achievements of women and girls throughout our history and recognize the trailblazing women who have shaped our country.
From one generation to the next, women have built the Canada we know today – but their accomplishments have often gone unrecognized. Gender equality advocates have long led efforts to change that. This year’s theme, ‘Make An Impact,’ encourages us to celebrate their work, and spotlight women everywhere who are breaking glass ceilings and transforming our world for the better.
Over the last four years, our Liberal government has followed their lead. We’re helping more people learn about women leaders throughout our history, with initiatives like making Viola Desmond the face of the $10 bill – and we’re providing more support for the community organizations that are leading the fight for gender equality. Whether it’s launching the first ever federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence, or investing to double the number of women entrepreneurs by 2025, we’ve made progress to protect women’s rights and make sure people of all gender identities have a fair and equal chance to succeed. We’ve taken up this work beyond our borders, too – from our Feminist International Assistance Policy, to major investments in sexual and reproductive health rights, and in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations.
We’ve put gender equality at the heart of our work since day one – and we’ll continue to do so. Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will create hundreds of thousands of new before and after school care spaces, nearly double federal spending on child care, and move forward to deliver guaranteed paid family leave for every new parent in Canada. Because child care still falls disproportionately to women, these measures represent an important step forward for gender equality and will make a difference for families across Canada.
We know there is much more to do to make sure women’s contributions are valued, their voices are heard, and their rights are respected – especially for the most vulnerable women. Trans women, Indigenous women, racialized women, women with disabilities, low-income women, migrant and refugee women, and people of diverse gender identities still face unequal, unacceptable obstacles – and many activists from these groups are leading the fight to change that. Their work is part of a long history of women breaking down barriers – and building a better Canada.
In 2019, we’ve seen an attack on women’s rights around the world, from the legitimization of gender-based violence, to the assault on a woman’s right to choose. Even in Canada, some politicians are intent on rolling back rights and cutting access to important services like health care and sexual assault centres. Women’s History Month reminds us that we can’t lose ground on gender equality – and we need to stand with those who are fighting for it. Today, and every day, let’s come together for a more equal world, and choose forward, for all of us.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day of Democracy:
“In every election, we get to make a choice about the future of our country. We get to decide what we want to achieve, and who we want to be as Canadians. As members of a democracy, this is our right and our responsibility. All of us can directly shape the future we want to see – for our families, our communities, and all our fellow Canadians.
“On the International Day of Democracy, we celebrate the democratic tradition that empowers us all and keeps Canada moving forward.
“Yet around the world, in 2019, democracy is increasingly under attack. And in recent years, we’ve seen an assault on journalists and the free press – the beating heart of democracy worldwide.
“It’s up to all of us to not only safeguard our democracy, but to strengthen it. That means using our vote to make our voices heard – but casting our ballot is just the beginning. From taking part in a town hall meeting, to helping our kids learn how their government works, we build our democracy together every day. The smallest of actions count.
“This fall, Canadians will once again get to vote for the kind of Canada they want to live in. While some politicians threaten to pull us backward, Canadians will have the choice to keep moving forward. We have spent the last four years building toward better. Now, we have the chance to continue that progress, together.
“Today, I urge Canadians to celebrate the power and responsibility we have – thanks to our democracy – to shape our country and our world. Let’s make the most of it, stand united, and choose forward – for all of us.”

MONTRÉAL (QC) — A re-elected Liberal government will continue to protect and grow our cultural and creative industries, and make sure more people have access to our culture.
Whether it’s the writers who tell our stories, the comedians who make us laugh, or the artists who give us the soundtrack to our lives, Canadians are proud of the creativity we share – here at home and with the rest of the world. Meanwhile, to help bring people together, it’s vital that we preserve Canadian heritage by protecting and maintaining the places that have marked our country’s history.
“Culture is on the investment list for the Liberal Party. For the Conservatives, it’s on the list of things to cut,” said Pablo Rodriguez, the Liberal candidate for Honoré–Mercier. “Culture is who we are – past, present, and future. A Liberal government will always protect and promote culture and our official languages.”

To make sure more people have access to Canadian culture, at home and around the world, and to make sure our artists can keep telling our stories, we will:
create the Culture Pass, a $200 credit that every kid will receive at age 12, to be used to discover local Canadian content;
continue to support Canadian film by increasing annual funding for Telefilm Canada by nearly 50 per cent a year;
strengthen the regional mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada, so that local stations can broadcast more local news, and
require CBC/Radio-Canada to open up its digital platform, so that journalism start-ups and community newspapers can access affordable technology to develop and distribute local content;
introduce a new Cultural Diplomacy strategy, with at least one international mission each year to promote our culture and creators around the world; and
move forward, in our first year, with legislation to ensure that all content providers – including internet giants – offer meaningful levels of Canadian content in their catalogues, contribute to the creation of Canadian content in both official languages, and promote this content on their platforms.

“Our cultural industry is at a crossroads, and it just can’t afford a Conservative mandate,” said Annie Talbot, the Liberal candidate for Portneuf–Jacques-Cartier. “It’s 2019, but our main culture and communications laws are still from before the internet. The work Janet Yale and her team are doing to examine these laws is essential. We’re looking forward to reading her final report, and if Canadians give us another mandate, we’ll quickly take the necessary measures once the report is delivered.”
“I’m deeply proud to be part of a team that stood up to the Trump administration during the NAFTA negotiations to save the cultural exemption. Meanwhile, Andrew Scheer asked the government to make concessions to get a deal more quickly,” said Geneviève Hinse, the Liberal candidate for Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie. “You can be certain that a re-elected Liberal government will keep standing up for culture.”

Ottawa, ON – The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Rosh Hashana:
“Tonight, at sunset, Jewish communities in Canada and around the world will celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.
Rosh Hashana marks the start of the High Holidays, culminating in Yom Kippur. It is a time to reflect on the past year, and turn towards the future with hope. As family and friends dip apples in honey and share special meals together, we remember what matters most – spending time with loved ones and working to build a better world.
Just like today is a chance to celebrate the many contributions of Jewish Canadians, it is also a time to recommit to fighting antisemitism, hatred, and discrimination in all their forms. For many Jewish Canadians, this year has been a difficult one. Communities in Canada and beyond have suffered violent acts of hate – acts that have no place in our country, or our world. We will always stand with the Jewish community, and stand united against hate – and together, we will make our world a better one.
Our diversity, compassion, and openness are Canada’s strengths. Today, I encourage all Canadians to reflect on how we can bring those values to life every day.
On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a joyful and peaceful New Year.
Shana Tova Umetuka!”

Toronto, ON — A re-elected Liberal government will give families an extra $1,500 every year, by cutting taxes for the middle class and lowering cell phone bills by 25 per cent.
Middle class families are feeling stretched. Taxes, fees, and bills pile up while wages are not keeping up. Cell phone bills in particular put a lot of pressure on a family’s budget, with Canadians paying up to twice as much for wireless services than people in other G7 countries. Enough is enough. It’s time for hard-working Canadians to get a bigger share of the pie.
“I’ve been talking to Canadians across the country and I keep hearing the same thing: even with our strong economy and record unemployment, it’s still tough to make ends meet,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Groceries. Cell phone bills. Child care. It all adds up. And that’s what today is all about — being there for families when they need it most.”
To start, a re-elected Liberal government will:

Ensure middle class Canadians, and the people working to join the middle class, pay no federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn — saving the average family $585 in taxes each year;
This means that about 700,000 more Canadians, including seniors and young people starting their careers, will pay no federal tax at all;
And will lift about 40,000 Canadians out of poverty.

This will be done by raising the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) by almost $2,000 for people earning under $147,000 a year.
While Andrew Scheer’s tax plan would give a bigger break to wealthier Canadians, our plan lowers taxes the most for people who make less, helps the middle class, and ensures that the wealthy don’t get an extra hand up. Our tax cut would also help lift twice as many Canadians out of poverty than the Conservatives’.
A re-elected Liberal government will also reduce the cost of wireless services by 25 percent within four years, putting $1,000 back in the pockets of the average Canadian family every year. This will be done by:

Working with telecom companies to offer plans at globally comparable prices;
Encouraging Canadian competition in the market, and allowing the CRTC to step if that competition isn’t leading to lower prices; and
Prioritizing consumer choice and affordability, and not simply the highest bidder, when awarding new wireless expansions.

“The Conservatives spent a decade cutting taxes for corporations and millionaires,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Now, Andrew Scheer’s tax cut would benefit the wealthiest more than those who need it most. We know better. Millionaires don’t need another tax break. But the middle class does.”

The leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Franco-Ontarian Day:
“Today we celebrate the rich history and significant contribution Franco-Ontarians have made to our country. On this Franco-Ontarian Day, I would like to acknowledge the largest Francophone minority community in the country.
On September 25, 1975, the beautiful Franco-Ontarian flag was raised for the first time in front of the University of Sudbury. I want to recognize the work of all those who still today defend their presence and their choice to live in French in Ontario. I also want to take the occasion to emphasize our ongoing commitment to always denounce injustice and to stand with the Franco-Ontarian community and with all Francophones.
Strengthening our official languages and the vitality of linguistic minority communities is rooted in the values of the Liberal Party of Canada. Everyday we work to make Canada a country where we can live and grow in the language of our choice.
Over the course of our mandate, we worked diligently with official language minority communities across Canada and we are proud of the work we accomplished. From our Action Plan for Official Languages which includes an historic $2.7 billion investment, to the restoration of the Court Challenges Program, the nomination of bilingual judges to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the recent memorandum of co-operation for the creation of a Francophone University in Ontario, we are and will be here for you.
As part of the modernization of the Official Languages Act, a re-elected Liberal government will continue its work and do even more. Together, we will take on important projects to benefit future generations of Francophones and Francophiles in Ontario and across Canada.”

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new radio ad to highlight the Liberals’ unmatched record when it comes to fighting for workers and protecting Canadian jobs.
“In the NAFTA negotiations, our Liberal government fought tooth and nail to protect Canadian jobs,” said Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We said we would get a good deal, and that’s exactly what we achieved.”
The new NAFTA deal preserves more than $2 billion a day in cross-border trade between Canada and the United States. During negotiations, Andrew Scheer urged Canada to fold to America’s demands — no matter the cost to our economy or middle class workers.
“We stood up to Donald Trump on trade when the Conservatives wanted Canada to back down,” said Chrystia Freeland, Liberal candidate in the Toronto riding of University—Rosedale, in the new ad. “The Conservatives told us to take any deal we could get. Capitulation is not a negotiating strategy.”
The Liberal government stood up for Canadian workers and businesses by:

negotiating strong, enforceable labour and environment chapters in the new NAFTA that will protect our workers and our environment;
securing market access for Canadian car and car parts manufacturers, which protects our auto industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports; and
successfully removing unfair section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, which put more than 33,500 Canadian jobs at risk.

“We believe in the strength of Canadian workers, and in our country’s resolve to unite against anyone who would put middle class jobs — and the communities who rely on those jobs — at risk,” added Mr. Trudeau.

Ottawa, ON — For the first time ever, young Canadians will outnumber every other voting-aged generation. They have the power to help move Canada forward, standing up against the Conservatives’ cuts and regressive politics.
Today, Liberal candidates Catherine McKenna, Harjit Sajjan and Mélanie Joly are encouraging young people to use that power and vote — especially now that it’s easier than ever, with special voting stations opening on a number of college and university campuses from today until October 9.
Up To YOUth — a campaign created by young leaders involved with the Liberal Party of Canada — is also highlighting why a re-elected Liberal government is the best choice to move Canada forward on the issues that young Canadians care most about.
“The things we’re talking about as Liberals — more affordable tuition, rent and cell phone bills, stronger actions to fight climate change — they’re resonating with young people,” said McKenna, the Liberal candidate in the riding of Ottawa Centre. “So we’re seeing more and more young people stepping up and asking how they can be partners in creating a Canada that is more fair, and more affordable, for everyone.”
In 2015, young people came out in record numbers to elect Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party — countering the idea that they care less about democracy, or are less engaged with what’s happening in the world.
“Young people care about improving the lives of others, about fighting the climate crisis, and ensuring that everyone feels welcome and accepted in Canada,” said Sajjan, the Liberal candidate in the riding of Vancouver South. “Those values are Liberal values, and young people see that.”
For example, a re-elected Liberal government will:

Give up to $1,200 more each year to students to pay for tuition, books and rent by increasing Canada Student Grants by 40 per cent;
Give students two years — interest free — before they need to begin repaying student loans, and then only if they’re earning at least $35,000.
Make life more affordable for young people, lowering cell phone bills by 25 per cent and saving first time homebuyers hundreds on their mortgage each month;
Get Canada to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, in part by planting two billion trees;
Continue to make big polluters pay, and conserving 25 per cent of Canada’s land and waters;
Protect women’s rights to make decisions about their bodies, and improve their access to health care;
Set clear national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get the support they need quickly, when they need it most;
Protect same-sex marriage, ban conversion therapy and fund more LGBTQ2 community groups;
Fight racism, and target online hate speech, exploitation, bullying and harassment; and
Make big corporations and the wealthiest one per cent of Canadians pay their fair share of taxes.

“Young people are paying attention — they know what an Andrew Scheer government will do,” said Ahuntsic-Cartierville Liberal candidate, Joly. “The very wealthiest will get to keep more money. Big polluters will get to dirty our air and water for free again. Debates we thought were over — about abortion or same-sex marriage — will resurface. Young people aren’t going to stand by and let that happen, and neither will we.”

Ottawa, ON — A re-elected Liberal government will immediately commit Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050, and will help workers prepare for the clean energy transition.
Today, Liberal candidates Catherine McKenna, Jonathan Wilkinson, and Steven Guilbeault announced that a re-elected Liberal government would immediately commit Canada to achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century, joining 65 other countries and the European Union that made the pledge at the United Nations Climate Summit on Monday. Net-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but these emissions would be offset by other actions — such as planting trees.
“The planet is burning and people are taking to the streets to demand stronger action to fight climate change,” said Liberal candidate from Laurier—Sainte-Marie, Steven Guilbeault. “The science is clear, the evidence is clear and Canadians are clear — we must step up and do even more to protect our environment. Our kids and grandkids are counting on us.”
That’s why a re-elected Liberal government will take concrete steps to lower emissions and make life more affordable for Canadians.

We will set legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to reach net-zero emissions by 2050;
We will appoint a group of scientists, economists, and experts to recommend the best path to get to net-zero;
We will exceed Canada’s 2030 emissions goal; and
We will ensure energy workers and communities can shape their own futures by introducing a Just Transition Act, giving workers access to the training, support, and new opportunities needed to succeed in the future economy.

“It is time for Canada to join governments and leading businesses around the world that have committed to net zero emissions by 2050 in order to further tackle the worsening climate crisis,” said Liberal candidate from Ottawa-Centre, Catherine McKenna. “We know that the strongest economies and businesses in the future will be those that embrace clean technologies. We will ensure that all Canadian workers are part of this transition to a cleaner, more prosperous and more sustainable future.”
These commitments build on the Liberals’ climate record that already includes over 50 measures to cut pollution and protect our environment. These include:

Banning harmful single-use plastics and microbeads;
Phasing out coal power by 2030 and investing in renewables like wind and solar;
Putting a price on carbon pollution so it’s no longer free to pollute anywhere in Canada, while putting more money back into Canadians’ pockets;
Building 1,200 public transit projects across the country;
Making zero-emission vehicles more accessible and affordable; and
Investing in energy efficiency to help families and businesses save money.

“Climate change represents an existential threat, but also an economic opportunity for countries that foster technologies that address greenhouse gas emissions,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, the Liberal candidate for North Vancouver. “We are committed to addressing this threat. Andrew Scheer, on the other hand, will do less and cost Canadians more in a plan that experts say will increase carbon pollution. We must do better.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Thanksgiving:
“Happy Thanksgiving!
Life can be hectic for all of us. And whether you’re holding it down in the kitchen or getting outside with the family, Thanksgiving is about slowing down and appreciating what really matters – like family, and friends we haven’t seen in a long time, but we pick right back up where we left off.
Thanksgiving is a chance to say thank you to the people who make a difference – whether it’s the service members who keep us safe, or our neighbour a few doors down who keeps the driveways plowed.
No one’s worried about the little things when there’s pumpkin pie to focus on. And what brings us together is so much bigger than what pulls us apart – from Canadian values, to universal health care, to the start of the hockey season. Wherever we are, being together is what counts.
We have a whole lot to be grateful for. After all, Canada’s home. We’ve got to take care of it. And that’s exactly what our team is going to do – whether it’s fighting climate change, supporting families, or putting more money in the pockets of the middle class.
On October 21st, the choice could not be more clear. So let’s do what Canadians always do. Let’s pull together and move forward.
From our family to yours, have a great Thanksgiving.”

On the Friday before the Thanksgiving long weekend, after all the Leaders’ debates have passed, and after thousands of Canadians have already cast their ballot, Andrew Scheer finally released his platform, which includes $53 billion in cuts, including $14 billion in hidden cuts.
Canadians have nothing to thank Andrew Scheer for this Thanksgiving. Here’s what people are saying about Andrew Scheer’s reckless plan:
Quotations are included in their original language
“Well this is incompetent. Infrastructure spending desperately needs to go up, not down.” – Emmett Macfarlane (University of Waterloo), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“What party releases its platform the Friday of a long weekend? One that doesn’t want too much attention focused on it would be my guess.” – Gary Mason (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Over and over again, Conservatives have demonstrated hostility towards Canada’s workers. Today, Andrew Scheer is doubling down on that hostility and seeking a mandate to cut. With a platform loaded with job-killing service cuts, it’s clear that Andrew Scheer represents an equal threat to Canadians as Stephen Harper.” – Hassan Yussuff (President of the Canadian Labour Congress), October 12, 2019
« Un gouvernement conservateur imposerait des compressions budgétaires de plusieurs dizaines de milliards de dollars dans son premier mandat. » – Philippe-Vincent Foisy et Hugo Prévost (Radio-Canada), 11 octobre, 2019
“Cities and communities across the country have an urgent need for increased investment in infrastructure. Proposed measures in this platform appear to move in the opposite direction, with fewer infrastructure dollars available year-over-year to create jobs, improve roads and bridges, and maintain the local services Canadians rely on.” – Bill Karsten (President of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities), October 11, 2019
« Assurément, pour que Montréal puisse poursuivre son élan, les partis doivent accroître leurs investissements en matière d’infrastructures et de transports en commun, notamment pour la ligne rose » – Cabinet de la Ville de Montréal (Le Devoir), 12 octobre 2019
“If what you seek is a coherent vision of conservatism in the 21st century, you will have to look elsewhere.” – Andrew Coyne (National Post), October 11, 2019
“The largest cuts are in unspecified “other operating expenses” – $14.4 billion over five years. The Conservatives suggest they can achieve that through reining in travel spending, consulting fees, and cutting down on federal office space.” – Alex Boutilier (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The second largest proposed spending cut in the platform is a plan to save $14-billion over five years on federal government operating expenses, which are not detailed in the platform.” – Marieke Walsh (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
« Ces coupes seraient plus importantes que celles du gouvernement Harper dans les années 2010 et représentent des « risques significatifs », selon l’Institut des finances publiques et de la démocratie. » – Vincent Brousseau-Pouliot (La Presse), 12 octobre 2019
“The party said shrinking the size of cubicle space for public servants could be one of the ways to save that money.” – Marieke Walsh (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The single biggest saving measure is putting off some infrastructure spending. That will save $18-billion over five years.” – David Akin (Global), Twitter, October 11, 2019
« On savait déjà que M. Scheer voulait sabrer les subventions aux entreprises et l’aide étrangère, afin de récupérer au total 3 milliards de dollars par année. On sait maintenant où il ira chercher les dizaines de milliards additionnels qui lui manquaient pour remiser l’encre rouge. Ainsi, M. Scheer propose d’amputer 18 milliards de dollars au cours des cinq prochaines années des budgets d’infrastructures. » – Hélène Buzzetti et Marie Vastel (Le Devoir), 12 octobre 2019
“Now we see why this was released late on a Friday before a long weekend. Some big cuts with few specifics.” – Don Martin (CTV News), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The Conservative plan to balance the budget includes some serious cuts, including: – Cutting $1.5 billion a year by reviewing business subsidy programs -“Prioritizing” infrastructure spending, which would eliminate $1.3 billion in 2020-21 – Cutting foreign aid by $1.5 billion” – Rachel Gilmore (CTV News), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The Conservative platform has no mention of pharmacare or a new general national prescription drug plan. Earlier this year, the Conservative health critic suggested to media they would have a plan that would fill in the gaps for people w/o insurance. It’s not there” – Cormac Mac Sweeney (CityNews), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Vote for me and I’ll shrink your cubicle!” – Stephen Maher (Maclean’s), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Canadian govt controls 38,341 buildings. If Conservatives seriously want to pare back this number, they’ll start with, um, military. Smaller barracks? Munitions bunk beds?” – Jason Markusoff (Maclean’s), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“I’ve avoided the Doug Ford – Andrew Scheer comparisons because they’re definitely different people but the details coming out about the CPC fiscal plans, particularly on the cutting side, are eerily Ford-esque.” – Emmett Macfarlane (University of Waterloo), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“No #pharmacare plan; no plan to take on Big Pharma and reduce prescription drug costs. So much for @CPC_HQ and @AndrewScheer ‘putting everyday Canadians first’.” – Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, Twitter, October 11, 2019
“I think the prospect of the Conservatives saving $22 billion from “operating reductions” or $11 billion from cracking down on tax cheats is as likely to succeed as Scheer ordering the Salish Sea to reverse itself.” – John Ivison (National Post), October 12, 2019
« Le retour à l’équilibre budgétaire ne se fera pas sans compressions. Andrew Scheer prévoit couper dans les investissements en infrastructures à hauteur de 18 G$ sur cinq ans. À cela s’ajoutent 14 G$ en réduction des dépenses de fonctionnement… » – Guillaume St-Pierre (Journal de Montréal), 12 octobre 2019
“Tory costing of a carbon tax repeal. Apparently over five years, the net cost to the Government of giving up THIS MASSIVE TAX HIKE TAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF CANADIANS’ POCKETS is actually only about $180M. Imagine that.” – Alex Usher (Higher Education Strategy Associates), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The Conservative party says it will cut $18-billion in infrastructure spending days after Mr. Scheer criticized the Liberals for not spending enough on infrastructure.” – Denise Balkissoon (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“There’s about $53 million in cuts, so changes that [the Conservatives] say are savings but are essentially cuts to different programs.” – Annie Bergeron Oliver (CTV Power Play), October 11, 2019
“Friday afternoon release, just ahead of a long weekend, that usually means bad news and the conservative blueprint for governing which came out less than an hour ago shows some startling ways to cut spending that had not been disclosed before.” – Don Martin (CTV Power Play), October 11, 2019
“This is Harper’s cuts on steroids. It’s going to hurt Canadians and the public services they rely on. Once again, Conservatives are trying to eliminate the evidence that’s required to create sound policy for all of Canada.” – Debi Daviau (President of Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada), Twitter, October 11, 2019
« Les troupes de M. Scheer comptent prioriser les dépenses faites par le fédéral en infrastructure, apprend-on dans le cadre financier des conservateurs. Ces derniers entendent ainsi aller chercher 1,3 milliard $ dès 2020-2021. Au terme de cinq ans, les conservateurs pensent ainsi pouvoir mettre de côté un total de 18 milliards $. Ce montant élevé a surpris l’experte en finances publiques Geneviève Tellier, de l’Université d’Ottawa. «C’est quand même majeur. Il va y avoir des projets qui n’auront pas lieu», croit-elle. » – Émilie Bergeron (TVA Nouvelles), 11 octobre 2019
“I think there are a lot of people and economists questioning whether this budget is putting too much emphasis on trying to find savings of balancing the budget instead of putting money into the economy.” – Annie Bergeron Oliver (CTV Power Play), October 11, 2019
“[The Conservatives] are going to have to lay off public services to get those sorts of savings.” – Kevin Page (Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy), CBC Power & Politics, Twitter, October 11, 2019
“@CPC_HQ costed platform has no funding for a national dementia strategy. We’ve asked @AndrewScheer how his party, if elected, will meet the government’s statutory obligation to implement a national strategy, without funding? “ – Dementia Justice, Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Andrew Scheer is promising to slash infrastructure spending… The Conservatives employed a series of fictions to pretend the infrastructure cuts – the single largest budget-balancing measure in the Conservative platform – aren’t really cuts.” – Campbell Clark (Globe and Mail), October 11, 2019
“I’ve read the Conservative Party platform and am disappointed to not see any direct mention of First Nations people. Increased investments are critical to First Nations’ success, which is why the Conservatives need to publicly explain how they will support our priorities. First Nations priorities are Canada’s priorities, and if focused on and implemented they will result in a better Canada for everyone.” – Perry Bellegarde, National Chief, Assembly of First Nations, Twitter, October 11, 2019
« Les conservateurs repoussent les projets d’infrastructure pour atteindre l’équilibre » – La Presse Canadienne, 11 octobre 2019
“The Conservatives intend to make major spending cuts, if elected.” – John Ivison (National Post), October 12, 2019
“Conservative leader Andrew Scheer revealing election platform in Delta— the key is how he plans to bring the budget back to balance in five years. That involves $53-billion in cuts.” – Martin MacMahon (NEWS 1130), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“On the Manitoba side, the federal Tory platform doesn’t mention Manitoba Hydro at all in talk of the electricity corridor (hydro and pipeline right-of-way). Quebec gets even more sway in immigration but nothing about boosting the provincial-nominee quota despite MB seeking more.” – Dylan Robertson (Winnipeg Free Press), Twitter, October 11, 2019

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released three new TV ads to highlight that a re-elected Liberal government will continue to take decisive action to fight the climate crisis.
“In October, you get to choose. We can go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change – or fight for a better future,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, in one of the new ads. “I’m for moving forward for everyone. It’s that clear – and it’s that important. The future of our planet is at stake.”
The ads launch comes at the start of Global Climate Action Week. In the coming days, we will announce further ambitious action to combat the climate crisis – the defining global issue of our time. The science is clear, the evidence is clear, and Canadians are clear – we must step up and protect our environment. Our kids and grandkids are counting on us.
Over the last four years, the Liberal government took significant action to protect our environment for generations to come, including:

putting a price on the pollution that causes climate change;
banning harmful single-use plastics;
protecting nearly 14 per cent of Canada’s coasts and marine areas;
building 1,200 public transit projects across the country;
making zero-emission vehicles more accessible and affordable;
investing in energy efficiency to help families and businesses save money;
committing to phase out coal power by 2030, and investing in renewables like wind and solar;
safeguarding our oceans and coasts with our historic Oceans Protection Plan; and
making the largest conservation investments in Canadian history.

“A better future doesn’t just happen. We make it happen,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Andrew Scheer doesn’t think it’s possible to grow the economy and fight climate change. He’s wrong. Our plan will create jobs, reduce pollution, and leave a healthier planet for our kids and grandkids.”

Ottawa, ON – The Liberal Party of Canada has achieved a record-breaking third quarter for support from grassroots donors, with a new Q3 high of 53,341 Canadians chipping in $7,276, 261 to support Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team’s plan to invest in the middle class.
“In the Q3 that led into the 2019 general election, more Canadians than ever before chipped in to support Justin Trudeau and hardworking Liberal volunteers and campaigns across Canada,” said Azam Ishmael, National Director of the Liberal Party of Canada. “On October 21, Canadians sent the Liberal team back to Ottawa with a mandate to make life more affordable, to continue to fight climate change, and get guns off our streets. We’ve made real progress for Canadians over these past four years, and working together, there’s much more to do.”
The median donation to the Liberal Party in Q3 was just $20 at a time, and 93 percent of all donations were under $200. There are also now more active monthly grassroots donors to the Liberal Party of Canada than at any other time in the party’s history, building on the continued success of local EDAs out-fundraising their Conservative counterparts at a margin of nearly 2-to-1.
Filings with Elections Canada also continue to highlight that Liberal supporters are getting far more value for their donations than Conservatives. Annual returns since 2015 show that the Conservative Party spent $22,519,872 on fundraising expenses throughout 2016-2018, while the Liberal Party spent just $9,254,606.

Papineau, QC – With eight weeks until Canadians head to the polls, Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada are launching an innovative new advertising and digital engagement campaign focused on the choice facing Canadians in October’s important election.
A series of new national ads featuring Justin Trudeau will begin airing on television this week, as part of a comprehensive and digitally-integrated advertising experience that also includes a large-scale online campaign, a new website, and featured stories from Canadians who have a personal connection to Canada’s progress since 2015. It also includes the launch of the Liberal Party of Canada’s official 2019 campaign theme: Choose Forward.
“The Conservatives like to say they’re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else,” says Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. “In October, we’ve got a choice to make: Keep moving forward and build on the progress we’ve made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years. I’m for moving forward — for everyone.”
Justin Trudeau highlights how Conservative politicians have consistently opposed the Liberal government’s progress to help people, including:

Raising taxes on the wealthiest one percent, so we could lower taxes for the middle class
Creating the Canada Child Benefit, which gives hundreds of dollars each month tax-free to families across Canada
A real plan to fight climate change that will reduce pollution and put more money in Canadians’ pockets

Canadians will have an important choice to make in this fall’s election. While Conservatives are focused on going backward with cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class.

Ottawa, ON — On the debate stage tonight, Justin Trudeau proved that the Liberal plan is the only credible choice for Canadians who want more money in their pockets, a cleaner environment, and safer communities.
Andrew Scheer spent the entire night attacking Justin Trudeau, while Mr. Trudeau stayed focused on what matters most — giving more help to the middle class and the people working hard to join it.
“Canadians want to know why Andrew Scheer is offering millionaires a $50,000 tax break, and 17 billion dollars in cuts for everybody else,” said Mr. Trudeau.
Andrew Scheer doubled down on his flawed plan to give tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthiest one per cent. Our plan will lower taxes for those who need a break, saving middle class families almost $600 a year, without giving a cent to millionaires.
The debate also showed Canadians once again that the Conservatives have no plan to fight climate change. Andrew Scheer made it clear that he doesn’t think it’s possible to grow the economy and fight climate change. The first thing he would do — his first action as Prime Minister — would be to tear up our plan to fight climate change, taking back the money we’ve put in Canadians’ pockets. He is wrong. We will create jobs, reduce pollution, and leave a healthier planet for our kids and grandkids.
“Conservative premiers have gotten elected on promises to do nothing on climate change, and we need a strong federal government to fight them to make sure we are moving forward on protecting future generations from climate change,” said Mr. Trudeau.
Tonight’s debate made the thing crystal clear: the other parties are either unable — or unwilling — to move us forward. Only Liberals have the plan, and the team, to keep Canada moving forward, for everyone.

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Global Dignity Day:
“Today, young people, students, teachers, and volunteers around the world will come together to celebrate the dignity inherent in all of us.
Global Dignity Day reminds us that everyone has the right to live in dignity. It’s about building a world where compassion and kindness win out over division and injustice – a world where everyone has a real and fair shot at success.
Advocates are working every day to build that world – and young people are leading that charge. Around the planet, they’re deepening our connections and creating a stronger global community – encouraging everyone to look beyond what divides us and celebrate the humanity we all share.
We have a lot to learn from our youngest leaders, who challenge us every day to do better and be better. Each day, we have the chance to make a difference, and put into practice values like kindness, generosity, openness, and respect. Even the smallest of actions can touch hearts and change lives.
As one of Global Dignity’s National Role Models, I encourage everyone to honour the inherent worth of others – today and every day. Let’s celebrate everything that unites us and lift each other up. Let’s look forward with hope – and move forward together.”

MONTREAL, QC – Tonight, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, presented an ambitious plan to strengthen the middle class, protect the environment and grow the economy. In a few weeks, Canadians will have a choice: go back to the cuts and austerity of the Harper years, or move forward for a better future.
“We have to move forward because our planet is burning. We have to move forward because people are having a hard time making ends meet. We have to move forward because our culture, and fundamental rights like gender equality, are under threat,” said Justin Trudeau. “And to do so, we need to have Quebec represented in government.”
The debate made one thing clear: Andrew Scheer and Conservatives like Doug Ford and Jason Kenney have no plan for the environment. They reject science and want to go back to a time when pollution was free. Liberals know climate change is real, and we’re putting in place concrete solutions to fight the climate crisis, adapt to a warming planet, and protect our environment.
Justin Trudeau also underscored that a re-elected Liberal government will continue to invest in Canada’s cultural and creative industries. We will increase funding for Telefilm Canada, strengthen the regional mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada, and move forward with legislation to ensure internet giants promote Canadian content. Andrew Scheer will cut taxes for the wealthy by cutting funding for Canada’s cultural industry – just like Stephen Harper.
The debate was also a reminder that the Liberal Party is the party of Francophones. Andrew Scheer refused to stand up to Doug Ford when he cut services for Franco-Ontarians. He’s already shown us that he won’t defend Francophone rights.
Justin Trudeau also stressed that a diverse and open Canada is a stronger Canada. New Canadians help our communities succeed, and they also help address the labour shortage that threatens the growth of our economy.
“In a few weeks, Quebecers — and all Canadians — will have a choice. We can choose a party that’s unwilling to move forward, because it doesn’t share our values. We can choose a party that’s unable to move forward, because it’s aiming for the opposition. Or we can choose the Liberal party, and keep moving forward – for the environment, the middle class, and our fundamental rights. On October 21st, let’s choose forward, together.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Armenia’s Independence Day:
“Today, we join Armenian communities across Canada and around the world to celebrate the anniversary of Armenia’s independence.
Canada and Armenia are bound by shared values of justice, democracy, and freedom, as well as our work together in international organizations like La Francophonie.
Last year, I had the chance to visit Armenia and meet with Prime Minister Pashinyan to discuss further strengthening our bilateral relationship through travel, tourism, and trade. The visit shone a light on the close ties between Canadians and Armenians – ties that are at the heart of our relationship.
In Canada, we know that diversity is our strength, and every day, the 60,000-strong Armenian Canadian community contributes to our country’s success. When Armenian Canadians welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees, they showed the way forward with compassion and generosity. We share a commitment to the successful settlement and integration of all newcomers.
On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish a happy Armenian Independence Day to everyone celebrating.”

Gatineau, QC – Tonight, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, showed once again that the Liberals are the only party with a credible plan for the environment, the economy, and middle-class families.
“What we saw in 2015 was that Quebecers and Canadians chose to be part of a government. That’s what ended Mr. Harper’s 10 years of not investing in culture and cutting everywhere, said the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, during the debate. We will always stand up for our values ​​and principles, such as the right of women to choose and the rights of Francophones across Canada. That’s what we will always do.”
Once again, the debate made it clear that Andrew Scheer is completely disconnected from the reality of Quebecers and Francophone communities across the country. His divisive policies and negative tone offer nothing concrete for young people, middle-class families, and seniors. We know that the Conservatives’ phantom platform will give $50,000 in tax credits to millionaires, but with only a few days left until the election, we still don’t know which services they will cut.
Just like we’ve done for the last four years, the Liberal Party is choosing to invest in middle-class families by putting even more money back in their pockets, whether by cutting their taxes or lowering their cell phone bills.
Justin Trudeau also took the opportunity to remind Canadians that the Liberal Party is the only one with a credible plan to fight climate change while creating good jobs — from planting two billion trees, to helping Canadians retrofit their homes to make them more energy-efficient.
Finally, Justin Trudeau reaffirmed that a diverse and open Canada is a stronger Canada. Newcomers grow our economy, strengthen our communities, and help reduce labour shortages.
“In a few days, Quebecers — and all Canadians — will have a choice to make about the future of our country,” said Justin Trudeau. “If the environment, the rising cost of living, and gun control matter to you, the Liberal Party is the party that will deliver. It’s by electing people to government — not to the opposition benches — that we can make progress. On October 21, let’s pull together and continue to move forward.”

It’s now been a week since Andrew Scheer tried to slip his cuts plan by Canadians, hoping they wouldn’t notice. But no one fell for it. Every day, Canadians are asking what Andrew Scheer’s cut plans means for their communities. Here is what some of them are saying:
Quotations are included in their original language
“Trudeau and the Liberals have accomplished important things since 2015. And they offer the best program for continuing in that positive direction over the next four years.” – Toronto Star Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
« Andrew Scheer ne semble pas particulièrement fier de son cadre financier. Il l’a rendu public quelques heures après le dernier débat des chefs, juste avant un long week-end où l’annonce serait forcément noyée. Qu’y retrouve-t-on, au juste ? Une feuille de route qui ressemble à celle de son prédécesseur, Stephen Harper. » – François Cardinal, La Presse, 18 octobre 2019
« [La plan d’Andrew Scheer] l’oblige évidemment à multiplier les compressions pour espérer atteindre l’équilibre budgétaire en cinq ans. Des compressions dans les infrastructures, la sécurité nationale et l’environnement, entre autres, qui s’annoncent… plus importantes que celles imposées par M. Harper. Ce qui risque d’avoir un effet concret réel, notamment en matière d’investissements en transports en commun. » – François Cardinal, La Presse, 18 octobre 2019
“[T]he government made a fundamental choice at the beginning of its mandate to make sure the wealth is more evenly shared. It cut taxes on the middle class, raised them on the wealthy and directed a lot more support to families with the new Canada Child Benefit. All that made a huge difference in the lives of many people, especially those on low incomes. The child benefit, in particular, is a key reason why more than 800,000 people, including some 300,000 children, have escaped poverty over the past few years. This is no small thing; it simply wouldn’t have happened if the Conservatives had remained in power and put austerity ahead of people.” – Toronto Star Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“On housing Andrew Scheer would move us backwards and make housing less affordable. On transit Andrew Scheer’s $18B cut to infrastructure would kill SkyTrain to UBC. On opioids Andrew Scheer would drag us back into court while more people die.” – Kennedy Stewart (Mayor of Vancouver), Statement, October 16, 2019
“There are shortcomings in [the Conservative] platform that are of concern to me.” – John Tory (Mayor of Toronto), Toronto Star, October 17, 2019
“[Andrew Scheer’s proposed] postponement of infrastructure investments is something that is not in the best interests of Toronto or cities across the country” and [Conservatives haven’t] “said as much about housing” [as other parties]. – John Tory (Mayor of Toronto), Toronto Star, October 17, 2019
“[Conservatives] would slash $18 billion from infrastructure spending, killing or delaying badly needed projects across the country. They would cut deeply in spending on government operations, a promise reminiscent of Doug Ford’s pledge to cut “fat.” We know how that’s turning out in Ontario. Under Scheer, the Conservatives would lurch to the right in foreign affairs. And, crucially, they would throw the government into reverse when it comes to effective action on climate change.” – Toronto Star Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“Liberal management of the economy has led to near record low unemployment, strong job creation and needed infrastructure investment. The Conservative claim to superiority is largely around promised tax cuts, but the truth is that tax cuts alone have not in the past generated comparable economic strength and sustained prosperity.” – Hamilton Spectator Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“The Liberals also chose to spread wealth more evenly. Taxes on the middle class were reduced and the Canada Child Benefit was introduced. Thanks to the CCB, 800,000 people, including 300,000 children, have been lifted out of poverty. This would not have happened under an austerity-driven Conservative government.” – Hamilton Spectator Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“The Conservatives would kill the carbon tax, tax big polluters and encourage green innovation. That, as numerous scientists have pointed out, isn’t even a plan. Under Scheer’s Conservatives, Canada would move backwards, which would be shirking our responsibility to future generations.” – Hamilton Spectator Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
« Contrairement à ce qu’il affirmait cette semaine, l’engagement du chef conservateur Andrew Scheer à financer ses promesses en réduisant les investissements prévus dans les infrastructures menace la construction d’un tramway à Québec, en plus de certains projets prévus à Montréal. » – Claude Villeneuve, Journal de Montréal, 18 octobre, 2019
« Si on réduit les investissements totaux en infrastructures, nécessairement, Montréal aura moins. À la ville, on évalue que c’est une somme de 1,6 milliard qui est en jeu, ce qui compromettrait la réalisation de projets de 4 milliards financés conjointement avec Québec. » – Claude Villeneuve, Journal de Montréal, 18 octobre, 2019

Mississauga, ON – Today Andrew Scheer revealed his deep cuts will target $7.5 billion in direct support for jobs and workers across the country.
“Andrew Scheer needs to tell Canadians what jobs and workers he will target. Will he cut support for 6,900 steel workers in Hamilton, 200 aerospace workers in Nova Scotia, 2,100 steel workers in Regina and across Western Canada, or 450 cleantech jobs in British Columbia?” said Liberal candidate for Markham—Thornhill, Mary Ng. “Andrew Scheer is doing exactly what Conservative politicians do; they pretend they’re for the people during the election, then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everyone else – in this case, thousands of jobs across the country.”
“Included in Andrew Scheer’s announcement today are steel workers across Canada. In the face of punishing U.S. steel tariffs, Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government invested $100 million to protect 6,900 steel jobs in Hamilton alone. Andrew Scheer just turned his back on those steel workers,” said Ng.
“Andrew Scheer today promised he will cut $7.5 billion in jobs support – but his math doesn’t add up. What else will he cut?” said Ng. “Like Doug Ford, Andrew Scheer is promising cuts on a five-year timeline to balance the budget. The problem is that today’s announcement is far from the $39 billion he needs to cut to pay for all his campaign announcements so far.”

Today, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, issued the following statement on the start of Gender Equality Week:
Gender equality benefits all of us. When everyone has a fair and equal chance to succeed, we all do better – whether it’s building peace, fighting the climate crisis, or growing economies that work for everyone. We all have a role to play to make that a reality, and Gender Equality Week is a chance to move forward.
Just this past week, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will create hundreds of thousands of new before and after school care spaces, nearly double federal spending on child care, and move forward to deliver guaranteed paid family leave for every new parent in Canada. Because child care still falls disproportionately to women, these measures represent an important step forward for gender equality and will make a difference for families across Canada.
Our Liberal government has put gender equality at the heart of our work since day one. Over the last four years, we took historic steps to advance the rights of women, girls, and people of all gender identities. We passed unprecedented pay equity legislation, and legislation that added gender identity and expression as a protected ground in the Canada Human Rights Act. We took action to promote women’s leadership on boards and in the C-suite, and boosted support for women entrepreneurs with a plan to double the number of women entrepreneurs by 2025. We also created the first ever federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence, and with our National Housing Strategy, we’ve created more than 7,000 shelter spaces for survivors of family violence, and are making sure women, their families and their kids have access to safe, affordable housing.
Beyond our borders, we launched Canada’s first Feminist International Assistance Policy, which puts the empowerment, education, and health of women and girls at the centre of all our development assistance. We created the first ever Gender Equality Advisory Council to the G7 – and thanks to their leadership, we delivered a historic investment in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations. This summer, we also announced an unprecedented investment to protect the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls everywhere, including universal access to family planning, contraception, comprehensive sexuality education, and access to safe and legal abortion and post-abortion care. Canada also co-chaired the Equal Rights Coalition, the first intergovernmental network formed to promote and protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people around the world.
But there is still so much more to do. Women’s rights and gender equality are under attack around the world, from the legitimization of gender-based violence, to the assault on a woman’s right to choose. Trans women, Indigenous women, racialized women, women with disabilities, low-income women, migrant and refugee women, and people of diverse gender identities still face unequal, unacceptable barriers. That has to change.
We’re going to take up that work, just as we’ve done so far. Even in Canada, while some politicians are intent on rolling back rights and cutting access to important services like health care and sexual assault centres, Gender Equality Week reminds us that we have the choice to keep moving forward. Let’s stand united, work together, and build a more equal Canada, and a better world for everyone.

Trois-Rivières, QC — A re-elected Liberal government will make it easier and more affordable for hard-working Canadians to start and grow their own businesses.
Right now, seven out of every ten Canadians work for small and medium-sized businesses — making them Canada’s largest employers and drivers of our economy. Yet for too many entrepreneurs, the costs of doing business is a barrier.
“After a decade of stalled economic growth and unemployment under the Conservatives, Canada’s economy has rebounded — largely thanks to the hard work of Canadians who started their own businesses,” said Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “To keep that momentum moving forward, we cut the small business tax rate and now we’re making it possible for anyone with a good idea and a passion for what they do to start their own business and support their communities.”
In addition to cutting the small business tax rate from 11 per cent to 9 per cent, a re-elected Liberal government will remove barriers to success by cutting fees, reducing red tape, and creating funds for new business owners to find support. We will also:

provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs a year with as much as $50,000 to launch a new business;
give $250 to every new business looking to expand their online services;
eliminate all fees from the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), Export Development Canada (EDC), and Farm Credit Canada, for business advisory services like mentorship and training;
cut the cost of federal incorporation by 75 per cent; and
eliminate the “swipe fee” on HST and GST for credit transactions — which will save businesses nearly $500 million a year in fees, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

These measures build on four years of strong Liberal support for small- and medium-sized businesses in Canada, including:

cutting the small business tax rate to nine per cent — the lowest rate in the G7 — which saves businesses as much as $7,500 per year;
allowing businesses to write-off job creating investments;
making regulations smarter and eliminating unnecessary and outdated regulations; and
opening up new markets for businesses by introducing the Export Diversification Strategy.

“More support for the wealthiest one percent won’t help the average Canadian get ahead,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Only Liberals have a plan to keep moving forward and give everyone a chance to succeed.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty:
“On International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, we come together to fight poverty and build a more just and equal future for people everywhere.
This year’s theme, Acting Together to Empower Children, their Families, and their Communities to End Poverty, highlights the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. No kid should grow up hungry, or without a safe place to live – but this is the reality for many of the world’s most vulnerable children. We need to do more to change that, and that’s why we’re working to break the cycles of poverty by investing in education at home and around the world. Under our G7 presidency, we worked with partners to announce a historic investment of $3.8 billion in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations – the largest of its kind ever made. Building on this success, we later welcomed another investment of $527 million, to help developing countries give every child access to quality education and modern skills training. And a few weeks ago, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will commit at least ten per cent of our international assistance to education, and lead global efforts to make sure kids growing up in refugee or displacement camps get the education they need and deserve.
Here in Canada, our Liberal government has worked hard to fight poverty and support kids and families. With measures like the Canada Child Benefit and the Poverty Reduction Strategy, our Liberal government lifted 900,000 people out of poverty – including 50,000 seniors and 300,000 kids. Unemployment is at its lowest since the 1970s – and since 2015, Canadians have created over a million new jobs. And that’s because we rejected Conservative cuts and austerity, and chose instead to invest in the middle class and people working hard to join it.
We’ve put more money in people’s pockets by cutting taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest one percent. We stopped sending child benefit cheques to millionaires, so we could send more to the single parent working two jobs, or the family of five who falls a bit short at the end of the month. We made the Canada Pension Plan even stronger, because in a country like ours, seniors shouldn’t struggle to make ends meet.
This kind of progress has been possible because Canadians chose a government that was willing to invest in people and families. The International Day for Eradication of Poverty reminds us how important that work is – and how much more we need to do to make life better for the most vulnerable. On October 21st, Canadians will once again make a choice about our future. Let’s stand united, choose forward, and keep building a better Canada for everyone.”

Toronto, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new radio ad to highlight that a re-elected Liberal government will ban assault rifles and continue to take serious, common-sense action to strengthen gun control.
“I spent decades working to keep my city safe and I know that the presence of a gun in a dangerous situation can make it deadly,” said Bill Blair, former Toronto Chief of Police and Liberal candidate for Scarborough Southwest, in the new ad. “We are going to do something about it with stronger gun control laws and a ban on assault rifles. The Conservatives talk tough but they won’t do what needs to be done. Soon, you’ll have a choice. Let the Conservatives weaken our gun control laws or make your communities safer by making gun laws stronger.”
Gun crime in Canada is on the rise, and today, our country has no clear classification for assault rifles — making it legal to buy several military-style weapons. With Bill C-71, we took important steps to make our communities safer, but we need to continue to take serious, common-sense action to strengthen gun control.
“Too many people have lost loved ones to gun violence. And too often, the culprit is military-style weapons designed to inflict mass human casualties — guns so dangerous that they have no place in our country,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Thoughts and prayers aren’t going to cut it. A Liberal government will strengthen gun control, and ban assault weapons in Canada.”

Last week, we announced important steps a re-elected Liberal government will take to strengthen gun control in Canada, including:
banning all military-style assault rifles, including the AR-15;
working with the provinces and territories to give municipalities the ability to further restrict — or ban — handguns; and
protecting the rights of law-abiding hunters and pledge not to bring back the long-gun registry. Hunters do not use or need assault weapons;
preventing people suspected of posing a danger to themselves or others — including their partners or kids — from possessing or acquiring new firearms;
requiring that everyone importing ammunition must show proof of a valid firearms license; and
making it harder for legal weapons to fall into the hands of criminals, by further strengthening safe-storage laws.

“Andrew Scheer’s policy on guns was written by the gun lobby. He has an agenda that will make it easier for criminals to get their hands on assault rifles,” said Mr. Trudeau. “It is shameful. We want stronger gun laws. The Conservatives want weaker ones. The choice is clear.”

Sherbrooke, QC – Justin Trudeau will join local Liberals for Élisabeth Brière’s Team Trudeau 2019 nomination event for Sherbrooke on August 20, 2019.
Élisabeth Brière is a community leader with deep roots in Sherbrooke. She is a notary for Monty Sylvestre and has been a lecturer at the Université de Sherbrooke since 1995, and she is committed to giving back to her community through public service.
In this fall’s important election, Québecers and all Canadians will have a clear choice. While Conservatives want to go backward with austerity and cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class. More than 53,000 Québecers have registered as new Liberals since the last election – and that grassroots support is continuing to grow every day.

Sudbury, ON — A re-elected Liberal government will protect 25 per cent of Canada’s land and 25 per cent of Canada’s oceans by 2025, as well as give every kid in Canada the chance to learn to camp.
Canada has the longest coastline in the world, one-fifth of the world’s fresh water, and vast and wild forests — but climate change puts them all at risk. It’s more important than ever to protect the natural landscape we know and love. At the same time, Canadians of all ages should have the chance to enjoy our natural wonders and learn more about our country.
“We have listened to the courageous voices of young people who are demanding that their governments take bold action to protect our nature for future generations,” said Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “And we know that we raise environmental champions by helping the next generation experience Canada’s natural beauty firsthand.”
A re-elected Liberal will continue down the path of conservation and environmental protection:

We will conserve and protect 25 per cent of Canada’s land and 25 per cent of Canada’s oceans by 2025, working towards 30 per cent of each by 2030;
We will ground these efforts in science, Indigenous knowledge, and local perspectives;
We will also advocate for countries around the world to set a 30 per cent conservation goal as well;
We will give every child the chance to learn how to camp by the time they reach grade eight, expanding the successful Learn to Camp program:
This will make it possible for 400,000 kids each year to learn the skills to enjoy camping; and
We will give 75,000 less privileged children and their families an up to four night trip to one of Canada’s National or Provincial Parks:
This includes camping accommodations and a travel bursary of up to $2,000 so that families can more easily afford a once-in-a-lifetime trip to more national parks like Banff, Gros Morne, Forillon and the Cape Breton Highlands.

This builds on a strong Liberal tradition of protecting Canada’s land and oceans, including:

Making the largest investment in nature conservation in Canadian history;
Conserving land areas equal to about 3.5 times the size of Nova Scotia;
Boosting the amount of protected coastal and ocean areas from 1 per cent to 14 per cent;
Creating Rouge National Urban Park, North America’s largest urban park, and the Edéhzhíe Protected Area, the first Indigenous protected area;
Working in partnership with Inuit to protect the Arctic’s last year-round sea ice, as well as sensitive areas in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and glass sponge reefs off the coast of British Columbia.

“The Conservatives spent a decade starving Parks Canada of funding, and ripping up protections for nearly all Canadian waters,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We only get one planet, and one Canada. Let’s protect it, for our kids and grandkids to enjoy — today and for years to come.”

Ottawa, ON – In October, Canadians have a choice to make about the future of our country: keep moving forward and building on the progress we’ve made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years.
In 2015, after a decade of failed Conservative policy, Canada’s economy was sputtering. Economic growth, job creation, and wages were all stalled – thanks to a Conservative government that believed you could cut your way to prosperity.
“Canadians were tired of a Harper government that promised prosperity, and delivered the opposite. So in 2015, they chose a team that was willing to invest in people and their communities. We live in the best country in the world, but better is always possible,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “And while there’s more work ahead of us than behind us, we have spent the last four years building toward better – and we’ve got the record to show for it.”
Over the last four years, our Liberal government made investments that made a real difference in people’s lives:

We’ve put more money in people’s pockets by cutting taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest one percent;
We stopped sending child benefit cheques to millionaires, so we could send more to the single parent working two jobs, and to the family of five that falls a bit short at the end of the month;
We made the Canada Pension Plan even stronger, because in a country like ours, seniors shouldn’t struggle to make ends meet; and
We’re protecting our nature, and ensuring that our air stays clean and our water stays safe – because we owe it to our kids, and to ourselves, to take care of our environment.

Since 2015, Canadians have created over a million new jobs. The new Canada Child Benefit is helping parents pay for healthier groceries, summer camp, and school supplies. We’ve lifted 900,000 Canadians out of poverty – and that includes over 300,000 kids. And this fall, Canadians once again get to vote for the kind of Canada they want to live in.
“Conservatives like to say they’re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Our government has chosen to move Canada forward by investing in families, workers, and communities. On October 21st, let’s stand united, and let’s choose forward – for a stronger middle class, and for a better Canada for all Canadians.”

Ottawa, ON – Liberal M.P. , the Hon. Carolyn Bennett, issued the following statement today:
“In December, First Nations Chiefs asked Andrew Scheer what his policy toward the spirit of reconciliation would be. How would he differ from his Conservative predecessors?
“They were not happy to hear his response that they should have patience and wait for his platform.
“Andrew Scheer has now completed his five “major policy speeches,” outlining his party’s next election platform. The word “reconciliation,” was not uttered once.
“His silence on this issue is not only disrespectful, it is totally irresponsible. There are more than 1.6 million First Nations, Inuit and Métis in Canada, and they are the fastest growing population. A “vision” for Canada that does not include a plan to recognize and implement the rights of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, or to close the socioeconomic gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples is completely unacceptable.
“Meanwhile, Andrew Scheer’s Conservative Senators are blocking Bill C-262, an important piece of legislation that would ensure that Canada’s laws respect the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Since they refuse to let this legislation pass, the Liberal Party will make it part of our election platform this fall.
“Andrew Scheer is applying to be the leader of our country. He has a responsibility to understand the issues facing the First Peoples of this country and work with First Nations, Inuit and Métis in order to come to the table with a real plan to address their priorities.
“Canadians have supported and are working towards a new relationship with indigenous peoples based upon the recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership.
“With his final policy speech yesterday, Andrew Scheer has confirmed what Canadians have long suspected: Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is not part of his Vision for Canada.
“Stephen Harper did not work with Indigenous peoples to advance reconciliation and demonstrated that he thought Ottawa knew best.
“Andrew Scheer has demonstrated that he is no different.”

Mr. Yves Côté
Commissioner of Canada Elections
30 Victoria Street
Gatineau, Quebec
K1A 0M6
Dear Mr. Côté:
I write to draw your attention to a number of examples of partisan activities carried out by the Canadian Shooting Sports Association (CSSA) that appear to be in breach of the Elections Canada rules for third parties. I trust you will examine these possible violations of the new third party provisions contained in the Canada Elections Act (S.C. 2000, c.9).
On September 20, 2019, our Party’s leader, Mr. Justin Trudeau, announced that a re-elected Liberal government will take serious, common-sense action to strengthen gun control and crack down on gun crime. Specifically, if re-elected, we will ban all military-style assault rifles and also work with municipalities to give them the ability to further restrict or ban handguns. We will work with law enforcement to strengthen safe-storage laws and limit the glorification of violence by creating new rules on where and how guns are advertised, marketed, and sold in Canada.
We will continue to respect Canadian hunters, farmers, and sport shooters. We will not bring back the long-gun registry. Hunters neither use nor need assault weapons.
In response to this announcement, the CSSA disseminated a newsletter on September 23, 2019 that states: “With the 2019 federal election looming, the CSSA is putting its members’ money where its mouth is. We commissioned a series of videos in English and Mandarin with a simple message: if you use or own guns, you must vote in Election 2019.” The CSSA also encourages members to oppose their local Liberal candidate in the election.
Further to that, the CSSA states that its video commercials are “already running on Citytv and the Wild TV networks.”
As of September 25, 2019, the CSSA is not listed on the Elections Canada website as a registered third party for the purposes of the 43rd General Election, despite having apparently incurred more than $500 in regulated expenses. Additionally, the videos posted online, which the organization states are airing on television, do not bear the requisite authorization tag for election advertisements. This raises concerns with respect to the transparency of the third party advertiser.
I trust you will review the attached materials and consider our serious concerns from a compliance standpoint.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Yours sincerely,

Adam Vaughan
Liberal candidate for Spadina-Fort York

Fredericton, NB — A re-elected Liberal government will increase Old Age Security by an extra ten per cent once a senior turns 75, and will boost the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit by 25 per cent.
Canadians are living longer than ever before, but as they age they face higher health care costs, and they’re worried about their savings running out. The number of seniors who rely on Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) payments — a monthly benefit that goes to the poorest seniors — goes up with age. Today, as many as 238,000 seniors live in poverty.
“Over the last four years, we’ve expanded benefits for older Canadians — helping lift 50,000 seniors out of poverty,” said Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “But we know many seniors still struggle to keep up with their bills as they age. After a lifetime of hard work, people should have peace of mind knowing their retirement savings won’t run out, and that their government will be there to help.”
A re-elected Liberal government will take meaningful action — working in partnership with provinces and territories — to further strengthen the supports that our seniors rely on every day:

We will put up to $729 more in the pockets of seniors each year, by increasing Old Age Security (OAS) by ten per cent once they turn 75. This will help lift more than 20,000 seniors out of poverty, of whom two-thirds will be women; and
We will give up to $2,080 in additional benefits, every year, to those who’ve lost a loved one, by increasing the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) survivor’s benefit by 25 per cent.

Since 2015, we have taken real action to help more Canadians retire with confidence, including:

Restoring the eligibility age for OAS and GIS benefits to 65 from 67;
Making the most significant enhancement to the CPP since its creation — which will raise the maximum CPP benefit by up to 50 per cent once fully rolled-out;
Giving single seniors nearly $1,000 more a year to help pay the bills, through our boost to the GIS top-up; and
Increasing the GIS earnings exemption, so that low-income seniors who choose to keep working can keep more of their hard-earned income.

“Andrew Scheer voted against lowering the OAS eligibility age from 67 to 65, which boosts seniors’ retirement savings by thousands of dollars and lets them retire earlier, so they can spend more time with their grandkids,” said Mr. Trudeau. “His party also pledged to reverse the changes we made to strengthen the CPP. Seniors deserve more from their government, and if re-elected, we will continue to work to make sure they have a safe, secure, and dignified retirement.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Yom Kippur:
“Today at sunset, Jewish communities in Canada and around the world will come together to observe the start of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. A time of reflection, introspection, and repentance, this holiday will bring family and friends together tonight to fast and pray.
For all of us, Yom Kippur is a chance to honour the Jewish Canadian community, and to celebrate the important contributions of our neighbours and friends. In years to come, just like in years past, this community will continue creating a better Canada for everyone.
For many Jewish Canadians, Yom Kippur comes during a difficult year. In the wake of violent acts of hatred in Canada and beyond, this is a time to recommit to fighting antisemitism, hatred, and discrimination in every form. These acts have no place in our country or our world, and we must always stand united against them. Together, we can continue to build a more inclusive Canada where we celebrate the diversity that is our strength.
On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone observing Yom Kippur a Gmar Chatima Tova.”

Ottawa, ON – In response to Andrew Scheer’s fake climate plan, Catherine McKenna, Liberal M.P. for Ottawa Centre, released the following statement:
“It has been 416 days since Andrew Scheer promised a climate plan. There is a reason he waited until the last hours of this Parliament. He wanted nobody around to debate ideas that will cost Canadians more while doing less to protect our environment and the future for our kids.
“The Conservatives are ignoring the smartest companies and leading economists who tell us fighting climate change is a recipe for global stability and economic success. Extreme weather events are increasing in severity and costs are spiraling. All the while, Conservative politicians like Jason Kenney and Doug Ford make cuts to flood and wildfire management programs and do less to fight pollution.
“Canadians want an ambitious and sensible climate plan that keeps a healthy economy growing while tackling emissions at home and with partners around the world. Not a return to the failed policies of the past, written by fringe oil lobbyists who want to have unlimited pipelines and to gut environmental protections and shut down public input. Unfortunately, that is what the Conservatives want Canadians to accept.”

Montréal, QC – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new TV ad to highlight that a re-elected Liberal government will continue to advance gender equality and promote women’s rights.
“As women, we have a lot to be proud of, in a country where we embrace our differences, and where we’ve protected a woman’s right to choose. And when we’re proud, we choose forward,” said Mélanie Joly, Liberal candidate for Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Valérie Renaud-Martin, Liberal candidate for Trois-Rivières, and Chantal Pilon, Liberal candidate for Rimouski-Neigette-Témiscouata-Les Basques in the new ad.
Last week, we announced important measures that a re-elected Liberal government will take to support women, including creating hundreds of thousands of new before and after school care spaces, nearly doubling federal spending on child care, and moving forward to deliver Guaranteed Paid Family Leave for every new parent in Canada. Because child care still falls disproportionately to women, these measures represent an important step forward for gender equality and will make a difference for families across Canada.
“Our Liberal government has put gender equality at the heart of our work since day one. And whether it’s here at home or beyond our borders, we’ve made important progress,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “But there’s so much more to do – and we’re going to keep working together to build a more equal Canada and a better world.”
Over the last four years, the Liberal government took historic steps to advance the rights of women, girls, and people of all gender identities.

We passed unprecedented pay equity legislation;
We took action to promote women’s leadership on boards and in the C-suite;
We boosted support for women entrepreneurs with a plan to double the number of women entrepreneurs by 2025;
We created the first ever federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence;
We created more than 7,000 shelter spaces for survivors of family violence through our National Housing Strategy;
We launched Canada’s first Feminist International Assistance Policy;
We announced an unprecedented investment to protect the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls everywhere, including universal access to family planning, contraception, comprehensive sexuality education, and access to safe and legal abortion and post-abortion care; and
We passed legislation that added gender identity and expression as a protected ground in the Canada Human Rights Act.

“Whether it’s health care or support for survivors of sexual assault, the Conservatives want to slash access to vital services and roll back the clock on women’s rights,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We can’t take the progress we’ve made for granted. We have to stand united, work together, and choose forward on gender equality.”

Victoria, BC – A re-elected Liberal government will help Canadians buy their first home.
For many young people starting their careers, saving up enough to make a down payment on a home is a far-off dream at best – and for ten years, Stephen Harper’s Conservatives did nothing to address these systemic problems. In the greater Toronto, Vancouver, and Victoria regions, people are facing these challenges head on, with housing prices up to sixty per cent higher than the national average.
“Many young Canadians dream of owning their first home. But with rising prices – and not enough homes to meet the demand – it’s getting harder and harder to make that dream a reality,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “Again and again, the Liberal government has stepped up to solve these challenges. Today, we’re announcing another important step to help Canadians buy their first home.”
In recent years, housing speculation by foreign owners has become a major challenge, driving up housing prices for people across the country. Canada is no place for those who wish to purely speculate in the housing market, and we need a national approach to protect families who are being priced out of buying a first home.
A re-elected Liberal government will:

fully implement the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, which provides Canadians with up to ten per cent off the purchase price of their first home;
immediately expand the Incentive to provide more help to communities in the greater Toronto, Vancouver, and Victoria regions by allowing homes valued at up to $789K to qualify;
address the impact of foreign speculation, which drives up housing costs, by putting in place a consistent national speculation and vacancy tax for non-resident, non-Canadians.

In addition to introducing the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, our Liberal government also:

launched Canada’s first-ever National Housing Strategy, a ten-year plan that will help more than 600,000 Canadians find safe and affordable places to live;
funded the construction of nearly 140,000 more housing units to be built by 2028; and
created the new Canada Housing Benefit to help 300,000 Canadians with the high costs of rent.

“The Conservatives voted against the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive and have no plan to help address the real concerns Canadians have about being able to own their own home,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Liberals believe in investing in people and in communities, which is why we are taking these steps to make homeownership an achievable dream, not just a privilege for the richest few.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day of the Girl:
“Girls are taking this world by storm. They’re climate leaders. Voices for justice. Entrepreneurs transforming our communities. Artists telling our stories.
On International Day of the Girl, we celebrate girls and young women everywhere. And we come together to promote girls’ rights, and break down the barriers that still hold girls back. Around the globe, girls are leading that charge – fighting for what they believe in, making their voices heard.
Over the last four years, our Liberal government has made major strides to support girls everywhere, and that’s what we’ll continue to do. Under our G7 presidency, we worked with partners to announce a historic investment of $3.8 billion in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations – the largest of its kind ever made. This past summer, we announced another unprecedented investment – this time, to defend the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls globally. And a few weeks ago, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will commit at least ten per cent of our international assistance to education, and lead global efforts to make sure kids growing up in refugee or displacement camps get the education they need and deserve.
We’re working just as hard to support girls and young women growing up in Canada. We will make it easier for young women to pay for post-secondary education by increasing Canada Student Grants by 40 per cent, and by giving students a full two years after graduating before they need to start paying off their student loans – interest free. We’ve worked to eliminate the gender gap in the workforce, from creating pay equity legislation, to launching the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, to helping more women start a career in the trades. We’ve made it a top priority to end violence against women and girls, through the Strategy to Prevent and End Gender-Based Violence and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. We’ve all got to be allies to girls, because building a better world starts there.
To girls in Canada and around the world: there are going to be people out there who try to stand in your way. And that is simply because they’re afraid of your power – power you show us every day when you challenge us to do better. But there will always be more of us who are here to stand with you and help you create the future you want to see. So don’t hold back, and don’t let anyone stop you. You can do anything you set your mind to. Chase down your dreams, because this is your world.
Girls are the future, and the future starts today.”

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new series of ads that highlight how a re-elected Liberal government will continue to make life more affordable for Canadians, protect our environment, and keep our communities safe.
“Andrew Scheer wants you to think this election is about me. I think it’s about you,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, in one of the ads. “This is your country and your choice.”
As millions of Canadians gather with loved ones around the Thanksgiving dinner table, the choice they face on October 21st could not be more clear. Do we:

Build on a serious climate plan, or leave the problem to our kids and grandkids?
Keep cutting taxes for the middle class, or give tax breaks to big polluters and the wealthiest one percent?
Make gun control laws stronger, or weaker?
Invest in our future, or let the Conservatives cut everything we care about?

A re-elected Liberal government will build on the progress we’ve made and continue to make life more affordable for Canadians. Our plan will help people:

Save nearly $600 a year, per family, thanks to our tax cut that helps the middle class, not the richest one percent;
Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by ten per cent once they turn 75, increasing by more $729 each year;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments if they’re buying their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save on medications their family needs when we implement Universal Pharmacare;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care by ten percent;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and get 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

“Let’s do what Canadians always do,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Pull together and move forward.”

Ottawa, ON – If the Conservatives had their way during the NAFTA negotiations, Canada would have backed down.
“In the NAFTA negotiations, our Liberal government fought tooth and nail to protect Canadian jobs. We said we would get a good deal, and that’s exactly what we achieved,” said Chrystia Freeland, Liberal candidate in the Toronto riding of University—Rosedale. “Conservatives urged Canada to fold to America’s demands — no matter the cost to our economy or middle class workers.”
Here’s how the Conservatives would have backed down to the United States:

Stephen Harper – in the fall of 2017, Harper released a memo that publicly said Canada has no leverage and needs to accept American demands. “Canada will be left with no option but to gradually capitulate,” Harper said. He was wrong. Macleans described Harper’s bad negotiating strategy: “What would Harper have the Canadian bargaining position be? In the absence of red lines drawn in public, apparently he would have the Canadian negotiating team tell the Americans, again in public: ‘We have no bottom line.’” (Macleans, Oct 30, 2017)
Andrew Scheer – In August 2018, when the United States told Canada to take-it-or-leave it. We said no and held out for a better deal.But Andrew Scheer and Erin O’Toole panicked. “Canadians are now on the outside,” tweeted Scheer, urging us to join the U.S.-Mexico deal. As we negotiated hard for the next six weeks, Conservatives publicly urged us to submit to the American offer.
Steel & Aluminum – The Conservatives repeatedly urged us to back down to the Americans by dropping retaliatory steel & aluminum tariffs. If we took the Conservative advice, the U.S. tariffs would still be in place. On February 4, 2019, Doug Ford’s Conservatives held a press conference calling on us to unilaterally and unconditionally drop our countermeasures. And taking his cue from Doug Ford, Erin O’Toole tweeted that we should drop our retaliatory measures.

“We stood up to Donald Trump on trade when the Conservatives wanted Canada to back down. The Conservatives told us to take any deal we could get. Capitulation is not a negotiating strategy,” said Freeland.

Hamilton, ON – A re-elected Liberal government will make sure every Canadian has access to a family doctor, to mental health services, to affordable prescription drugs, and to national pharmacare.
Canada’s health care system is a source of pride, but too many people still slip through the cracks. Today, nearly five million Canadians have no access to a family physician or a primary care team. All of us know someone who has gone through a mental health issue – but many people can’t get the help they need because it costs too much or the wait time is too long. And nearly one million Canadians skimp on food and heat to be able to pay for the medications they depend on, from insulin to inhalers.
“No one should go without the care they need because they don’t have access to a family doctor. And no one should have to give up food and heat to be able to pay for health care – whether it’s insulin, inhalers, or mental health support,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We’re going to close the gaps in the health care system, and make sure people can get the care they need, when they need it most.”
A re-elected Liberal government will make sure Canadians can afford and access lifesaving health care.
We will improve people’s access to health care by:

ensuring that every Canadian can easily find a family doctor or primary care team;
setting clear national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get the support they need quickly, when they need it most; and
continuing to make home care and palliative care more available to those who need it.

We will make sure everyone can afford the medications they need by:

implementing Universal Pharmacare, so that all Canadians have the drug coverage they need at an affordable price;
establishing the Canada Drug Agency to make drug purchasing more effective and efficient, and implementing a national formulary with partners to set prices; and
bringing down the cost of lifesaving high-cost drugs for families through the Rare Disease Drug Strategy.

Our government has made some of the most needed, significant changes to Canada’s health care system in decades. Over the past four years, we have:

helped more people access home care and mental health care through new health agreements with all the provinces and territories, allocating $11 billion in new funding;
undertaken the most comprehensive overhaul of drug pricing in thirty years, which will save Canadians approximately $13 billion over the next decade;
invested $500 million a year towards the creation of a rare disease drug strategy; and
taken the first steps to building a national pharmacare system.

“In the future, the federal government will have to negotiate with the provinces and territories, as has always been the case, to reach new health accords,” said Mr. Trudeau. “When that time comes, who do you want at the negotiation table, standing up to Doug Ford? Andrew Scheer, who follows his lead – or our Liberal team, who will fight for you?”

Québec City, QC – As Andrew Scheer launches his campaign in Québec, Pablo Rodriguez and Diane Lebouthilier, Québec Campaign Co-Chairs, issued the following statement:
“Andrew Scheer is launching his campaign today in Trois-Rivières, but Québecers know that Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives, just like those of Stephen Harper, do not share their priorities.
Environment
“Québecers know that urgent action is needed to combat climate change. The Conservatives have delivered a bogus plan that would take Canada backward on its environmental responsibilities by eliminating the price on pollution and doing everything to please oil lobbyists.
Economy
“Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives will make deep cuts to services on which Québecers depend. For our part, we introduced the Canada Child Benefit, which gives more money to 9 out of 10 Canadian families; cut taxes for the middle class while raising taxes on the wealthiest 1% of Canadians; and lowered taxes for small businesses.
Free Trade
“On the NAFTA file, Andrew Scheer advocated for total surrender. His pandering would have meant a dismantling of supply management in the dairy industry, an end to the exemption that protects Québec culture, and the elimination of all possible recourse for the Québec softwood lumber industry against the Americans.
“On the topic of unfair and illegal tariffs on US imports of Canadian aluminum, the Conservatives demanded that we drop our retaliatory measures without any concessions from the Americans. We stood strong for our workers and negotiated an agreement to lift these tariffs.
Local Infrastructure
“We invested more than 70 million dollars to support a high-frequency rail project for the Québec City-Toronto corridor by way of Trois-Rivières. For his part, Andrew Scheer promised to eliminate the infrastructure bank that finances the study of this project.
Culture
“For 10 years, the Scheer and Harper Conservatives made cuts to our culture. They made cuts to Radio-Canada, our official languages, and critical funding for our artists and creators. Québecers remember the war the Conservatives waged against the cultural community.
“In 2015, we promised to repair the damage. Since that time, we have made the largest ever reinvestment in culture.
“On October 21, let’s choose forward. Justin Trudeau’s team will work hard for you and with you.”

Toronto, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released new ads warning Canadians that Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives would cut and paste from the playbook of Stephen Harper — making deep cuts to programs and less help for the people who need it.
“I’ve seen all kinds of governments come and go,” says Lawrence MacAulay, Liberal candidate in the riding of Cardigan, in one of the new ads. “When we elected the Conservatives all they did was cut taxes for the wealthy, and cut services for everyone else.”
Since 2015, a Liberal government has worked hard to undo the harmful changes made by the Conservatives. For example:

After Stephen Harper raised the retirement age to 67, we lowered it back to 65 and increased Old Age Security (OAS) payments;
After Harper closed offices and clawed back benefits for veterans, we re-opened those offices and re-instated lifelong pensions; and
After the Conservatives kept sending child care cheques to millionaires, we created the tax-free and more generous Canada Child Benefit — putting hundreds of dollars back into the pockets of middle class families, and those working hard to join the middle class.

Now, Andrew Scheer’s plan will lower taxes the most for wealthier Canadians. With his approach, a person making $40,000 will get less than a person making $400,000. He also voted against lowering the OAS eligibility age from 67 to 65 — which boosts seniors’ retirement savings by thousands of dollars — and his party pledged to reverse the changes we made to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan.
The Liberal plan, however, builds on the progress we’ve made investing in families, workers, and communities. Under our plan, we will cut taxes for the middle class, without giving a break to millionaires. We will give more help to older Canadians and veterans. And we will continue to take bold action to protect our environment and fight climate change.
“Soon, Canadians will have a choice to make,” said Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “Go back to the Harper years, or keep moving forward with a government that stands by all Canadians.”

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Hon. Navdeep Bains shared a video of Andrew Scheer speaking about his plan to subsidize wealthy private schools with hundreds of millions of federal tax dollars, and highlighted how this plan would take us backward to the failed Conservative policies of the past.
“Great public schools are the bedrock of Canada’s economy,” Bains said. “The Conservatives don’t get that. That’s why they’d weaken public education with a reckless plan to fund private schools and homeschooling, as this video makes clear.”

On Persons Day, we celebrate the anniversary of a landmark victory for women’s rights and a turning point for democracy in Canada. The 1929 ruling opened the door to further progress, lending momentum to future generations who would continue to push for a more equal world.
Persons Day falls during Women’s History Month – a reminder that women have fought for change in the past, and continue to do so today. Advocates are carrying this work forward, and over the last four years, our Liberal government has stood with them. Whether it’s introducing Canada’s first gender-equal Cabinet, helping more women start their own business, combatting gender-based violence, or investing in education for the world’s most vulnerable women and girls, we’ve worked to move the dial on gender equality and build a more just, equal Canada for everyone. And from breaking down barriers in the workforce by offering guaranteed paid family leave, to investing in the organizations that fight for gender equality each day, we will keep putting gender equality at the heart of everything we do.
The Famous Five’s story also teaches us that we have to keep pushing forward – especially when the going gets tough. In 2019, we’ve seen an attack on women’s rights around the world, from the legitimization of gender-based violence, to the assault on a woman’s right to choose. Even in Canada, some politicians are intent on rolling back rights and cutting access to important services like health care and sexual assault centres. We can’t afford to lose ground on gender equality – but Persons Day shows us that if we work together, we can win the hardest battles. Today, let’s come together for a more equal world, and choose forward, for all of us.”

Andrew Scheer
Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada
1720-130 Albert St
Ottawa, ON
K1P 5G4
Dear Mr. Scheer,
Today, Ontario’s Francophones are celebrating more than 400 years of outstanding contributions to the cultural, social, economic and political life of our country.
Unfortunately, this contribution is under threat from the draconian cuts Doug Ford’s government has made to services for the Franco-Ontarian community.
The Liberal Party of Canada is a proud defender of official languages and will continue to stand united with Franco-Ontarians in protecting their linguistic rights. Our record includes, amongst other things:

The Action Plan for Official Languages 2018-2023 which includes a historic $2.7 billion investment;
A $675 million funding increase to the CBC/Radio-Canada;
Reinstatement and modernization of the Court Challenges Program;
Reinstatement of the long-form census;
Nomination of bilingual judges to the Supreme Court of Canada;
Prioritizing francophone immigration to Canada with the launch of a Francophone Immigration Strategy;
Commitment to modernize the Official Languages Act.

We regrettably note you have never had the courage to denounce Doug Ford’s direct attacks on the Franco-Ontarian community. By siding with Doug Ford, you have failed Francophones across the country.
Today, we call on you to once and for all denounce your friend Doug Ford’s deep cuts and that you commit to maintaining the funding we have put into place to support linguistic minorities.
In addition to denouncing Mr. Ford’s cuts, we call on you to explain to Canadians which services you plan to cut in order to balance the budget. Franco-Ontarians have every reason to fear the worst and that you will follow the same approach as Doug Ford: pretend you’re for the people during the election, then once elected, cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everyone else – and in this case, it is services for Francophones that will suffer.

2019 English-language Leaders’ Debate
Last night, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau presented to Canadians his plan to continue investing in our middle class, grow the economy, and protect the environment. And the responses keep pouring in.
Quotations are included in their original language
“The most-passionate version of Trudeau emerged in the night’s final segment, on the environment and energy. There, again, Trudeau invoked the choice he wants voters to see, between Conservatives who would rip up the current plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and Liberals who are pledged to keep going.” – Aaron Wherry, CBC News, October 8, 2019
“Trudeau remained calm through the fast-paced debate, reciting his governing party’s record of investing in programs aimed at fostering prosperity.” – Alan Cochrane, Telegraph Journal, October 8, 2019
“Mr. Trudeau proved willing to fight back and make his Conservative political rival his rhetorical punching bag, forcing him to defend his stance on social issues such as abortion rights.” – Jessica Murphy, BBC News, October 8, 2019
« M. Trudeau a néanmoins réussi à se démarquer de son adversaire conservateur sur les questions sociales. M. Scheer a d’ailleurs prononcé les mots qu’il refusait de dire jeudi dernier, quand il a avancé que « comme des millions de Canadiens » il est « pro-vie ». Si l’objectif du chef libéral était de sortir du débat sans trop de blessures, il peut dire mission accomplie. » – Fanny Olivier, Radio-Canada, 7 octobre, 2019
“[Trudeau] emerged, it appears, unscathed, which for an incumbent is best you could hope for.” – Vassy Kapelos, CBC, October 7, 2019
“But ultimately I have to say probably the biggest winner out of this was the Prime Minister” – Jenni Byrne, CP24, October 7, 2019
“Overall Trudeau was strong; I don’t think anybody knocked him out of the ring.” – Tom Mulcair, News Talk 1010, October 8, 2019
“The loser tonight, sadly, was Mr. Scheer. And I say that because there were great expectations that he would effectively challenge Trudeau and he didn’t effectively challenge him.” – Robin Sears, CP24, October 7, 2019
“And Justin Trudeau for the most part, no gaffes, no mistakes. As steady as she goes for the most part for him tonight.” – Aleem Kanji (VP Government Relations – Sutherland Corporation), CTV News, October 7, 2019
« À plusieurs égards, le chef libéral Justin Trudeau a mieux défendu son bilan des quatre dernières années (…) il a aussi abondamment parlé des principales promesses contenues dans son programme électoral, ce qu’il avait omis de faire la semaine dernière. Il a finalement donné un certain sens à ce que pourrait être un second mandat libéral. » – Joël-Denis Bellavance, La Presse, 8 octobre 2019
“The loser in all this was Andrew Scheer. The Conservative leader needed to have a big night, after a week in which his reputation was pounded by his opponents for the alleged lack of transparency on his resumé, his views on issues of conscience and his nationality (…) If the Tories lose this election, putting a price on carbon is an issue they will have to revisit or risk being left looking like a BlackBerry in an iPhone world.” – John Ivison, National Post, October 8, 2019

Montréal, QC – The Liberal Party of Canada is launching a significant new advertising campaign as the 2019 election approaches, highlighting how Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are the only party that will stand up for middle class families.
Beginning today, new french-language national advertising featuring Justin Trudeau will air in heavy rotation on television across Québec and online across Canada, accompanied by a series of radio ads from Liberal MPs that will begin airing today in every part of Québec. New billboards are also being placed on major routes leading to the new Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge, as a reminder of how Liberals took a stand for middle class families and removed the tolls that the Conservatives had planned for it.
“Since 2015, Justin Trudeau and our Liberal team have stood up for middle class families,” said Pablo Rodriguez, Québec Campaign Co-Chair and M.P. for Honoré-Mercier. “After 10 years of Stephen Harper’s failed policies left the middle class falling behind, we’ve been making real progress – with one million new jobs created, more money for families, and real action to protect our environment. But there’s so much more to do, and we will never stop working hard to build a better future.”
Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team have a real plan to strengthen the middle class, grow the economy, and make life better for Canadian families. By introducing the Canada Child Benefit, lowering taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest 1 percent, putting a national price on pollution, and protecting middle class jobs with the new NAFTA, Justin Trudeau has been taking a stand for Canadians – but there’s so much more to do, and we can’t let the Conservatives take us back to the failed policies of Stephen Harper.
“This fall, Quebecers and all Canadians will have a clear choice to make,” added Diane Lebouthillier, Québec Campaign Co-Chair and M.P. for Gaspésie—Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine. “While Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are focused on investing in the middle class, Andrew Scheer is focused on austerity and cutting vital services, just like Stephen Harper.”
Liberal campaigns across Canada have started 2019 strong, with a new by-election victory in Outremont, continued growth in grassroots fundraising, more than 200 nominated candidates, and the momentum of more than 1.5 million new conversations with Canadians and 1,000 volunteer engagement events over the past year – the party’s largest-ever volunteer mobilization outside of an election.

St. John’s, NL – A re-elected Liberal government will put more money in parents’ pockets to help them in the first year of their children’s lives.
Nothing is more important to parents than spending time with their kids. But raising a family isn’t cheap, and the bills pile up early on – when parents are being paid less but baby products and child care cost more.
“Every parent knows that raising kids is expensive – especially in that first year,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “With everything else on their plates, the last thing new parents need to worry about is making ends meet. That’s why we’ll be there for families – so they can be there for their kids.”
A re-elected Liberal government will:

give up to $1,000 more to families to help when the costs of raising kids are highest, by boosting the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) by 15 per cent for children under the age of one;
make sure families get more money right away, by making maternity and parental benefits tax-free; and
make paid leave fairer for families, by introducing a 15-week leave for adoptive parents – so they get as much in benefits to care for their kids as everyone else.

These important steps will build toward a long-term vision that helps families when it matters most.
That’s why we will, within the first year of our mandate, work to establish Guaranteed Paid Family leave – an ambitious program that will make sure that parents who don’t qualify for paid leave through Employment Insurance or don’t get enough, because they’re between jobs, earn little, or haven’t worked enough hours, will receive a guaranteed income during the first year of their child’s life. This means every single Canadian parent will be able to afford to spend the first year at home with their kid.
Since 2015, our government has made it a priority to make life easier and more affordable for families:

We gave more money to nine out of ten families and helped lift 300,000 children from poverty, by creating the CCB;
We created tens of thousands of new child care spaces across the country, by developing the Early Learning and Child Care framework;
We made parental leave more flexible, by allowing parents to spread their time over 18 months; and
We gave both parents the option to take more time off with their newborn, by adding the five-week parental sharing benefit.

“Conservatives like Andrew Scheer and Doug Ford pretend they are for the people, but on the first opportunity, they cut taxes for the wealthiest and cut the help Canadian families rely on,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Our kids deserve the best possible start in life – and that’s exactly what today is all about.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Small Business Week, which runs from October 20 to 26, 2019:
“On Small Business Week, we celebrate the local business owners and entrepreneurs who make our country such a great place to live.
Small and medium sized businesses grow our economy, create jobs, and help Canada thrive. Behind every small business is an entrepreneur – dedicated Canadians who dream big, work hard, and move our country forward. In the last four years, they’ve helped push unemployment to historic lows and create over a million new jobs for Canadians. From mom & pop shops to small home-based startups to growing mid-sized companies, Canada’s entrepreneurs are the backbone of our economy and our communities.
That’s why our Liberal government has worked hard every day to help our entrepreneurs get ahead. From reducing the small business tax rate to the lowest in the G7, to helping more people start their own business with the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, our Liberal government has made supporting small businesses a top priority. From CETA to the CPTPP, we signed a record number of trade deals, helping our businesses compete in markets around the world. We stood firm during the NAFTA renegotiations, to defend our trade relationship with Canada’s largest trading partner. And when Conservatives wanted to make concessions and settle for less, we fought – and won – to protect Canadian jobs and get a good deal for our workers and the many businesses throughout the supply chain that employ them.
We still have work to do. Today, nearly one in five entrepreneurs say it’s still a challenge to get the financing they need from traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions. To help more Canadians start and grow a business, a re-elected Liberal government will create the Canada Entrepreneur Account, administered through the Business Development Bank of Canada, to provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs with as much as $50,000 each year to launch their new businesses.
To make it easier for our small and medium-sized businesses to succeed, we’ll cut the cost of federal incorporation by 75 per cent, eliminate all fees from certain business advisory services, and eliminate the “swipe fee” on HST and GST for credit transactions – which will save businesses nearly $500 million a year in fees. And to help small businesses reach new customers around the world, we will make sure every Canadian business has access to reliable, high-speed internet by 2030, including in rural, remote, and northern communities.
In the last four years, Canada’s entrepreneurs and business owners have built a strong economy and laid the foundation for a better future. And this progress has been possible because our Liberal government rejected Conservative cuts and austerity – and chose instead to invest in the middle class and people working hard to join it. Tomorrow, Canadians will have a choice to make, and that choice couldn’t be more clear: go backwards with cuts to services and support, or choose forward together for a more prosperous future. Let’s do something small business owners do every day – roll up our sleeves and move forward.”

Gatineau, QC – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new ad highlighting how a re-elected Liberal government will move forward with Quebecers and all Canadians to build a better future.
“We want to move forward,” says one woman featured in the new ad.
“We want a country that protects a woman’s right to choose,” other participants say. “We want a country that puts the environment first, that invests in public transit. A country that helps families and lowers our taxes.”
In less than two weeks, Canadians will make a choice about the future of our country. That choice could not be more clear. Do we:

Protect a woman’s right to choose, or roll back the progress we’ve made on gender equality?
Fight the climate crisis with a serious plan, or leave the problem to our kids and grandkids?
Invest in families, or let the Conservatives cut everything we care about?
Keep cutting taxes for the middle class, or give tax breaks to big polluters and the wealthiest one percent?

A re-elected Liberal government will keep moving forward to make life more affordable for Canadians. Our plan will help people:

Save nearly $600 a year, per family, thanks to our tax cut that helps the middle class, not the richest one percent;
Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by ten per cent once they turn 75, increasing by up to $729 each year;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments if they’re buying their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save on medications their family needs when we implement Universal Pharmacare;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care by ten percent;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and get 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

“Over the last four years, we’ve put Canada on the path of progress. And we’re not stopping now,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, in the ad. “On October 21st, I’m choosing forward – for everyone.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day of Peace:
“Today, on the International Day of Peace, we celebrate global efforts to make peace a reality around the world. We honour the advocates who are on the frontlines of that work, and come together to build a more just, equal, and peaceful future.
This year’s theme, ‘Climate Action for Peace,’ reminds us that there’s no peace without justice – and no justice without climate justice. We’re all connected, and lasting, sustainable peace must include fighting the climate crisis and building more equal, resilient communities around the world.
Canada has a long and proud history as a voice for human rights around the globe, and a leader in international efforts to advance peace. Since 2015, Canada has made major strides to build on that leadership. Canadian peacekeepers have served in UN missions from Mali to Uganda to Haiti, helping communities around the globe build lasting peace and security. In 2017, Canada led the creation of the Vancouver Principles – now endorsed by nearly 100 countries – to end the recruitment and use of child soldiers and protect children around the globe.
When women participate meaningfully in peace processes, they help build more lasting peace. That’s why, together with our UN partners, we launched the Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace Operations, to boost women’s participation in conflict prevention, stabilization, and peacebuilding efforts. And last year, together with our partners, we delivered a historic investment in women and girls’ education in crisis and conflict situations – the largest of its kind ever made.
There’s much more to be done, and all of us have a role to play to build a more just and equal world, and a more peaceful, prosperous future. Together, let’s choose forward, advance peace and justice, and make our world a better one – today, and for generations to come.”

Montréal, QC — A re-elected Liberal government will plant two billion trees, using the power of nature to help fight climate change and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
Canada’s vast forests, grasslands, and wetlands help clean our air, safeguard our water, and provide crucial wildlife habitat. But just as nature is under threat by climate change, it can also be a critical ally in the fight against it. Natural climate solutions like planting trees and protecting grasslands can also help get Canada significantly closer to reaching its emissions-reduction targets.
“Nature isn’t just part of our identity as Canadians. It’s part of the solution to climate change. And it’s a solution we can start using today,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “Trees are a fundamental part of a cleaner future. They’re renewable. They’re sustainable. And, eventually, they recycle themselves. All we have to do is plant the first one.”
A re-elected Liberal government will use the power of nature to fight climate change:

We will launch an ambitious program to plant two billion trees over ten years, as part of a $3 billion effort to deploy natural climate solutions.
This program will also take concrete action to conserve and restore Canada’s forests, grasslands, agricultural lands, wetlands, and coastal areas;
We will support about 3,500 seasonal jobs in tree planting;
We will help cities expand and diversify their urban forests; and
We will protect Canada’s trees from infestations, and help rebuild our forests after a wild-fire.

This builds on a strong Liberal record of protecting the environment, including:

Committing to increase Canada’s land and ocean conservation to 25 per cent by 2025 and 30 per cent by 2030;
Making the largest investment in nature conservation in Canada’s history — $1.35 billion in protecting more land and waters, and supporting species at risk.

“When Doug Ford took an axe to Ontario’s tree planting programs and the seasonal jobs it supported, we took a stand,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We can either go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change — or fight for a better future. I’m for moving forward.”

Burnaby, BC — A re-elected Liberal government will cut taxes in half for companies that produce zero emissions technologies, which will create jobs, grow Canadian businesses, and help us get to net-zero.
In the coming years, the market for clean technology — which uses renewable energy and emits less pollution — is expected to exceed $2.5 trillion by 2022. Canada will lead the way: to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, and to achieve the ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
“It’s time to be a part of the solution,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We have the talent, we have the vision, and we have the reputation of being the best place in the world to start and grow a zero emissions tech business.”
A re-elected Liberal government will make Canada the most attractive place to start — and grow — a business that produces zero emissions technology. We will:

Cut in half corporate taxes for companies that develop technologies or manufacture products that have zero emissions;
The corporate taxes for small cleantech businesses will be cut from 9 per cent to 4.5 per cent, and the larger cleantech companies will see their taxes drop from 15 percent to 7.5 per cent.
Continue to lead by example and ensure all federal buildings run on clean electricity by 2022; and
Leverage the purchasing power of the federal government to further drive clean technology adoption, by strengthening existing green procurement policies.

This builds on a strong Liberal record of encouraging businesses to invest in sustainability and create hundreds and thousands of jobs, including:
Allowing businesses to immediately write-off the full cost of installing clean energy equipment; and
Investing in the first ever completely electric mine, as well as the first zero-emissions aluminum smelter.
“From electric cars to renewable power, we’ve made huge leaps in what’s possible when it comes to protecting our air, our water, and our future,” said Mr. Trudeau. “While Conservatives want to make polluting free again, we’re looking forward — on the next generation of clean technology, built right here by Canadians.”

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new ad highlighting that a re-elected Liberal government will give middle class families an extra $600 every year by lowering taxes, while a Conservative government would give more breaks to millionaires.
“We believe in helping those who need it most: middle class Canadians and people working hard to join them,” says the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, in the new ad. “We’re proposing a tax cut, where a middle class family gets $600 and the wealthiest one per cent get zero.”
Earlier this week, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will make sure middle class Canadians, and the people working to join the middle class, pay no federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn. This will be done by raising the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) by almost $2,000 for people earning under $147,000 a year.
This Liberal middle class tax cut will:

Save the average family nearly $600 a year;
Mean 700,000 people will pay no tax at all — nearly 60 per cent of whom are women;
Lift about 40,000 Canadians out of poverty; and
Benefit only the middle class and those working hard to join it, not the richest one percent.

Andrew Scheer has a plan that will lower taxes the most for wealthier Canadians. With his approach, a person making $40,000 will get less than a person making $400,000.
“Whenever the Conservatives cut taxes, they cut them for the wealthy — and in this election, it’s no different,” continues Mr. Trudeau in the ad. “The Conservative approach would go back to giving tax breaks to millionaires.”
This middle class tax cut is just one way a re-elected Liberal government will make life more affordable, saving Canadian families thousands of dollars each year. An average family in Canada will also:

Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by ten per cent once they turn 75, increasing by more $729 each year;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments if they’re buying their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save on medications their family needs when we implement Universal Pharmacare;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care by ten percent;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and get 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on National Seniors Day:
“On National Seniors Day, we celebrate the people who have made Canada the place we know and love. Parents and grandparents, neighbours and friends – Canada’s seniors built this country, and their hard work and vision continue to lift our communities up. Whether it’s helping neighbours in need, or being there for us in the tough moments, seniors make Canada stronger every day.
Seniors have spent a lifetime helping others, and deserve to enjoy their golden years in comfort and dignity. Over the last four years, our Liberal government took action to make that a reality for seniors across Canada.
After the Harper government announced they would raise the age of eligibility for Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement to 67, we brought it back down to 65. We strengthened the Canada Pension Plan. And for the most vulnerable seniors, we boosted the Guaranteed Income Supplement – because no one, of any age, should have to worry about making ends meet.
We also invested in home care, and created the Canada Caregiver Credit to provide simpler and better support for people taking care of a loved one. And with a new Minister of Seniors, we are making sure the perspectives and needs of older Canadians are front and centre.
We know there is still more to do so that all seniors enjoy the secure retirement they deserve. Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will increase Old Age Security by an extra ten per cent at the age of 75, and will boost the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit by 25 per cent. These changes will help lift thousands of seniors out of poverty, and support people after they have lost a loved one.
Together, let’s choose forward, and keep working to make life better for people of every age, from coast to coast to coast. Today, let’s celebrate the seniors in our lives, and thank them for all that they have done, and all that they continue to do.”

“When it comes making tough decisions and cuts, I do agree that it’s very important. But we also have to be very, very careful how we communicate that to people. We do have to win the next election in 2019 and there are examples when Conservative parties go in and have a very hard-edged tone to it. We can make the case for spending cuts, absolutely.”
(Andrew Scheer, Conservative Leadership Candidate Meeting, Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, September 7, 2016)
“Andrew Scheer is committed to austerity and cuts, and he is purposely downplaying his cuts plan in order to get elected. Scheer said so to Conservatives at a private event,” said Liberal MP Bill Morneau. “Scheer’s plan to downplay his plan for deep cuts won’t work because Canadians know that Conservatives say they’re for the people, then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else.”
“What Andrew Scheer is saying in this video is exactly what Doug Ford did. Ford said one thing during the election, then made cuts to schools, libraries, public health agencies, and francophone services,” said Morneau. “Scheer has promised the same timelines for cuts as Doug Ford did: five years. Scheer just wont talk about it until after the election.”

Toronto (ON) — A re-elected Liberal government will ban assault weapons and strengthen gun control in Canada.
Gun crime in Canada is on the rise. In 2017, there were 2,500 more victims of gun violence than in 2013, and many of these incidents involved intimate partners. Today, Canada has no clear classification for assault rifles — making it legal to buy several military-style weapons.
“Too many people have lost loved ones to gun violence. And too often, the culprit is military-style weapons designed to inflict mass human casualties — guns so dangerous that they have no place in Canada,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Thoughts and prayers aren’t going to cut it. A Liberal government will ban assault weapons in Canada.”
A re-elected Liberal government will build on the important measures we passed in Bill C-71, and continue to take serious, common-sense action to crack down on gun crime:

We will ban all military-style assault rifles, including the AR-15;
We will work with the provinces and territories to give municipalities the ability to further restrict — or ban — handguns; and
We will protect the rights of law-abiding hunters and pledge not to bring back the long-gun registry. Hunters do not use or need assault weapons.

We will also take concrete steps — in partnership with our law enforcement agencies — to strengthen gun control.

We will prevent people suspected of posing a danger to themselves or others — including their partners or kids — from possessing or acquiring new firearms;
We will require that everyone importing ammunition must show proof of a valid firearms license; and
We will make it harder for legal weapons to fall into the hands of criminals, by further strengthening safe-storage laws.

Over the last four years, our government took strong action to reduce gun violence:

We reversed the gun laws introduced by Stephen Harper that made it easier to purchase and transfer a weapon;
We started requiring firearm retailers to conduct more extensive background checks; and
We gave provinces and territories more resources to combat gun and gang violence, by investing nearly $330 million through our comprehensive, national Guns and Gangs Strategy.

“Andrew Scheer’s policy on guns was written by the gun lobby. He has an agenda that will make it easier for criminals to get their hands on assault rifles,” said Mr. Trudeau. “It is shameful. It’s time to end gun violence in Canada.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on World Teachers’ Day:
“On World Teachers’ Day, we recognize the mentors and guides who have helped us become the people we are today.
Everyone remembers the teacher who inspired them to find their passion, or who taught them lifelong values of hard work, perseverance, and integrity.
Being a teacher is about preparing kids to pursue their dreams, and helping them have confidence in their power to make a positive difference. They have an extraordinary impact because they never stop working for their students. That’s why, over the last four years, we have been there for our teachers, with everything from a tax benefit for teachers and early childhood educators, to investing in schools and Indigenous education across the country.
Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will keep moving forward, by creating more before and after school care spaces and making Canada Student Grants more generous.
This year’s theme – Young Teachers: The future of the Profession – reminds us not just of the remarkable teachers here in Canada, but of people around the world who are dedicated to giving their students the best possible start in life. Since 2015, Canada has been a leader in supporting education around the globe. At the G7 Leaders’ Summit, we mobilized a historic investment of almost $3.8 billion in education for women and girls in crisis and conflict situations. To build on this progress, we later welcomed an additional $527 million to help developing countries give every child access to quality education and modern skills training.
A re-elected Liberal government will continue this work, from spending no less than ten per cent of our international development assistance budget on education, to leading an international campaign to ensure all children living in refugee or displacement camps get a good education.
I am incredibly proud to have been a teacher, and to have worked alongside the people who go above and beyond to help every young person succeed. Today, let’s celebrate the teachers who change their students’ lives for the better, and create a brighter tomorrow for everyone.”

The Liberal Party of Canada has also committed to the strongest standards in federal politics for openness and transparency with political fundraising events, and is challenging other parties to do the same.

2019 English-language Leaders Debate
Tonight, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau presented to Canadians his plan to continue investing in our middle class, grow the economy, and protect the environment. Here is what some people are saying about tonight’s debate:
Quotations are included in their original language
HOST: T“So let’s talk, very quickly, who won this debate? Who impressed you the most?” TOM MULCAIR: “I think that clearly Justin Trudeau, once again, because nobody was able to score a knockout, comes ahead on points.” – Tom Mulcair, CTV News, 7 October, 2019”
“Trudeau has managed to avoid becoming the centre of attacks tonight which is very interesting.” – Mercedes Stephenson (Global), Twitter, 7 October 2019
“@JustinTrudeau gets to outline some of his biggest accomplishments on bringing 900 000 people out of poverty and creates over a million jobs.” – Evan Solomon (CTV), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Trudeau coming out strong. On Bernier: “You say publicly what Scheer thinks privately.” Say what you will about Trudeau but he just accurately described the right in this country in one sentence.” – Samantha Emann (Hamilton Spectator), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Trudeau réussit à lancer une barbe à Scheer en parlant à Bernier: Vous dites tout haut ce que M. Scheer dit tout bas.” – Christopher G. Nardi (Journal de Montréal), Twitter, 7 octobre, 2019
« J’ai eu l’impression que [Trudeau] était plus précis dans ses réponses aussi. On avait plus de détails sur ses intentions et son bilan. » – Geneviève Tellier (professeure, Université d’Ottawa), RDI, 7 octobre 2019
“Trudeau makes a good point here, Singh still not addressing Bill 21.” – Ben o’Hara-Byrne, CHEK TV, Twitter, October 7, 2019
« Trudeau répond que comme premier ministre, il faut défendre les emplois. Il attaque Scheer en disant qu’il n’a pas déposé de plateforme et qu’il veut faire des compressions comme Doug Ford. » – Philippe-Vincent Foisy (Radio-Canada), Twitter, 7 octobre, 2019
« Blanchet qui utilise le segment sur les affaires autochtones pour parler juste du Québec. Pas fort. On en a aussi au Québec, des Premières nations. » – Mathieu Charlebois (L’Actualité), Twitter, 2 octobre, 2019
“Bernier asks if Scheer thinks he could impose [a] pipeline through Quebec, even if the province doesn’t want it. Bernier says he would impose it, and Scheer doesn’t have the courage to say that too.” – Alex Ballingall (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Shameless of Scheer to call PM “phony” and a “fraud” when he kept his dual passport a secret until forced to acknowledge.” – Damien Cox (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Scheer says that he would pay for his tax cuts and credits by cutting foreign aid and ending (some) corporate welfare. That’s misleading. Those two savings equal ~$3 billion a year. Scheer’s proposed income tax cut alone costs ~$6 billion a year.” – Alex Boutilier (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Claim: Trudeau says “We eliminated 87 long-term boil-water advisories in Indigenous communities and are on schedule to lift all that remain.” Verdict: True (to date). There were 105 long-term boil-water advisories on reserves when Trudeau took office. According to Indigenous Services Canada, as of Sept. 3, 2019, 87 have been eliminated. Budget 2019 provided $739 million over five years, and said it was on track to eliminate all by 2019.” – Hadyn Watters, CBC, October 7, 2019
“#AndrewScheer looks angry (…) it looks bad.” – Michael Coren, Journalist, Twitter, October 7, 2019
« Vérif: la pauvreté a bel et bien reculé chez les enfants canadiens, et la prestation libérale a aidé selon l’économiste Pierre Fortin. » – Paul Journet (La Presse), Twitter, 7 octobre, 2019
“Climate has brought out the most passionate version of Trudeau and is driving his clearest line of the night: that it’s between him and Scheer. That’s where the Liberals are putting their chips.” – Aaron Wherry (CBC), Twitter, October 7, 2019

Toronto, ON — Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new set of ads reminding Canadians that when the Conservatives were last in office, they made life harder for seniors and older Canadians looking forward to retirement.
When Stephen Harper’s Conservatives raised the age of retirement, it took thousands of dollars away from seniors — forcing them to work longer, and preventing them from spending time with their families. Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are the same. He voted against lowering the age of retirement back to 65, and his party pledged to reverse the changes we made to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan.
“Whenever the Conservatives cut taxes, they cut them for the wealthy — and in this election, it’s no different,” says Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, in one of the new ads. “I just don’t think that’s right. I’m for moving forward, for everyone.”
To help older Canadians save more money and retire with confidence, the Liberals have:

Lowered the retirement age back to 65;
Made the most significant enhancement to the Canada Pension Plan since its creation;
Increased Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement;
Lifted 50,000 seniors out of poverty;
Promised to lift another 20,000 seniors out of poverty by increasing Old Age Security again when seniors turn 75; and
Promised to give up to $2,080 in additional benefits, every year, to those who’ve lost a loved one by increasing survivor’s benefits.

Along with giving more support to seniors, a re-elected Liberal government will also lower taxes for the middle class and make life more affordable for those who need a break — not for the wealthiest one per cent.
“The Conservative approach gives tax breaks to millionaires,” continues Mr. Trudeau in one of the ads. “We believe in helping those who need it most: middle class Canadians and those working hard to join them.”

Waterloo, ON – A re-elected Liberal government will help up to 250,000 more public school kids get a spot in before and after-school programs and nearly double federal spending on child care.
Kids across Canada are heading back to school this month. But for many families with elementary school children, finding a spot in before and after school care programs will be difficult and expensive. In 2019, less than one in three elementary school kids will be able to get a space — and in Ontario, for families lucky enough to get a spot, it will cost them more than $4,000 this year. Meanwhile, parents who work late shifts or irregular hours have even fewer child care options. Since child care still falls disproportionately to women, moms are too often left to shoulder the responsibility.
“Parents shouldn’t have to worry about finding quality child care that won’t break the bank. But for too many families, getting their kids the care they need is challenging and expensive. That’s unacceptable,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Today, we’re investing to create hundreds of thousands of new before and after school spaces and lower the costs of child care for families.”
A re-elected Liberal government will help parents with elementary school kids by doing the following:

We will create up to 250,000 more before and after school spaces for kids under the age of ten;
We will put $800 back into the pockets of the average Ontario family of four — every year — by lowering parents’ fees by ten percent across the country. More than one million families will benefit;
We will dedicate a portion of the new spaces to provide more child care options for parents who work overtime, late shifts, or multiple jobs so they can count on help when they need it most.

We will do this by nearly doubling the federal support we provide to the provinces and territories through the Early Learning and Child Care Framework, investing at least $535 million more each year.
These measures build on four years of Liberal investments in child care and families, including:

the Canada Child Benefit, which — in addition to investments in child care — is putting more money in the pockets of nine out of ten families to help with the high cost of raising kids. Since 2015, the CCB has helped lift more than 300,000 Canadian kids out of poverty;
the Early Learning and Child Care Framework, which invested $7.5 billion dollars to create tens of thousands of new child care spaces around the country; and
a commitment to develop an additional 40,000 high quality and affordable learning spaces each year, rising to 100,000 by 2030.

“Just like Stephen Harper, Andrew Scheer’s idea of helping families is to give tax cuts to those who attend private schools,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Canadian families need high quality, affordable child care solutions, not tax breaks for the wealthy at everyone else’s expense. Liberals have a real plan to make smart investments now, so that families can get the care they need for their kids, and help them get the best start possible in life.”
