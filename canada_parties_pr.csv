Scheer to restore order, fairness, and compassion to Canada’s immigration system
A new Conservative government will restore
public confidence in Canada’s immigration system by stopping the flow of
illegal border crossers from the United States and prioritizing newcomers from
the world’s most dangerous countries, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said.
“Canadians’ confidence in the immigration system has been
rocked by Justin Trudeau’s chaos and mismanagement,” Scheer said. “When
everybody follows the rules and the laws are enforced, immigration is good for
the economy, good for jobs, and good for the people who have chosen to come to
Canada.
As Prime Minister, I will take steps to restore confidence
in the system and make sure Canada’s immigration system prioritizes those who
need Canada’s help the most.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Prioritize funding to support immigration services like language training, credential recognition, as      well as services specifically designed for vulnerable newcomers like women, girls, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.Prioritize those who apply to come to Canada through the appropriate immigration streams, especially in the family reunification program.Close the loophole in the Safe Third Country Agreement.Move existing Immigration and Refugee Board judges to common illegal border crossing points, speeding up the process and therefore making it less attractive to enter Canada illegally.Hire an additional 250 CBSA enforcement officers.Listen carefully to provinces on immigration issues, with an aim to work closely to best accommodate their needs and priorities. A Conservative government would be ready to negotiate with the Government of Quebec to discuss the selection of those who wish to settle in Quebec.  We will be open to requests to amend the Canada-Quebec Accord on Immigration.
“These measures will restore fairness and compassion to
our immigration system while providing stronger enforcement of the law at the
border,” said Scheer. “If these measures aren’t taken, confidence in
immigration will continue to slide and legitimate refugees will wait longer and
longer for Canada’s help.”
FACTS:
In 2017, Justin Trudeau created an illegal border crossing crisis in Canada with his #WelcomeToCanada tweet, resulting in more than 50,000 illegal border crossers entering Canada and      costing taxpayers $1.6 billion.A poll in August 2018 found that 65% of Canadians believed the massive influx of illegal border crossers      was a “crisis.”Justin Trudeau has compensated Roxham Road residents $400,000 of taxpayer money for “disruptions” from those crossing the border illegally.Canada is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law, and fundamental and universal human rights, and these values must be reflected in our immigration system.Only a Conservative government will restore compassion and fairness to Canada’s immigration system while protecting and securing our borders.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your      family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax      Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income      Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50%, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians      for green home improvements.

Ottawa,
Ontario – Yesterday, as part of the Liberal platform, Justin Trudeau announced
an expansion of the Child Disability Tax Credit. 
But
the last time Justin Trudeau needed money for his out-of-control deficit
spending he targeted Canadians living with disabilities to pay the bill.
In
2016 Justin Trudeau ordered the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to crack down on
“tax cheats”. As a result, the CRA started clawing back disability benefits –
cutting off diabetics, children with Autism, and a number of other Canadians
living with chronic conditions. 
The result was endless hardship for Canadians
living with disabilities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“As Jewish communities in Canada and around the world prepare to mark Rosh Hashanah and the beginning of the High Holy Days, tonight’s sunset brings with it the Jewish New Year. 

“Rosh Hashanah is celebrated on the first two days of the month of Tishrei and commemorates the day the universe was created by God. Following the sounding of the shofar – the ram’s horn – Jewish community members will recite blessings and light candles.  

“As friends and families share meals with sweet challah and apple slices dipped in honey, they will reflect on renewal, and hope for an abundant year ahead. 

“Canada has truly been blessed by the strong presence of the Canadian Jewish community which continue to add to our country’s culture and values of pluralism and freedom. This Rosh Hashanah, we recommit ourselves to combat all forms of antisemitism and to work together to better our country.

“On behalf of the Canada’s Conservatives, I extend my best wishes to the Jewish community, across Canada and around the world, celebrating Rosh Hashanah.

Families will start saving hundreds of dollars per year for coldest winter months
As part of its 100 Day Action Plan, a new
Conservative government will repeal Justin Trudeau’s carbon tax as its first
piece of legislation, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said today. 
Scheer has already announced that he will convene
Parliament, at which time he will introduce and pass the Carbon
Tax Repeal Act so Canadians aren’t stuck paying a carbon tax over
another long, cold winter.
“Canadians cannot afford to be punished every time they
drive their kids to school or turn up their thermostat on a cold winter day,”
Scheer said. “That’s why a new Conservative government will make sure Trudeau’s
carbon tax is history by January 1 and we will use every legislative tool at
our disposal to get it done.”
Trudeau’s Environment Minister Catherine McKenna has
already confirmed that the carbon tax will go up if the Liberals are
re-elected, but hasn’t said by how much. With Trudeau and the NDP now scheming
to form a coalition government, Scheer said the carbon tax will go through the
roof.
“A government with Trudeau as the spokesman and the NDP
calling the shots would be the worst possible outcome for Canadians,” Scheer
said. “Part of the NDP’s price to keep Trudeau in power will be a massive
increase to the carbon tax. It’s the coalition Canadians can’t afford.”
Scheer also highlighted another part of his 100 Day Action
Plan: removing the GST from Canadians’ home heating bills.
“In Canada, heating your home is not a luxury, it’s a
necessity,” Scheer said.  “Rising home energy costs are a particular
burden on low and middle class families. Justin Trudeau believes we should tax
these families for the privilege of heating their homes. I disagree. I will
take the GST off home heating in my first 100 days as Prime Minister.”
Scheer highlighted how families in Ontario will save as a
result of these measures.  Repealing the Trudeau Carbon Tax will save the
average Ontario family $244 per year, while
removing the GST on home energy costs will save them
$114 more.  
ANDREW SCHEER’S FIRST 100 DAY ACTION PLAN
Introduce
‘Get Ahead Fiscal Update’ within 45 of days of taking office.Implement
Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, Children’s Fitness Tax Credit,Children’s
Arts and Learning Tax Credit and Green Public Transit Tax Credit by January 1,

Trudeau’s plan means less coverage and higher prices for you
Justin Trudeau today left the door wide open to
banning employer drug coverage if he’s re-elected on October 21.
When asked by journalists if his pharmacare
plan would replace current employee drug plans with a government-imposed plan,
Trudeau refused to answer. 
In fact, the report Trudeau based this
announcement on recommended an end to employee drug benefits. 
Today’s announcement is a desperate attempt by
Justin Trudeau to distract from his scandals. 
Trudeau’s Liberals promised pharmacare in 1997
and 2004. They broke their promise then and Justin Trudeau will do it again.
Trudeau cannot be trusted and he is not as advertised.
The proof that he plans to break his promise is
found in the fact that Trudeau is only offering a fraction of the funding
needed to achieve universal pharmacare coverage.  
To pay for his massive deficits, Justin Trudeau
will cut health care funding or raise taxes on middle-class families. Liberal
cuts are exactly what happened in the 1990s, cuts Trudeau said he supported. 
Only Andrew Scheer and the Conservative Party
can be trusted to maintain and increase health care spending by 3% per year.
Under a new Conservative government, Canadians will be able to count on stable
and predictable health and social program funding.

A new Conservative government would engage new strategies, partnerships
and provide funding to support critical industry
Alfie MacLeod, Conservative Candidate for Cape Breton
– Canso, and Eddie Orrell, Conservative Candidate for Sydney – Victoria, were
in Glace Bay today to speak with local fish harvesters about Andrew Scheer’s
plan to promote and support Canada’s fisheries by adopting new strategies and
partnerships to strengthen relationships and build consensus on how to restore
fish stocks. Similar announcements were made by Conservative candidates across
the country.
“The Trudeau Liberals have failed to consult fish
harvesters over the past four years and this has had a real impact on our
coastal communities,” said Alfie MacLeod. “Livelihoods throughout our
province depend on the fishery. 
Conservatives will work with Nova Scotians to strengthen this vital
resource.”
To renew engagement and consultation to support our
fisheries, a new Conservative government will:
Create advisory panels with fish harvesters and anglers, Indigenous groups, and other experts
as appropriate, to rebuild critical stocks and ensure that everyone is working
together. Enhance and rebuild wild Atlantic and Pacific salmon stocks by increasing support for community-led conservation and enhancement
projects and increasing the price of the Salmon Conservation Stamp for
non-residents to benefit the Pacific Salmon Foundation.Complete new recovery
plans for all of Canada’s critical fisheries and develop strategies for managing
predators and invasive species where necessary.Repeal measures that
bypass community consultations for Marine Protected Areas while ensuring that the process is robust and timely. Justin Trudeau’s changes have short
circuited important community consultations for Marine Protected Areas. Work with industry to
develop a strategy for preventing seafood fraud.Create a modern
aquaculture act.Support the advancement
of technology and practices that reduce contact between wild and farmed salmon.
“It is so important to note the important role that
fisheries play in our local economies,” said Alfie MacLeod. “To maintain
infrastructure and support communities, a new Conservative government will provide $250 million in additional support for small craft harbours.”
Supporting our fisheries is also an important part of A
Real Plan to Protect Our Environment. As part of our
efforts to combat oceans plastic, a new Conservative government will work with
international partners to reduce the prevalence of “ghost gear”, or abandoned
and lost gear, which entangles marine wildlife and contributes to the world’s
oceans’ plastic problem. We will work to protect our oceans against one of the
deadliest forms of marine litter.
“A new Conservative government will support our fishing
industry to ensure our local communities and economies continue to thrive,”
said Eddie Orrell. “These are necessary measures – strategies, partnerships,
and funding – to make sure this critical industry continues to thrive.”
Andrew
Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives: “Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.
This election, Canadians have a choice. Between the poor judgement of Justin
Trudeau, and a new, positive Conservative government that will take immediate
action to give you more help at home.”

Conservatives plan to increase health care transfers to the provinces by at least 3% per year
When it comes to improving Canada’s health

Under a Conservative government, funding for health care
will increase by at least 3% every single year, and we will maintain additional

We will make major investments in new medical equipment

to the treatments that they need.
Unfortunately Canadians cannot trust Justin Trudeau. The
media have already reported that Justin Trudeau’s health care promises won’t fill the

deficits will force him to cut health care spending. In fact, in the 1990s,

spending by nearly 40%, cuts Trudeau said he

New transnational project to generate economic and social benefits across the country
A new Conservative government will create a national corridor to carry Canadian energy and resources from coast to coast, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“It’s time for a government that understands we’re in this together,
that Canada works better when we work together,” Scheer said. “A new National
Energy Corridor will create jobs and opportunities while uniting Canadians in
our shared potential and prosperity.” 
A National Energy Corridor will generate
economic and social benefits for the entire country by moving oil, gas,
hydroelectricity, telecommunications, and potentially accommodating other
linear infrastructure. With a single corridor, industry wouldn’t need to submit
complicated proposals for every new project.
A single coast-to-coast corridor would:
minimize environmental impactslower the costs of environmental assessments without sacrificing qualityincrease certainty for investorsget critical projects builtand create good-paying jobs. 
A new Conservative government will appoint a
blue-ribbon task force to provide recommendations within six months of its
establishment on how to proceed. The government would then begin to work with the
provinces and Indigenous peoples – who would both share in the prosperity this
project would provide – to realize this vital coast-to-coast link. 
“As
Canadians, we need to start dreaming big again, and we need to start dreaming
together,” said Scheer. “We need to start building a stronger, more united
country worthy of those who came before us and that our children and

New conservative government to extend EI parental leave to parents in mourning
A new Conservative government will ensure
that EI parental leave is extended for eight weeks following the death of a
baby, affording parents experiencing unimaginable tragedy a much-needed
opportunity to begin coping with their loss.
“With this policy, we hope to give grieving parents some
much-needed support during a time of unimaginable loss,” said Blake Richards,
Conservative Candidate for Banff-Airdrie. “The government can, and must, do
more to support Canadians undergoing such trying times.”
The loss of a child is a situation no parents should ever
have to face. Unfortunately, so many Canadians across the country are put in
this terrible situation and parents are sometimes forced to return to work with
no opportunity to begin to address the profound and recent tragedy that
confronts them.
Currently, EI parental benefits end abruptly the week
following the loss of a child, which comes as a shock to many. A parent’s
sadness should not be compounded by financial worry, and these parents should
not have to worry about their bottom line. Extending EI parental benefits is
the least a government can do.
“There is nothing that can prepare a parent for this experience. We hope that by offering more time, parents will have the important opportunity to cope, to seek help, and to be comforted by those around then,” said Richards. “My deepest sympathies go out to parents who have struggled with the loss of a child. I am proud that a new Conservative government will do more to provide support and relief to Canadians experiencing such difficult times in their lives.”
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives – “The death of a child, at any age is a painful experience – and the loss of a child is followed by the most intense grief. By extending EI benefits to grieving parents, a Conservative government will provide some relief to mourning parents.”

New Military Covenant will clear backlog for Veterans’ benefits within 24 months
Canadian Veterans struggling with months-long waits
for pensions and benefits can count on a new Conservative government to take
immediate action to get them the support they deserve.
Andrew Scheer, leader of Canada’s Conservatives,
announced a comprehensive plan today to deliver more help to Canada’s Veterans
in a timely and respectful manner.
“To every Veteran who has struggled and who
continues to struggle without the support and benefits you have earned through
your service, my message is this: You deserve better. After October 21, we are
going to make things better,” Scheer said. “Instead of forcing Veterans to work
harder for government benefits, it’s time the government worked harder for our Veterans’
benefit. It’s time for a government that works harder for you; it’s time for
you to get ahead.”
Scheer highlighted that a new Conservative
government will:
Enshrine, in legislation, a Military Covenant between the Government of
Canada and all Canada’s Veterans. This will guarantee that every Veteran is
treated with respect and is provided services in a timely manner.Clear the current backlog of Veterans’ benefit applications within 24
months.Create a reliable, dependable pension system that, unlike the Liberal
status quo, is fair to Canada’s most disabled Veterans.Strengthen transition services to support discharged or retired Canadian
Armed Forces members.Strike an independent inquiry to provide answers about Canadian Armed
Forces members who were administered mefloquine.Provide more service dogs to Canadian Veterans in their communities.Put vital
commemoration projects, like the National Memorial for Canada’s War in
Afghanistan, back on track.
“These actions are simple, straightforward, and
practical,” said Scheer. “They require new investment from a new government, but
even more importantly, they require new priorities.  Our military heroes are deserving. Our
military heroes are worth it.”
In 2015, Justin Trudeau promised that no Veteran
would have to “fight the government for the support and compensation they have
earned.”  Yet under the Trudeau Liberals
the number of Veterans left stranded on government waitlists had ballooned to
40,000 – a growth of over 33 per cent. Worst of all, Trudeau continues to fight
Veterans in court, and has dismissed their concerns saying, “They’re asking for
more than we are able to give.”
“Justin Trudeau never turned back SNC-Lavalin’s
lobbyists or claimed they were ‘asking for more than he was able give’,” said Scheer.
“When corporate lobbyists get the red carpet while Veterans get left out in the
cold, it’s proof that Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.”
“To our Veterans, whether you are among the
vanishing generations of heroes who served in 
World War II and the Korean War, or whether you are one of the heroes of
Afghanistan or conflict zones around the world, you deserve our gratitude,”
said Scheer.  
“When we look out for our Veterans, we are looking
out for the people who dedicated their lives to looking out for us. It’s time
for government that will stand up for our Veterans. It’s time for a
Conservative government that will help you get ahead.”

Justin Trudeau is lying and misrepresenting the Conservative plan to support infrastructure projects across Canada. Let’s look at the facts. Public policy expert Jack Mintz confirmed that the Conservative plan only “delays” infrastructure spending by three years. He also confirmed that these delays only impact “uncommitted infrastructure spending”.  In contrast, the Liberals cut up to 40% of infrastructure spending from 2016-2017.  The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) agrees. The PBO confirms that the Conservative plan will extend “spending for the Investing in Canada Plan (ICP) over an eleven-year period, rather than the eight-year period.” The PBO also says that the Conservative plan would “spread the same nominal amount of money over a longer period of time”. The PBO also confirmed that our plan continues “funding obligations already committed to by the Government”.  Justin Trudeau is lying to Canadians. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives will maintain infrastructure spending. Instead we will cut corporate welfare and foreign aid to relatively wealthy countries in order to lower taxes and help you get ahead. https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/ElectionProposalCosting/Results/33020559_EN.pdf?timestamp=1570992945242 https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/Reports/2019/Main_estimates_2019_20/The%20Government%E2%80%99s%20Expenditure%20Plan%20and%20Main%20Estimates%20for%202019-20_EN.pdf.pdf

Trudeau is campaigning with two planes, emitting more than double the amount of other campaigns
Despite marching in climate strikes,
lecturing everybody else on lowering emissions, and imposing a carbon tax on
hard-working Canadians, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are secretly using two
aircraft to campaign in this election.
Conservatives have confirmed that Trudeau’s official
Boeing 737-800 campaign planes (his official branded plane and two
replacements) have been travelling with a second aircraft – a 40-year-old
Boeing 737-200 with tail number C-GNLE.
His official branded plane – tail number C-GTQB – and the second plane were spotted on the tarmac together at Pearson Airport in Toronto yesterday:



Flight records show his three official planes have been accompanied by the second plane throughout the campaign:

Not only is Trudeau running with two
aircraft, his second plane is by far the highest-emitting aircraft in the
campaign. The Boeing 737-200 burns through a staggering 975 gallons of jet fuel
an hour. His official branded plane burns between 800
and 850 gallons an hour.
By comparison, Jagmeet Singh’s NDP plane burns 795 gallons an hour and
Andrew Scheer’s Conservative plane burns 640
gallons an hour.
That means Trudeau’s campaign is emitting nearly three times as
much as the Conservative campaign.
“Canadians are tired of being lectured to and taxed by a
high-carbon hypocrite like Justin Trudeau,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
said. “As usual, there’s one set of rules for him, and one set of rules for the
rest of us. He is simply not as advertised.”

Minister he will appoint Kevin Falcon, the former deputy premier and finance
minister of British Columbia, and Yves Desjardins-Siciliano, the former
president and CEO of VIA Rail Canada, to lead the Commission on
the Reduction of Government Subsidy Programs to Corporations. This is the first
announcement of Andrew Scheer’s 100 Day Action Plan – the steps a new
Conservative government would take to help Canadians get ahead. 
“You shouldn’t have to be a billionaire to get your
government’s attention,” Scheer said. “You deserve a government, and a Prime
Minister, whose first priority will be to help you get ahead.”
The Commission on
the Reduction of Government Subsidy Programs to Corporations will
review all business subsidy programs, including grants and contributions to
corporations. The commission’s mandate will include:
Reducing corporate subsidies by $1.5 billion
per yearRecommending performance metrics for corporate
subsidy programsReviewing innovation programs to ensure that
they are supporting Canadian companies that provide benefits, profits and
patents that stay in Canada.
The commission will be operated out of the Department
of Finance. A new Conservative government will also strengthen Canada’s regional development agencies, focusing on helping
small and medium businesses to grow.
“There is a truism I’ve
learned watching governments of all stripes throw taxpayer dollars at
undeserving corporations. Governments have a terrible record of picking between
winners and losers. I’m proud to have been part of a government that eliminated
all corporate subsidies, grants and equity investments to individual for-profit
businesses. I applaud the Conservative party and Andrew Scheer for their
commitment to scale back this corporate welfare and redirect it where it
belongs, in the pockets of Canadian families,” Falcon said. 
“As in
all areas of government, spending taxpayers’ money must be efficient and
produce the greatest benefits to Canada’s economy. I’m honoured to co-chair
this review with a distinguished Canadian, and I’m confident our review will
yield the expected benefits,” said Desjardins-Siciliano. 
“Hard-working
Canadians are rightly offended when they see their tax dollars going to further
the interests of the wealthy and well-connected friends, while Justin Trudeau
makes them pay more for gasoline, groceries, and home heating,” Scheer said.

Justin Trudeau failed to deliver the infrastructure he promised to Canadians
The independent Parliamentary Budget Officer
(PBO) confirmed that Justin Trudeau was unable to deliver 40% of the budgeted
infrastructure he promised.
In contrast Andrew Scheer will extend the Investing in
Canada Plan by an additional three years so that the entire $187-billion
program is spent over 15 years instead of 12.
Conservatives worked with the PBO to ensure that our
infrastructure plan:
Maintains all projects committed to by the Liberal Government;Maintains the Gas Tax Fund and Goods and Services Tax rebate to municipalities at the same levels; andFunds important projects such as: The George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project (British Columbia);The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension (Ontario); andThe third link between Quebec City and Levis (Québec).

Trudeau’s plan puts you further in debt while Andrew Scheer’s plan puts more money in your pocket
Today Justin Trudeau announced
interest-free loans for Canadians to renovate their homes. But Canadians who
are struggling to make-ends-meet can’t afford a loan to renovate their house
while Justin Trudeau continues to hike taxes and make life more unaffordable.
Justin Trudeau wants you to take on as much as
$40,000 in debt to make your home energy efficient, while Andrew Scheer has a
plan to put more money in your pocket, as much as $3,800. 
Trudeau’s green renovation plan will require you to
be audited by the government, not once but twice. Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives
won’t require the government to come to your house and tell you how to renovate
your home. 
Trudeau’s Liberals will even make you pay for one
of these audits. 
What’s worse, to pay for this loan program, Justin
Trudeau is going to use the money you paid the CHMC to help wealthy landlords
replace the windows and roofs on their investment properties. 
In fact, part of Trudeau’s plan only applies to the
very rich who can afford expensive homes.
Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have a plan a
better plan to help you get ahead by making Canadians eligible to receive a 20%
refundable credit on their income tax for green improvements to their homes of
over $1,000 and up to $20,000. This would allow Canadians to save up to $3,800
on their renovations each year.

Trudeau Liberals’ have put home ownership further out of reach for Canadians
Today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced that a new Conservative
government would introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time
homebuyers to buy a home.
“With his poor judgement and tax hikes, Justin Trudeau has put the
dream of home ownership further out of reach for so many, especially young
Canadians,” Scheer said. “As Prime Minister, I will fix his bad policies and
work to get more homes on the market to lower the price of housing.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will: 
Fix the mortgage stress test to ensure that first-time homebuyers aren’t unnecessarily prevented from accessing mortgages and work with OSFI to remove the stress test from mortgage renewals to give homeowners more options. Increase amortization periods on insured mortgages to 30 years for first-time homebuyers to lower monthly payments. Launch an inquiry into money laundering in the real estate sector and work with our industry partners to root out corrupt practices that inflate housing prices. Make surplus federal real estate available for development to increase the supply of housing. 
Canada’s
Conservatives know the government has an important role to play to put home
ownership within reach for more Canadians. When you work hard, save, and invest
in your future, the government should help you – not stand in your way. 
FACTS
New data shows the country’s youngest
buyers are affected most by the Trudeau Liberals’
stress test.Justin Trudeau’s latest homebuyer “incentive” has
so many terms and conditions that most first-time homebuyers don’t qualify.
What’s more, it only targets select cities.Right now, more than 80
per cent of middle-income families are paying $800 more in taxes a year than
they did in 2015. The cost of housing continues to skyrocket, and the carbon
tax means that everyday necessities like gas, groceries and heating your home
keep getting more and more expensive. It’s harder than ever before to save for
a down payment or monthly bills. Justin Trudeau has proven that he
can’t be trusted to help Canadians get ahead. If he’s given four more years,
his carbon tax will cost Canadians hundreds of dollars a year. Life is
expensive enough for Canadian families without Justin Trudeau costing them even
more.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs. Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest-income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boosting the government’s matching RESP contributions by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids education. For some, that could be $540 more.

A new Conservative government would take measures to safeguard against abuse of power
In Justin Trudeau’s
riding of Papineau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today that a
new Conservative government would launch a judicial inquiry into the
SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.
A new Conservative government will also introduce the No More Cover-Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access information protected by cabinet confidence by making an application to the Supreme Court of Canada. This will prevent corrupt politicians from hiding behind cabinet confidence to escape police investigation. 
As confirmed by
hours of Parliamentary testimony, taped conversations, and an Ethics
Commissioner’s guilty verdict, Trudeau politically interfered in SNC-Lavalin’s
criminal prosecution by trying to “circumvent, undermine, and ultimately attempt
to discredit” former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould.
However, to
this day, Trudeau refuses to waive cabinet confidence, keeping important
details of the scandal secret and preventing several key witnesses, including
Ms. Wilson-Raybould, from disclosing evidence.
“Justin Trudeau
has covered up his role in the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal every step of the
way,” Scheer said. “He blocked three Parliamentary investigations, refused to
co-operate with the Ethics Commissioner, and is currently blocking the RCMP
from obtaining key evidence. As Prime Minister, I will call a judicial inquiry
so Canadians can finally get the answers they deserve.”
“No longer will
a corrupt Prime Minister be able to be the gatekeeper of his own misconduct,”
said Scheer. “These measures will safeguard our democracy against the whims of
sleazy and unscrupulous politicians. Justin Trudeau has so far avoided
consequence for the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal, but the Canadian people
will deliver their verdict on October 21.” 
FACTS: 
In
2017, Justin Trudeau became the first Prime Minister in Canadian history to be
found guilty of breaking ethics laws for accepting a vacation from a lobbyist.
In August, he was found guilty again for his role in the SNC-Lavalin corruption
scandal.Trudeau
abused the power of his office to shut down two separate Ethics Committee
investigations and a Justice Committee investigation.In
his final report, Trudeau II, Ethics
Commissioner Mario Dion noted, “During this examination, nine witnesses
informed our Office that they had information they believed to be relevant, but
that could not be disclosed because, according to them, this information would
reveal a confidence of the Queen’s Privy Council and would fall outside the
scope of Order in Council 2019-0105.”Right
before the election, Canadians learned the RCMP is being prevented from
investigating possible obstruction of justice because Trudeau refuses to waive
cabinet confidence.

Trudeau’s candidate continues to support individual with known antisemitic views

















According to B’nai
Brith Canada, Justin Trudeau’s candidate Iqra Khalid continues to associate
with known anitsemite Amin El-Maoued, who advocates for violence and
discrimination against the Jewish community.




Khalid was forced to apologize last year for giving
El-Maoued a certificate of appreciation from Justin Trudeau. At the time Khalid
claimed she condemned his antisemitic views. 
But we now know her apology was a lie.
Recently Khalid attended an event at the home
of El-Maoued. He confirmed in social media posts that Khalid apologized to him
for condemning his antisemitism. El-Maoued blames the “Zionist lobby” for
forcing Khalid to having to issue a public apology.
In response to this news, Khalid says that she
accepts that El-Maoued is not antisemtic, despite the fact that he uses
antisemitic language and leads rallies to call for the destruction of Israel.
El-Maoued is active in the Liberal Party of
Canada, donating and attending party conventions with Justin Trudeau.
Antisemites like Khalid and El-Maoued feel they
have a home in Trudeau’s Liberal Party. 
But what Jewish Canadians are asking is: why did Justin Trudeau fire antisemite Hassan Guillet but continues to support Iqra Khalid?

Yesterday, the NDP let the cat out of the
bag: They are planning to form a coalition government with Justin Trudeau if
Canadians don’t elect a Conservative majority government on Oct. 21.
When asked about it today, Trudeau did not rule out a
Liberal/NDP coalition, which would see NDP MPs given key cabinet positions with
Trudeau as Prime Minister.
With Trudeau forced to rely on the NDP to hang on to
power, what will that mean for you?
An even higher carbon tax. Trudeau is already planning to hike
     the carbon tax if he’s re-elected. But to keep the NDP happy, he’ll have
     to hike it even higher.
      Fewer jobs. NDP economic policies fail
     everywhere they’ve been tried. With the NDP calling the shots, Trudeau
     will have to hike taxes, shut down industry, and kill jobs to hang on to
     power.
      Even bigger deficits. To meet the NDP’s demands, Trudeau
     will have to spend billions more than he was already planning to, racking
     up huge deficits that will threaten social programs like health care.
Justin Trudeau will pay any price to stay in power. And
it’s your money he will pay with.
There’s only one way for Canadians to stop this coalition
that you cannot afford: Vote for Andrew Scheer and elect a Conservative
majority government.

Singh doubled-down yesterday reminding Canadians that he’s “fully opposed to Trans Mountain”.Meanwhile, Trudeau’s star candidate in Quebec confirmed that under Trudeau’s plan “many of these [pipelines] are incompatible with the goals we have for 2030”.The Trudeau-NDP coalition is the coalition you can’t afford. Their radical position on pipeline development will mean fewer jobs for Canadians and less future revenue that can be put toward health care, education and social services across Canada.As a result, a Trudeau-NDP coalition would be forced to raise taxes on middle-class Canadians in order to fund any new health care spending.Only Andrew Scheer and the Conservative Party has a plan to build a national energy corridor that will encourage greater investment in the Canadian energy sector.

A new Conservative government will fund projects that get Canadians home faster, reduce commute times
A new Conservative government will fund the Ontario Line and Yonge
Subway Extension projects as part of a plan to prioritize projects that get
Canadians home faster, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension are two great
examples of projects that reduce commute times and relieve traffic congestion
for hard-working commuters,” Scheer said.
“These are exactly the kinds of infrastructure projects a new
Conservative government will prioritize and I’m pleased to announce that as
Prime Minister, my government will fund them.” 
The 7.4-kilometre Yonge Subway
Extension will connect Toronto to Markham, Vaughan and Richmond Hill – one of
the fastest growing regions in Ontario. The 15-kilometre Ontario Line will
increase capacity by 30 per cent on a critically needed east-west and
north-south route. 
Scheer was joined by Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti and Richmond
Hill Mayor David Barrow and pointed out that despite a $187 billion infrastructure
spending commitment, Justin Trudeau has failed to deliver much-needed commuter
infrastructure for Canadians.
“Justin Trudeau was elected on a promise to invest in
infrastructure and get these kinds of projects built. But four years later, he
has spent the money but has nothing to show for it. We got the deficits without
the infrastructure,” Scheer said. “Once again, he is not as advertised.”
Only Canada’s Conservatives have a plan to lower your taxes and
put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead. We will build the
desperately needed infrastructure Canadians need to get home faster at the end
of the day.
FACTS:
Commute times in Toronto are
up an
average of almost 8 per cent since 2013, with
an average commute of 42 minutes.The Ontario Line is estimated
to cost $10.9 billion and is scheduled to be complete by 2027.The Yonge Subway Extension is
estimated to cost $5.6 billion and should be operational right after the
Ontario Line opens. A new Conservative government
would fund projects that reduce commute times across the country like the George
Massey Tunnel replacement project in Vancouver and the third link across the
Saint Lawrence River in Québec City.According to the Parliamentary
Budget Officer (PBO), for every dollar
Justin Trudeau promised for infrastructure, he only spent 60 cents: “the
Government failed to spend about 40 per cent of its planned infrastructure
budget.” Analysis
showed that for all his spending, there are no substantial results to show for
it.In its analysis of Budget 2018,
the PBO reported:
“Budget 2018 provides an incomplete account of the changes to the Government’s
$186.7 billion infrastructure spending plan. PBO requested the new plan but it
does not exist.”If given four more years,
Justin Trudeau’s debt and never-ending deficits will delay badly needed
infrastructure, threatening the future of important projects like the Ontario
Line and Yonge Subway Extension, and doing nothing to reduce commute times.Trudeau’s Carbon tax will add
31 cents a litre to the price of gas, adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of
everyday essentials. In Ontario, his carbon tax will cost you over a thousand
dollars each and every year. 
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:

Yet we find ourselves now in a more polarized, more divisive election than even the 2015 one.” Justin Trudeau disparages the 19 million Canadians these leaders represent. He is a hypocrite and cannot be trusted to unite Canadians. Trudeau is simply not as advertised. Regardless of our differences, or our political views, politicians should never pit Canadians against one another.

This is just another example of how Justin Trudeau will do and say anything to get re-elected, even turn Canadians against each other for his own political gain.

Conservatives unveil fully costed platform that eliminates Justin Trudeau’s deficit by 2024.
Today, Canada’s Conservatives released Andrew Scheer’s
Plan for You to Get Ahead, a fully
costed platform that details how a new Conservative government will live within
its means and put more money in your pockets.
In his remarks, Andrew Scheer
offered examples of how typical Canadian families will get ahead under a new
Conservative government:
Under a new Conservative government,
an average retired couple living in Tsawwassen will save $2,580 a year.Under a new Conservative government, a family of four – soon to be five –
in Montreal will save $4,642 a year.Under a new Conservative government,
a family of four in Markham will save $3,264 a year.
“Under
Justin Trudeau, Canadians are working harder and harder, but they’re just not
getting ahead. Everything keeps getting more expensive and if Trudeau is
re-elected, it will only get worse,” Scheer said.
“My Plan For You To Get Ahead is filled with
achievable and tangible ways that a new Conservative government under my
leadership will put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.”
The Conservative
platform also shows a costed and independently verified path back to a balanced
budget by 2024-2025. This will be done through a combination of spending
restraint and reductions to both corporate handouts to profitable corporations
and foreign aid to relatively wealthy countries.
“My
plan eliminates Justin Trudeau’s damaging deficits because Conservatives know a
balanced budget is the only way to make sure services like health care are
protected,” Scheer said. 
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will provide:
1. More money for you, for your kids, and for your retirement 
By scrapping Trudeau’s carbon tax, providing a Universal Tax Cut, taking the GST off home heating, making maternity benefits tax-free, boosting the RESP, increasing the Age Credit, bringing back tax credits for children’s arts, fitness, and learning, and introducing the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit.
2. More good jobs
By reversing Trudeau’s tax hikes on small business, creating a National Energy Corridor to generate opportunities, boosting innovation and commercialization, supporting economic immigration, promoting interprovincial trade, building infrastructure projects that reduce commute times and lower emissions, and more.
3. More innovation to fight climate change 
By taking the fight against climate change global and incentivizing industry to develop emissions-reducing technology that can be shared with the world’s highest-emitting countries.
4. More help at home
By supporting our veterans, improving our correctional system, securing our neighbourhoods, strengthening border protection, reducing health care wait times, and more.
5. More strength abroad 
By
confronting the global complexities of climate change, human migration,
cybersecurity, and national defence, renewing relationships with important
allies, and standing up for Canada on the world stage. 
“It’s
time to turn the page on four years of broken promises. As Canadians, it’s time
for Canadians to look to the future once again with confidence,” Scheer said. 
The
platform was verified by Jack Mintz, President’s Fellow at the University of
Calgary’s School of Public Policy.
“I
conclude, therefore, that the Conservative Party fiscal plan is reasonably
estimated, resulting in a budgetary balance in five years subject to
uncertainties that impact any economic forecast including those of the PBO,”
Mintz said.

Andrew Scheer will make it easier for
Canadian families to welcome a new child into their home by introducing EI
adoption leave benefits for adoptive parents and boosting the Adoption Expense
Tax Credit, David Sweet, the Conservative candidate for Flamborough-Glanbrook,
announced today.
“Every year, thousands of Canadians adopt a child. By
opening their homes and their hearts, these families provide stability, love,
and a brighter future for some of the most vulnerable in Canada and around the
world,” Sweet said. “Adoption is one of the most selfless things a Canadian can
do. At the same time, it can also involve significant investments of time and money.
Andrew Scheer will make it easier for Canadians to begin, expand, or complete
their family through adoption.”
A new Conservative government will introduce 15 weeks of
EI adoption leave benefits for Canadians who adopt a child under the age of 18.
A new Conservative government will also amend the Income Tax Act to boost the
Adoption Expense Tax Credit to $20,000, and make the tax credit fully
refundable. As a result, those who pay little to no federal income tax will be
eligible for up to the maximum amount.
Currently, the maximum tax savings a Canadian adoptive
family is eligible to receive in 2020 is $2,482. Under a new Conservative
government, that same family will receive $3,000,
which is an increase of $518. The tax credit
will continue to be indexed as is currently the case.
“Introducing EI adoption leave benefits for adoptive
parents and boosting the Adoption Expense Tax Credit are two of the measures a
new Conservative government will introduce to help Canadian families get
ahead,” Sweet said.

Conservative foreign policy will cut aid spending by 25% and put it back in the pockets of Canadian families
Today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer detailed
his plan for delivering strong Conservative leadership on the world stage.
On the same day the Munk debate on foreign policy
was supposed to take place before Justin Trudeau forced its cancellation, Scheer
shared details around four key pillars of his foreign policy plan which
include:
Cutting 25% of foreign
aid spending – The reduction will come from middle- and upper-income countries
as well as hostile regimes. We will use the savings to pay for policies that
help Canadians get ahead at home and also redirect
$700 million to strengthen foreign aid in the countries that need it most. We
will continue to work in partnership with leading Canadian aid organizations
including volunteer-focused groups who provide much-needed assistance to
developing countries.
Strengthening
Canada’s commitment to traditional alliances and providing additional military
and non-military support to Ukraine.
Advocating for human
rights on the world stage by using Canada’s Magnitsky legislation to target
hostile regimes like Iran.
Depoliticizing
military procurement in order to properly and expediently supply the Canadian
Armed Forces.
“Justin Trudeau has spent the last four years
humiliating himself and all Canadians on the world stage with his weak,
unprincipled leadership,” Scheer said. “Canadians deserve a Prime Minister that
will once again make them proud and who will always stand up for Canada’s
interests in an increasingly hostile world.”
Scheer highlighted the long and growing list of
scandals and humiliations that have harmed Canada’s reputation during Justin
Trudeau’s time in power, including his admiration for China’s “basic
dictatorship,” his praise for Cuban communist dictator Fidel Castro, his disastrous
India trip, and his disgraceful Omar Khadr settlement.
On foreign aid, Scheer said his plan will refocus Canadian
help where it is most needed while helping more Canadians get ahead at home.
“At a time when Canadians are working harder than
ever and not getting ahead, Trudeau is using their hard-earned tax dollars to
support antisemitic organizations and prop up foreign dictatorships,” Scheer
concluded. “Our plan will take Canadian tax dollars away from corrupt dictators
and wealthy countries and return it to Canadians so they can get ahead.
“At the same time, we will continue to consider aid proposals
which support non-development objectives such as minority rights and peaceful
coexistence taking place in any country,” Scheer said.

Trudeau Liberals to send another $2.544 billion dollars in debt interest payments to bankers and foreign creditors
Canadians know that Justin Trudeau is not
as advertised, and now we know that their platform is not as advertised either.

The Trudeau Liberals are failing to
account for changes in public debt charges as a result of their endless
deficits. 
In total, the Trudeau Liberal platform will send an additional $2.544 billion dollars to bankers and foreign creditors to pay for their out-of-control spending. 

The PBO offered all parties costing tools
to determine the changes to public debt charges. Clearly, the Trudeau Liberals
didn’t use these tools or the Trudeau Liberals intentionally left the numbers
out of their fiscal track. 
On top of that, a number of Trudeau Liberal promises remain un-costed by an independent analysis:  
Pharmacare; 
Net-zero emissions by 2050; 
Assigning a family doctor to every Canadian; 
Lowering after-school fees by 10 per cent; 
 High
speed internet across the country
Guaranteed paid family leave; 
With the release of their platform, Justin
Trudeau’s Liberals are doubling down on their endless deficits that threaten
the social services, like health care and education, we all depend on. 
If Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are
re-elected, they will do what they did last time and hike your taxes to pay for
their out-of-control spending. 
Additional information: 
Justin Trudeau’s campaign promises added to his existing deficits will pile on $100 billion of new      debt to the books;His deficit will hit $27.4 billion in 2020; and,Total debt by the end of Justin Trudeau’s second term would be over $800 billion.
What does that mean for you? Justin
Trudeau’s never-ending spending will threaten the quality of our health and
social programs. He will be forced to raise taxes to pay for his endless debt
and deficits.

Justin Trudeau is scheming up a plot to
cling to power by forming a coalition with the NDP. This is the coalition that
you cannot afford.
We know that the Trudeau-NDP coalition will mean:
Higher taxes;Bigger deficits;And, fewer good-paying jobs.
The last time there was a Liberal-NDP coalition was from
October 1972 to July 8, 1974 under Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.

In less than two years,
the Liberal-NDP coalition:
Jacked up personal income taxes by 40 per cent.Increased taxes on job creators by 66 per cent.Raised other taxes by 61 per cent.Increased Canada’s total debt by 19 per cent.

Trudeau bailing on Munk debate shows he can’t be trusted to represent Canada on the international stage
The Munk Leaders Debate on Foreign Policy was
cancelled after Justin Trudeau refused to show up and debate Andrew Scheer and
other leaders. 
It’s not surprising that Trudeau is running from his
record of disastrous foreign policy decisions, embarrassing behaviour, and
refusal to stand up for Canada’s interests against hostile foreign powers. 
When Justin Trudeau was first elected in 2015 he
proclaimed that Canada was back. Instead, he has diminished Canada’s role on
the world stage by:
Pulling our troops out of the fight against ISIS and
initially refusing to acknowledge the genocide being committed by the Islamic
State;Damaging relations with Canada’s allies like Japan and
Australia;Embarrassing Canadians by bringing a known terrorist
on an official visit to India;Refusing to list the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps as a terrorist entity;Sending millions of Canadian taxpayers dollars to the
Beijing-controlled Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank at the same time that
the government is holding two Canadians hostage on specious charges; andGiving $110 million to the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency, which supports terrorism and antisemitism. 
But perhaps the biggest hit to Canada’s international reputation came last week when Justin Trudeau made headlines all over the world for wearing blackface on multiple occasions. Justin Trudeau cannot be trusted to represent Canada with dignity and poise on the international stage. He is not as advertised.

Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, today released the following statement on Bandi Chhor Divas:
“Today, Sikhs across Canada and around the world will be celebrating Bandi Chhor Divas.  
“Bandi Chhor Divas marks a significant moment in Sikh history – the day when the sixth Guru, Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, freed 52 prisoners imprisoned by the Mughal Emperor and returned triumphantly to Amritsar. This historic event is symbolic and demonstrative of the role that Sikhs have and continue to play in protecting and serving the community.

“The Sikh faith is known for promoting the values of prayer, selfless service to others, and honest living. Today, in celebration of these virtues, Sikhs will be lighting divas, singing songs of praise and attending prayers at Gurdwaras across the country.  
“As divas and fireworks light up the night, all Canadians can reflect today on the freedoms and blessings that make Canada the great country that it is while praying for a brighter and more prosperous future.

 New Conservative government to remove museum admission fees, celebrate past Prime Ministers 
A new Conservative government will scrap
admission fees from all of Canada’s national museums, Conservative Leader
Andrew Scheer announced today.
Removing these fees will make it easier for families to
learn about Canada’s proud history and will make school field trips and family
vacations more affordable.
“National museums celebrate Canada by sharing our
foundational stories and most cherished artifacts, the very things that make us
Canadian. They are places of beauty, discovery, and inspiration,” said Scheer.
“Making them more accessible to Canadians and visitors is part of our plan to
celebrate Canadian culture and make life more affordable for families across
the country.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will make it free to
visit national museums 365 days a year for every visitor.
There are nine national museums across Canada:
Canada Agriculture and Food Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum of History (Gatineau, Quebec)Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 (Halifax, Nova Scotia)Canada Science and Technology Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa, Ontario)Canada Aviation and Space Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum of Nature (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum for Human Rights (Winnipeg, Manitoba)Canadian War Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)
A new Conservative government will also designate the RCMP
Heritage Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan as a national museum. Admission would
also be free.
Scheer announced that a new Conservative government will
also designate the gravesites of past Prime Ministers and Governors General as
national historic sites.
“We can and we should celebrate the achievements of our
historical giants like William Lyon Mackenzie King, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and
Sir John A. Macdonald,” Scheer said. “These leaders, and others, have left
their mark not only on our country, but on the entire world and they are worthy
of honour and respect.”
FACTS:
The first National Museum of Canada was established by the Department of Mines in 1927.The current system of national museums (listed above) are administered by six Crown Corporations.According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, this move would save Canadians more than $20 million per year.Admission fees generally represent small proportions of these museums’ revenue mix; these other revenue streams, including Parliamentary appropriations, will not be impacted by this measure, except to increase the appropriations to compensate for reduced revenue from this policy.Smithsonian Institution museums in Washington, D.C. have offered free admission since 1846.

Investment will reduce wait times for potentially life-saving scans 
A new Conservative government will invest $1.5 billion in its
first term to purchase MRI machines and CT machines to replace aging equipment and
add machines across the country, reducing wait times for potentially
life-saving tests for Canadians, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“Hundreds of thousands of Canadians wait longer than the recommended
time for an MRI or a CT scan. That is just not good enough”, said Scheer. “This
investment will help our health care providers to deliver quality services with
the most up-to-date technology, giving patients quicker access to reliable,
potentially life-saving tests.”
Justin Trudeau’s never-ending deficits and out-of-control
spending have put Canada on track to hit $1 trillion in debt by 2035. If
Trudeau is given four more years, his debt and never-ending deficits will
threaten our ability to deliver quality public services like health and social
programs.
A
new Conservative government will live within its means to protect health care
in the long term. As written in a letter to all Premiers in August 2019, as
Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will maintain and increase the current funding
formula for the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer. 
“Canadians need a government that understands that balancing the budget is the best way to maintain the services that they rely on the most, including health care,” Scheer said. “Canada’s Conservatives will give you more help for your health, so you can get ahead.”
FACTS:
Justin Trudeau said he would balance the budget
by 2019. Instead, he has raised taxes, imposed a carbon tax, and his massive overspending
now puts health and social programs at risk.According to a recent report
by the Conference
Board of Canada, Canada’s stock of MRI and CT
machines is aging, supply is not keeping up with demand, and wait times for
these important diagnostic tests exceed the wait-time recommendations from the
Canadian Association of Radiologists. By upgrading and increasing available
medical imaging equipment, Canadians will have better, faster access to quality
tests. Getting earlier access to a test could mean an earlier diagnosis for the
patient. In addition to improving wait
times, this investment will also give provincial governments some additional
spending flexibility, as the federal government would pick up the bill for
replacing out-of-date imaging equipment that the provinces would likely have to
replace. Demand for medical imaging
tests is only expected to increase as our population ages.

New Conservative government to make it easier for volunteers to qualify for tax credits recognizing their service 
A new Conservative government will allow more search and rescue volunteers and volunteer firefighters to qualify for tax savings, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today. 
“Communities across Canada rely on
volunteers for essential services like fire protection and search and rescue,”
Scheer said. “These are people of courage, character, and strength who step up
when their neighbours need it most, often at significant personal expense. A
new Conservative government will recognize this service and sacrifice by making
it easier for them to qualify for tax savings so they can get ahead.”
A new Conservative government will put
more money back in the pockets of these hometown heroes by reducing the number
of service hours required to qualify for federal tax credits from 200 to 150
hours per year.
Volunteers
often pay out-of-pocket for equipment, uniforms, transportation, training, and
insurance – costs that run into the thousands of dollars. 
Volunteers
will continue to receive a $450 rebate every year. The Parliamentary Budget
Officer estimates that lowering the number of required hours by 50 will allow more
than 5,000 additional volunteers to apply for and receive these benefits. 
Scheer
made today’s announcement in New Brunswick, where volunteer search and rescue
teams have been active for more than 35 years. Upper Kingsclear also relies on volunteer
firefighters for its protection, several of whom were on hand for today’s announcement.
 “A new Conservative government will live
within its means and put more money back in your pockets – for you, for your
family, and your retirement,” Scheer said. 
FACTS:
Last
year, the National Fire Protection Association reports that of the 152,650 local firefighters
in Canada from 2014-16, 126,650 (83 per cent) were volunteers. That same report
found that of 3,672 fire departments in Canada, 3,061 are all-volunteer.The
Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada (SARVAC) says 9,000 volunteers serve on 300 search and
rescue teams across the country. All told, these volunteers contribute more
than 600,000 hours of training, administration, and searches each year.The
previous Conservative government introduced the Volunteer Firefighter Tax Credit
in Budget 2011 and the Search and Rescue Volunteer Tax
Credit in Budget 2014.In
2016, nearly 43,000 individuals claimed the Volunteer Firefighter Tax Credit
and 4,800 individuals claimed the Search and Rescue Volunteer Tax Credit.Justin
Trudeau has done nothing with these tax credits and nothing for these
volunteers.

Oliphant explains how “conflicted” he is about Remembrance Day and
his belief that it tends to “glorify war.”

deserve.

our Veterans are heroes. They dedicated their lives to protecting us.  Now it is our responsibility to respect their
service by doing our part to look out for them.

After media reports revealed that Justin
Trudeau wore blackface during an event at West Point Grey Academy, Canadians
have been asking why exactly Justin Trudeau left his teaching job at the
school. It’s understandable why people have questions, after all Trudeau’s
story has changed four times since 2001. 
First, the Ottawa Citizen reported in 2001
that Trudeau would “give up his teaching job at
a Vancouver private school next September to give speeches.” Several days later
this claim was refuted by Trudeau in a statement issued by lawfirm Heenan
Blaikie. The Montreal Gazette reported Trudeau was accepting a teaching job at
a public school. 
In his 2014 autobiography, Trudeau says he
left the school after a dispute with the administration over an article written
in the school newspaper. According to Trudeau, he convinced a student to write
an article criticizing the fact that the girls at the school were never
reprimanded for the way they dress. This article was deemed disrespectful by
the school’s administration. 
The Vancouver Sun reported in 2015 that the reason Trudeau left the school was “in part over a dispute over dress code and values.”
In a 2019
book by John Ivison, Trudeau’s departure is summed up as “a disagreement over
an article written by a student for which Trudeau was responsible”.
On October 4, 2019 Trudeau said he left the school “because [he] was moving on
with [his] life”.
That same day, the former headmaster of
the school said that Trudeau left the school because he was going to study to
be an engineer.

New tax credit will allow Canadians to save up to $3,800 on green home renovations
Conservative
Leader Andrew Scheer was at Potvin & Bouchard today, highlighting the Conservatives’
proposed Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, a two-year program to encourage
homeowners to renovate their homes in ways that lower their power bills and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Canadians
will be eligible to receive a 20% refundable credit on their income tax for
green improvements to their homes of over $1,000 and up to $20,000. This would
allow Canadians to save up to $3,800
on their renovations each year.
Eligible renovations would include: 
Installation of high-quality insulation Investments in high-efficiency furnaces Replacement of doors and windows with more efficient models Upgrading of ventilation, heating and cooling systemsInstallation of solar panels 
In
2017, emissions from buildings represented 12% of Canada’s overall emissions. 
“No
environmental plan is complete without a serious plan to tackle emissions from
buildings,” Scheer said. “Our Green Home Renovation Tax Credit will help lower
these emissions and fight climate change while putting more money in Canadians’
pockets so they can get ahead.”
This measure is one of the 55 policies of our environmental plan, A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment, introduced earlier this year. It is a realistic plan that balances Canada’s obligation to fight climate change with the core Conservative promise to put more money in Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead.
FACTS:
Justin Trudeau’s signature so-called environmental policy is, in reality, not an environmental policy at all. His Carbon Tax gives big polluters a pass while punishing Canadians for driving to work and heating their homes.Canadian families and small businesses pay 92% of Trudeau’s Carbon Tax, while big polluters are only on the hook for 8%. Justin Trudeau and his environment minister have confirmed that a carbon tax hike is on the table, and the Conservative Party conducted research to determine just how much it would cost the average Canadian household. At the $102/ tonne level, Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would Increase the cost of natural gas by $469 per year Add 31 cents/litre to the price of gasoline. This means $2/litre gasoline is just around the corner if the Trudeau Liberals are re-elected. It is Canadians who bear the cost of Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax. In Ontario, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,151.In New Brunswick, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $959.In Manitoba, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,116.In Saskatchewan, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,930.In Alberta, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $2,002.
Andrew Scheer’s Plan for you to get ahead:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax,

Trudeau continues to assert that media stories are false despite ruling that he broke the law
Last night Justin Trudeau unrepentantly lied
again to Canadians about the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal. In a debate
exchange with Mr. Scheer, Justin Trudeau shockingly asserted that a Globe and Mail
story, which first detailed how Justin Trudeau attempted to interfere in an
ongoing corruptions and fraud court case, was false.

How do Canadians know Justin Trudeau lied last night? Check the record:
Trudeau was investigated by the Ethics Commissioner who determined he broke the law over the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal; Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould confirmed      to a House of Commons committee that Trudeau pressured her to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin court case;Trudeau’s two most senior staff resigned in disgrace and former cabinet minister Jane Philpot resigned      in protest over Trudeau’s unethical behavior; andThe RCMP were blocked from investigating Justin Trudeau’s office.
Despite all this, Justin Trudeau still says the Globe and
Mail story is false.
Why? Because Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. He is a
fraud and he does not deserve to govern this country.
To ensure this never happens again, a Conservative
government will launch a judicial inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin corruption
scandal and introduce the No More Cover Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access
information protected by cabinet confidence.

Conservatives will spend final week outlining government agenda for first 100 days
Over the next several days, Conservative
Leader Andrew Scheer will announce the first things a new Conservative
government will do during its first 100 days in office.
“Canadians are getting ready to elect a new government and
I plan on telling them exactly what we will do in our first 100 days,” Scheer
said. “I am ready. My team is ready. We have a plan to put more money in your
pockets so you can get ahead and we will hit the ground running on day one.”
Scheer unveiled the Conservative platform earlier today in
Tsawwassen, BC – a fully costed plan that will put thousands of dollars back
into Canadians’ pockets while also eliminating Justin Trudeau’s deficits by
2024.
Scheer said he will spend the final week of the campaign
travelling the country announcing to Canadians specific things he will do as
soon as he becomes Prime Minister.
“In 2015, Justin Trudeau made a lot of promises to get
elected – and he started breaking them as soon as he was sworn into office,”

through on what we’ve committed to.”

Today, Justin
Trudeau and the Liberals are unveiling their election platform – much like the
2015 version it’s not worth the wasted ink and the paper it’s printed on. 
In the last
election, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals promised a lot, but once elected they
broke promise after promise and made life more expensive and unaffordable for
families. Plain and simple, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. If Justin
Trudeau is re-elected he will once again break his promises to Canadians and
raise taxes on hard-working Canadian families. 
Let’s take a
look at some of Justin Trudeau’s most notable broken promises. 
Balanced
Budgets: 
“I am
looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way I always have. We’ve
said we are committed to balanced budgets and we are. We will balance that
budget in 2019.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
It’s 2019, and
as we can see the budget did not “balance itself.” Justin Trudeau is running
endless deficits that threaten the social services Canadians depend on and if
re-elected Trudeau will just raise your taxes to pay for his out of control
spending. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Electoral
Reform: 
“As Prime
Minister, I’ll make sure the 2015 election will be the last under
first-past-the-post system.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
There’s another
election, and guess what? It’s being held under first-past-the-post. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Veterans: 
“Our plan
will give back to those who have given so much in service to all Canadians, and
will ensure that no veteran has to fight the government for the support and compensation
they have earned.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election Platform
Justin Trudeau
looked a military hero in the eye – a man who lost his leg fighting for our
country – and said that veterans are “asking for more than we are able to
give.” 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Accountability:

“We will
restore trust in our democracy.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election
Platform
Justin Trudeau
was the first Prime Minister in our country’s history to be found guilty of
breaking ethics laws, and he did it not once but twice! 
Justin Trudeau
has stonewalled the Ethics Commissioner, shut-down parliamentary committees
search for answers into Liberal corruption scandals, and he is now doing
everything in his power to block the RCMP from investigating his office. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Lower Taxes
for the Middle Class: 
“We will
give middle class Canadians a tax break.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015
Election Platform
Justin Trudeau
has raised taxes on 80 per cent of middle-class families, and his carbon tax
punishes everyday moms and dads driving their kids to hockey practice. 
If Justin
Trudeau is re-elected, his carbon tax is going to increase the price of
gasoline by 31 cents per litre.

Justin Trudeau is scheming up a plot to
cling to power by forming a coalition with the NDP. This is the coalition that
you cannot afford.

We know that the Trudeau-NDP Coalition will mean:
Higher taxes;Higher deficits;And, fewer good-paying jobs.
But, what exactly does it mean for you? We did the math.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has listed his five demands to be a part of the
coalition:
Wealth
TaxPharmacareUniversal
Dental CareAffordable
HousingRemoving
Interest from Federal Student Loans
When you combine these promises with the Liberal platform,
it will mean even bigger deficits and higher taxes.
The Liberal/NDP Coalition Deficits will average $34.7
billion over the next four years.

To pay just half of their deficits, the coalition would have to:
Raise the lowest personal income tax bracket from 15% to 19.5%Raise the GST from 5% to 7.5%Cut the Canada Health Transfer by 41%Cut the Canada Social Transfer by 100%

SEPTEMBER 29, 2019
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“This evening, at sundown,
the Jewish communities in Canada and around the world prepare to mark Rosh Hashanah
– the New Year- and the beginning of the High Holy Days.
“Rosh Hashanah is celebrated
on the first two days of the month of Tishrei, and marks the beginning of the
ten days of repentance during which Jews around the world will reflect on their
actions over the past year and seek forgiveness.
“As friends and families
share meals with sweet challah and apple slices dipped in honey, they will
reflect on renewal, and hope for an abundant year ahead.
“Canada has been blessed by
the strong presence of the Canadian Jewish community who enrich our country’s
culture and values of pluralism and freedom. As the Jewish community remains a
targeted group for hate-related offences, this Rosh Hashanah, let us recommit
ourselves to combating all forms of antisemitism and work together to educate
and to better our country.
“On behalf of the Canada’s
Conservatives, I extend my best wishes to the Jewish community, across Canada
and around the world, celebrating Rosh Hashanah and hope for a peaceful and
prosperous year ahead.

New Conservative government will work with provinces to break down trade barriers
In his first 100 days as Prime Minister,
Andrew Scheer will meet with Canada’s Premiers to establish a new
interprovincial free trade agreement that will create jobs and opportunities
for Canadians from coast to coast.
Scheer will host the meeting in Ottawa on January 6, 2020.
“Trade barriers between provinces mean Canadians are
missing out on so much opportunity and prosperity,” Scheer said. “As Prime
Minister, I will work with the provinces to get Canadian goods and services
moving across the country to put more money in Canadians’ pockets.”
Eliminating interprovincial trade barriers would improve
Canada’s competitiveness and productivity, potentially boosting Canada’s
economy by as much as $90 billion, according to the International Monetary
Fund.
In 2015, Justin Trudeau promised to usher in a new era of
provincial and territorial relations. Instead, he is pitting the provinces
against each other, forcing his carbon tax on provinces that have rejected it,
and picking fights with provincial leaders whose help he would need to keep his
election promises.
“Trudeau’s my-way-or-the-highway, Ottawa-knows-best
approach is costing Canadians,” Scheer said. “Canadians are working harder than
ever but just aren’t getting ahead, losing out on billions in trade and opportunity.
Only a new Conservative government will work with the provinces and territories
to create the kind of economic prosperity and opportunity that will put more
money in your pockets so you can get ahead.”
FACTS:
At this meeting, a new Conservative government will create a process to determine whether differences in laws and regulations unnecessarily prevent trade or whether they are reasonable exercises of provincial jurisdiction.While Canada has signed on to free-trade agreements with countries around the world, there are significant barriers to the free flow of goods and services within our own borders.Alberta Premier  that he would immediately remove 13 of 27 Jason Kenney recently announced     exemptions under the existing Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), and launch a review of the remaining 14.Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister also announced that effective immediately, the Manitoba government is removing a number of its exemptions under the CFTA to further reduce interprovincial trade barriers.To increase opportunities for Canadians to work anywhere in Canada, a new Conservative government will expand the Red Seal Program to recognize common credentials. We will work with the provinces and territories to harmonize apprenticeship training and trade certification in their jurisdictions.

ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET
AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit,      saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit,      allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax      Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and      learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit,      putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians for green home improvements.

In the face of scandal, Trudeau reveals platform, making billions in farcical promises to Canadians  
In
an attempt to cover up international embarrassment, Justin Trudeau has revealed
his platform, announcing a staggering $57 billion in campaign promises. The
tally of his disastrous campaign is mounting, and so is his debt. 
“Justin
Trudeau will do or say anything to get re-elected. If given four more years, we
know that Trudeau is going to raise your taxes to pay for his out of control
spending,” said Pierre Poilievre, MP Carleton at a media availability in
Ottawa.
To
reveal the true cost of Justin Trudeau’s poor judgement, the Conservative Party
has once again done the math:
Justin
Trudeau’s campaign promises added to his existing deficits will pile on $100
billion of new debt to the books; His
deficit will hit $27.4 billion in 2020; and, Total
debt by the end of Justin Trudeau’s second term would be over $800 billion.  
What
does that mean for you? Justin Trudeau’s never-ending spending will threaten
the quality of our health and social programs. He will be forced to raise taxes
to pay for his endless debt and deficits. 
To
pay just half of Justin Trudeau’s deficits ($14B), he would have to either:
Raise
the GST by 2% or; Raise
the rate on the first income tax bracket from 15% to 19% or;Raise
the rate on the second income tax bracket from 20.5% to 27% or; Lower
the basic personal amount from $12,069 to $6,869. 
Further,
by reaching $823 billion in total debt, Trudeau is will spend $35 billion on
interest payments alone. That’s $35 billion that will not go to Canadians’
priorities.
Justin
Trudeau campaigned on a promise to help the middle class. Instead, he raised
taxes on 80 per cent of middle-class Canadians and imposed a carbon tax that
makes everyday essential more expensive. If Justin Trudeau is re-elected, his
carbon tax is going to increase the price of gasoline by 31 cents per litre. 
“This
election will come down to the choice between a government who thinks they can
spend your money better than you, raises taxes, and makes your life more
unaffordable – and a new Conservative government that will lower your taxes and
put more money in your pocket,” said Poilievre. 
JUSTIN
TRUDEAU’S BROKEN PROMISES:

Budgets: 
“I

A new Conservative government will work with provinces and territories to protect waters
Conservative candidate for Richmond-Arthabaska Alain Rayes was joined by Robert Coutu, candidate for La Pointe-de-l’île, and spoke at Parc de l’hôtel de ville about Canada’s Conservative’s plan to protect our waters. A new Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer will work with the provinces and municipalities to put an end to raw sewage being dumped in waterways across Canada. 
“Our waterways should not be used as a toxic dumping ground and it’s
our responsibility to protect these vital natural assets for future generations
to enjoy,” said Rayes. “In one of her first acts as environment minister,
Catherine McKenna gave the go-ahead to the City of Montreal to dump eight
billion litres of raw sewage into one of Canada’s most iconic waterways, the
Saint Lawrence River. It’s disgusting and it’s wrong. We will help put an end
to it.”
Eight billion litres is the equivalent of 3,200 Olympic-sized
swimming pools.
In
2017 alone, municipalities dumped 215 billion litres of raw sewage untreated
into lakes and rivers across the country. 
“Since taking office, Justin Trudeau has failed to protect our waterways
from pollution,” said Rayes. “This is not acceptable. Trudeau is putting the
biodiversity values of our land, waterways, and marine environments at risk.”
When it comes to the environment, Justin
Trudeau makes big promises and then fails to deliver. He claims his government
is on track to reduce
Canada’s emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 but reports by his own
government say he’s not even close. When it comes to protecting our
environment, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. 
Canada’s Conservatives have a proud legacy when it comes to
managing Canada’s natural environment and improving Canada’s environmental
performance. A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment builds on
this proud legacy andwill further
lower Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen environmental
protections, with the core Conservative
promise to put more money in Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead.
FACTS:
Since coming to
power, Justin Trudeau has done nothing to tackle this problem. He continues to
use our waterways as a dumping ground for toxic waste.In 2007, the
previous Conservative government implemented the Lake Simcoe Clean-Up Fund. It
funded over 200 community-based projects that restored fish and wildlife
populations, planted thousands of new trees, and reduced harmful sewage and
waste dumps into watersheds. The Trudeau Liberals cancelled the fund in 2017. The previous Conservative
government had an excellent track record on waste management. We created the
Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations to set higher standards for wastewater
treatment, and made wastewater investments across the country.Canada’s Conservatives
recognize the global environmental impact of climate change. That is why we

emissions, built on three guiding principles: Green Technology, Not TaxesA Cleaner and Greener Natural Environment Taking the Climate Change Fight Global

Conservative plan takes real action to fight crime vs. Trudeau’s do-nothing gun ban
A new Conservative government will take real
action to fight gang and gun violence, combat human trafficking, and tackle
drug addictions and recovery, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced
today.
“As Prime Minister, I will lead a government that
honours its most sacred duty – to keep its citizens and their streets safe,”
Scheer said. “Justin Trudeau has failed in this regard and all of his proposed
measures to fight crime simply will not work. Canadians can’t trust him to keep
them safe.”  
The Conservative plan for safer streets targets
illegal firearms crossing the border and ending up with gangsters, while
strengthening penalties to keep gang and gun criminals behind bars.  
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer’s plan for A
Safer Canada will: 
End automatic bail
for gang members awaiting trial and revoke parole for any gang member who
associates with their former gang following release.
Identify known
gangs as criminal entities in the Criminal Code, similar to how terrorist
organizations are currently listed.
Bring in tougher
sentences, including a five-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for violent
gang crime, with a new five-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for
possession of a smuggled firearm. 
Create a Canada
Border Services Agency firearms smuggling task force to intercept illegal
firearms at the Canada-US border.
Strengthen
background checks for gun licenses and make it a crime to provide a firearm to
anyone who has been prohibited from owning them. 
Revise the
Canadian drugs and substance strategy to focus on helping Canadians recover
from addiction.
Strengthen human trafficking laws, including consecutive sentences for
those who are convicted on multiple counts of human trafficking and ensuring
Canada meets our commitments under the Palermo Protocol. 
Scheer contrasted the detailed Conservative plan
with Trudeau’s vague firearms ban that will do nothing to crack down on gun
crime.
“Forcing law-abiding Canadians to follow even
more laws will not reduce crime,” Scheer said. “Criminals don’t follow laws and
that’s exactly why we have to target them. My plan does the hard work of
tracking down criminals and putting them behind bars where they belong so you
and your family can be safe and get ahead.”

New Conservative government to repeal Trudeau tax increases and reduce red tape
Small
business owners can look forward to a new Conservative government repealing
Justin Trudeau’s tax increases and cutting red tape, announced Andrew Scheer at
Cracker Jack’s Bar and Grill today. 
“Justin
Trudeau thinks small businesses are tax cheats, “said Scheer. “In the last four
years, it has become more expensive than ever to run a business. Trudeau’s
Carbon Tax raised the price of gasoline and heating, making it harder to pay
monthly bills. His payroll tax hikes hurt the bottom line, and his
unprecedented tax hike on small businesses in 2017 – although Canada’s
Conservatives and business leaders came together to try to stop it – ended up
costing small businesses even more.”

make a living and grow their business.

only are small businesses victim to the Trudeau government’s tax hikes, small
businesses across the country are also struggling under a massive regulatory
burden. Justin Trudeau has imposed more than 4,300 job-killing, growth-choking
federal regulations on Canadian business since 2015. 
A
new Conservative government will take several measures to support our small
businesses: 
Repeal
Trudeau’s tax increases on small business investments Exempt
spouses from Trudeau’s tax increases on small business dividends Make
it easier to navigate Canada’s tax system and the Canada Revenue AgencyReduce
federal regulations by 25 per centImplement
a 2-for-1 rule for new regulations Assign
a Minister reporting directly to the Prime Minister to lead red tape reduction
effortsMandate
ministers and regulators to support innovation, economic growth, and global
competitiveness Champion
Canada’s small businesses to the world  
“A
new Conservative government will continue to celebrate small businesses as
drivers of prosperity, and not view them merely as sources of revenue,” said
Scheer. “It’s time to stop Justin Trudeau’s attacks on small business owners.
It is time for Canada’s small businesses to get ahead.”
FACTS:
Of
the 95,000 businesses that are created in Canada each year, barely 50 per cent
will survive to celebrate their tenth anniversary. Over the last four years, it
has become more difficult than ever to start and grow a business.In
2017, Trudeau proposed a disastrous set of small business tax increases that
were only partially abandoned because of effective pressure by Canada’s
Conservatives and massive public outcry.Trudeau
tried to hike taxes on small businesses’ investment income to 73 per cent, and
then went after small business owners’ spouses, ending a long-standing tax
exemption on dividend payments. The
Canadian Chamber of Commerce (CCC) reports there were 131,754 federal regulations
on the books when Justin Trudeau took office in 2015. Public policy think-tank
MEI reports that by 2018, the number of federal
regulations rose to 136,121 – an increase of more than 4,300.In
late 2018, the Financial Post reported that regulatory burden was
“killing Canada’s competitiveness.”

OCTOBER 8, 2019
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, today released the following statement on Yom Kippur:
“This evening at sundown, the Jewish community in Canada and around the world will join together to mark the beginning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.
“Yom Kippur, marks the end of the High Holy Days. It is a time to focus on repentance and to atone for the sins of the past year. This day of fasting will begin with the Kol Nidrei service, marking the start of a period of reflection, seeking forgiveness for wrong-doings and looking ahead to starting the New Year with a clean slate.
“The Jewish community across Canada has played an integral role in all areas of Canadian society. Today, Canada is home to one of the largest and most engaged Jewish populations in the world. On this day, I hope that Canadians take the opportunity to recognize our common values and the immense contributions made by the Jewish community in shaping a more peaceful and prosperous Canada.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend our warmest wishes to the Jewish community here at home and around the world as they observe this sacred fast day.

A new Conservative government will prioritize critical
infrastructure projects that shorten commute times like the George Massey
Tunnel replacement in the Greater Vancouver Area, Conservative Leader Andrew
Scheer announced today.
“Canadians are sick and tired of being stuck in traffic and
waiting for delayed public transit,” said Scheer. “Canada’s Conservatives will
get on with real projects that reduce congestion and deliver faster commute
times for everyone, whether you drive or catch public transit.”
Examples of the type of projects that would be prioritized for
funding include:
The George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project (British Columbia)The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension (Ontario)The third link between Quebec City and Levis (Québec)
Scheer pointed out how, despite making a $187-billion
infrastructure spending commitment in the 2015 election, Justin Trudeau has
failed to deliver important projects for Canadian commuters.
“He’s made billions in promises but hasn’t delivered. When it
comes to getting shovels in the ground and getting projects built, Justin
Trudeau is not as advertised,” Scheer said.
A new Conservative government will also restore transparency to
infrastructure spending by scrapping Justin Trudeau’s $35-billion Infrastructure
Bank which has been nothing but a waste of taxpayer dollars, adding countless
layers of red tape, delaying desperately needed transportation infrastructure,
and doing nothing to decrease commute times.
Scheer added, “As Prime Minister, I will ensure that all
infrastructure projects that have already been committed to will move forward. Going
forward, a new Conservative government will have a strategy in place to prioritize
future transportation projects on whether they lower commute times and also provide
more housing options for Canadians.”
FACTS:
Statistics Canada found that 1.5
million Canadians spent at least an hour commuting to work in 2016.According to the Parliamentary
Budget Officer (PBO), for every dollar
Justin Trudeau promised for infrastructure, he only spent 60 cents: “the
Government failed to spend about 40 per cent of its planned infrastructure
budget.” Analysis
showed that for all his spending, there are no substantial results to show for
it.In its analysis of Budget 2018,
the PBO reported:
“Budget 2018 provides an incomplete account of the changes to the Government’s
$186.7 billion infrastructure spending plan. PBO requested the new plan but it
does not exist.”If given four more years,
Justin Trudeau’s debt and never-ending deficits will delay badly needed
infrastructure, threatening the future of important projects like the George
Massey Tunnel replacement.

A new Conservative government will bring back the Hunting and Angling Advisory 
Michelle
Rempel, Conservative candidate for Calgary Nose Hill, spoke
today in Calgary about the Conservatives’ plan to give hunters and anglers a
voice in protecting Canada’s natural habitats by re-establishing the Hunting
and Angling Advisory Panel.
“The Trudeau Liberals cut the Hunting and
Angling Advisory Panel and chose to lose touch with what is happening in our
local communities,” said Rempel. “Canada’s hunters and anglers make significant
contributions to the preservation of species and habitats and can offer
valuable advice on the stewardship of Canada’s wildlife.”
“Justin
Trudeau and his Liberal team have ignored much of the important work that is
being done in local communities to protect, conserve, and manage our
environment due to their “Ottawa knows best” approach,” said Rempel. 
In A Real Plan to Protect our Environment, restoring the Hunting and Angling Advisory Panel is just one of many initiatives focused on increasing community involvement and positioning the government alongside Canadians to work together to promote a cleaner and greener natural environment. There are so many Canadians who work diligently to fight climate change and protect our environment. Canada’s Conservatives want to make sure that your voice is heard, that you have a seat at the table, and that the government is working with you.

Yesterday the Conservative Party received
notice from lawyers representing the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
informing us they would be suing over the use of news clips in a Conservative
Party social media video.
The Conservative Party has grave concern that this decision was made on the eve of an election that CBC is to be covering fairly and objectively. The Conservative Party considers this a complete distraction in the final days of a tightly contested election, and we will dispute this lawsuit fully.
The video in question was removed from our platforms well
before CBC lawyers made the decision to file their lawsuit.
The 17 seconds of CBC clips in the video included Andrew
Coyne highlighting how Justin Trudeau broke the law, Justin Trudeau telling a
Canadian war veteran that he is “asking for more than we can give right now”,
and one CBC reporter questioning why the Liberals provided Loblaws with $12
million in tax dollars to install new refrigerators.
CBC is a taxpayer-funded entity, tasked with covering this
election fairly and objectively. Canadians pay the funding CBC receives.
Canadians pay the salaries for those employed at CBC. Simply, Canadians own
CBC.
When you are funded entirely by taxpayer dollars,
taxpayers should be able to use the footage.
The Copyright Act provides for fair dealing.
Elections Canada provided further clarification on a
September 11th posting to their website, namely:
Question 35. Can a political ad contain a “news clip” without the approval of the broadcaster? Answer:  Prior to the election period, broadcasters can decline to run a political ad on any grounds they choose, provided they treat all parties on an equitable basis.  However, during the election period, they are not entitled to decline an ad unless the broadcast would be in contravention of the law.  If a news clip is relatively short and is not a substantial part of the audiovisual work from which it was taken, the broadcast of the news clip in a political ad would not infringe the copyright of the owner of the audiovisual work and would not require the permission of that owner to be broadcast.
Instead, CBC is using taxpayer dollars to sue a major
political party ten days before a national election in this country.

On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, Mike
Lake candidate for Edmonton – Wetaskiwin released the following statement:
“There is an estimated 1 in 66 Canadians aged 5 to 17 who
are diagnosed with autism. Across Canada, families work tirelessly to support
their children and care for their loved ones. Evidence-based therapies and
services can cost up to $80,000 per year for children with high needs. The
financial costs added to missed work, drives to appointments, and late nights
all add up.
“At present, across the country, provinces and territories
struggle to meet the growing needs of the autism community. There are
jurisdictional inequalities in service deliveries that force families to move
or seek services away from home.
“Canada’s Conservatives believe that the federal
government can play an important role in developing a strategy to assist those
living with autism and their families. As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will
work with autism stakeholders to develop a National Autism Strategy.
“An initial investment of $50 million over five years
would be invested to develop a comprehensive strategy in consultation with
autistic individuals, autism organizations, provincial, territorial, and
municipal governments, and indigenous communities. The National Autism Strategy
will be person-centred, include first-person perspectives, will be culturally
appropriate, and will reflect the needs of Canada’s northern, rural, and remote
communities.
“This is an important first step to support Canadians’
access to meaningful support and resources to live to their full potential, no
matter where they live.
“A new Conservative government will work together with
autism organizations across Canada, and the greater autism community to address
the needs of the autism community so they can live their best life possible.”

Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act could help 35,000 more Canadians with disabilities
A new Conservative government will introduce the Fairness for
Persons with Disabilities Act, allowing 35,000 more Canadians to qualify and
apply for the Disability Tax Credit, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today. 
This new Act will reduce the number of hours spent per week on
life-sustaining therapy needed to qualify for the credit from 14 to 10. It will
also expand the definition of what counts as life-sustaining therapy to include
determining dosages of medical food and activities related to determining dosages
of medication, including dietary or exercise regimes. This would allow 35,000
more Canadians with disabilities the potential to access savings of an average
of $2,100 a year.
“A new Conservative government will support Canadians with
disabilities in ways that leave more money in their pockets to help them manage
their health needs,” Scheer said. “We will make sure that Canadians with a
disability can care for themselves and parents of children with disabilities can
support their children without worrying about their bottom line.”
Under our policy, a Canadian with type
1 diabetes who currently spends an average of 10 hours per week managing his or
her condition would qualify for the Disability Tax Credit.
In 2017, Justin Trudeau changed how Canadians qualify for the
Disability Tax Credit and the Registered Disability Savings Plan, stripping
important financial support from thousands of Canadians with disabilities.
“Trudeau
has made life more expensive for all Canadians, including those with
disabilities,” Scheer said. “A new Conservative government will live within its
means. We will lower your taxes and put more money in your pocket so you can worry
less about your bottom line and focus on living life to your full potential.” 
Conservative MP Tom Kmiec introduced the Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act in 2018 but the bill did
not pass before parliament was dissolved.

New Conservative government to bring
real accountability and transparency to government 
A new
Conservative government will introduce legislation to attach stiff penalties
for violating ethics laws and strengthen the powers of parliamentary watchdogs
during its first 100 days, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
Scheer said he
will establish penalties for violations of the Conflict of Interest Act that do not currently carry penalties. The
penalties will be proportional to the severity of the violation and the
seniority of the offender and they will carry a maximum fine of $20,000. This
includes the sections of the Act that
deal with conflict of interest, preferential treatment, insider information, influence,
accepting gifts and other violations. 
“When you break
ethics laws, as Justin Trudeau has done twice, there should be real
consequences,” Scheer said. “As Prime Minister, I will make sure politicians
who break the law to benefit themselves and their friends will pay a heavy
price.”
When Finance
Minister Bill Morneau failed to disclose his villa in France to the Ethics
Commissioner, he was only forced to pay a fine of $200. 
When Justin
Trudeau was found guilty of violating the Conflict
of Interest Act for accepting a free vacation to the Aga Khan’s private
island and for interfering in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, there were
no penalties at all.
“Canadians
expect accountability when their leaders violate the law and violate their
trust and that’s what I will deliver,” Scheer said.
Currently, the
maximum fine for breaching the Conflict
of Interest Act is five hundred dollars, and only applies when public
office holders fail to meet reporting requirements. 
A new Conservative government will also restore accountability and
transparency in government by:
Increasing oversight powers of the Ethics
Commissioner and Lobbying Commissioner Strengthening lobbying restrictions Closing the loophole in the Conflict of Interest
Act that allows the indirect holding of shares by Cabinet ministersIntroducing legislative reforms for whistleblowers 
Scheer has already announced he will hold a judicial inquiry into the
SNC-Lavalin scandal and pass the No More
Cover Ups Act, which will prevent corrupt politicians from using Cabinet
confidence to cover up their scandals.
“In 2015,
Justin Trudeau promised he would be ethical and accountable. Every day since
then, he has proven that he is not as advertised,” Scheer said. “Time and time
again, he and his Ministers have abused the power of their office for their own
personal gain. A Prime Minister who so willingly deceives and breaks the law
simply cannot be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of governing
for Canada.”
On October 21, Canadians
have a choice between Justin Trudeau who abuses his power, bends the law for
his friends, attempts to silence his critics and destroys their reputations – and
a Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer who will uphold the rule of law,
respect our democratic institutions, and help all Canadians get ahead.
FACTS: 
The
Conflict of Interest Act was
introduced by the previous Conservative government through the Federal Accountability Act, replacing
the Conflict of Interest and
Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders.Currently
Canada’s Conflict of Interest Act “does not provide for any sanctions
for breaches found following an examination by the conflict of interest and
ethics commissioner.”The
only penalties the Ethics Commissioner has the power to impose under the Act are “administrative monetary
penalties,” which only apply when public office holders fail to meet
reporting requirements.

Yesterday Postmedia exposed numerous sexist
comments by Justin Trudeau’s handpicked candidate in Sydney-Victoria, Jamie

While some of Battiste’s comments are too inappropriate to
repeat, he joked about sexually assaulting women and believes their role is to
clean, cook and fold laundry.
These comments are disgusting and inexcusable. An
individual who makes this many disparaging comments is not worthy of sitting in

“Despite these sexist comments, Battiste is allowed to run
as a Liberal candidate for Justin Trudeau,” said Lisa Raitt, Conservative

groping a journalist in British Columbia, or throwing strong women out of his

Ottawa, Ontario – The media are reporting that a whistleblower was let go by a Trudeau cabinet minister after the whistleblower tried to flag concerns about a conflict of interest. According to the media, the Liberal Government appointed Moreen Miller as the new Chair of the of Defence Construction Canada (DCC). The only problem is that Ms. Miller continued her role as President of Fowler, a firm that bids on DCC contracts.  Only now, after once again being exposed, the Government was forced to order an ‘urgent’ investigation into the file. This, on the eve of an election.  This is a pattern. First Vice-Admiral Mark Norman was thrown under the bus for raising concerns about the Trudeau government’s unethical behaviour. Then Jody-Wilson Raybould was fired for raising concerns about the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.  Now a third whistleblower has been let go for flagging a conflict of interest.  It’s obvious that there are one set of rules for Trudeau and his friends, and another set of rules for the rest of us.  Justin Trudeau cannot be trusted and if he is re-elected he will continue to break laws and grant insider access to Liberals and corporate lobbyists.  Under Prime Minister Andrew Scheer the corruption in Ottawa will end. It starts with a judicial inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal and introducing the No More Cover Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access information protected by cabinet confidence.

Justin Trudeau will pay any price to hold

The 2008 coalition, like the coalition Trudeau refuses to
rule out with Jagmeet Singh, would have led to economic disaster in Canada with
skyrocketing taxes and mass unemployment. 
Canadians cannot trust Justin Trudeau. If he won’t rule
out a coalition with the NDP, it’s because he has a secret plan to do it when
he is defeated. If Trudeau has no plan to join a coalition, why won’t he simply
say it? 
Trudeau is already promising higher taxes and bigger
deficits if he’s re-elected. Imagine how much more you will pay with Trudeau
held hostage by the NDP.
The NDP’s price for propping up Trudeau will be even
higher taxes, more reckless spending, fewer jobs, bigger deficits, and more
debt.
The choice is clear. A Liberal-NDP coalition that will
cost you thousands of dollars more, or a Conservative government that will live
within its means and put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released three new TV ads to highlight that a re-elected Liberal government will continue to take decisive action to fight the climate crisis.
“In October, you get to choose. We can go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change – or fight for a better future,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, in one of the new ads. “I’m for moving forward for everyone. It’s that clear – and it’s that important. The future of our planet is at stake.”
The ads launch comes at the start of Global Climate Action Week. In the coming days, we will announce further ambitious action to combat the climate crisis – the defining global issue of our time. The science is clear, the evidence is clear, and Canadians are clear – we must step up and protect our environment. Our kids and grandkids are counting on us.
Over the last four years, the Liberal government took significant action to protect our environment for generations to come, including:

putting a price on the pollution that causes climate change;
banning harmful single-use plastics;
protecting nearly 14 per cent of Canada’s coasts and marine areas;
building 1,200 public transit projects across the country;
making zero-emission vehicles more accessible and affordable;
investing in energy efficiency to help families and businesses save money;
committing to phase out coal power by 2030, and investing in renewables like wind and solar;
safeguarding our oceans and coasts with our historic Oceans Protection Plan; and
making the largest conservation investments in Canadian history.

“A better future doesn’t just happen. We make it happen,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Andrew Scheer doesn’t think it’s possible to grow the economy and fight climate change. He’s wrong. Our plan will create jobs, reduce pollution, and leave a healthier planet for our kids and grandkids.”

Ottawa, ON — A re-elected Liberal government will immediately commit Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050, and will help workers prepare for the clean energy transition.
Today, Liberal candidates Catherine McKenna, Jonathan Wilkinson, and Steven Guilbeault announced that a re-elected Liberal government would immediately commit Canada to achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century, joining 65 other countries and the European Union that made the pledge at the United Nations Climate Summit on Monday. Net-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but these emissions would be offset by other actions — such as planting trees.
“The planet is burning and people are taking to the streets to demand stronger action to fight climate change,” said Liberal candidate from Laurier—Sainte-Marie, Steven Guilbeault. “The science is clear, the evidence is clear and Canadians are clear — we must step up and do even more to protect our environment. Our kids and grandkids are counting on us.”
That’s why a re-elected Liberal government will take concrete steps to lower emissions and make life more affordable for Canadians.

We will set legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to reach net-zero emissions by 2050;
We will appoint a group of scientists, economists, and experts to recommend the best path to get to net-zero;
We will exceed Canada’s 2030 emissions goal; and
We will ensure energy workers and communities can shape their own futures by introducing a Just Transition Act, giving workers access to the training, support, and new opportunities needed to succeed in the future economy.

“It is time for Canada to join governments and leading businesses around the world that have committed to net zero emissions by 2050 in order to further tackle the worsening climate crisis,” said Liberal candidate from Ottawa-Centre, Catherine McKenna. “We know that the strongest economies and businesses in the future will be those that embrace clean technologies. We will ensure that all Canadian workers are part of this transition to a cleaner, more prosperous and more sustainable future.”
These commitments build on the Liberals’ climate record that already includes over 50 measures to cut pollution and protect our environment. These include:

Banning harmful single-use plastics and microbeads;
Phasing out coal power by 2030 and investing in renewables like wind and solar;
Putting a price on carbon pollution so it’s no longer free to pollute anywhere in Canada, while putting more money back into Canadians’ pockets;
Building 1,200 public transit projects across the country;
Making zero-emission vehicles more accessible and affordable; and
Investing in energy efficiency to help families and businesses save money.

“Climate change represents an existential threat, but also an economic opportunity for countries that foster technologies that address greenhouse gas emissions,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, the Liberal candidate for North Vancouver. “We are committed to addressing this threat. Andrew Scheer, on the other hand, will do less and cost Canadians more in a plan that experts say will increase carbon pollution. We must do better.”

Toronto, ON — Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new set of ads reminding Canadians that when the Conservatives were last in office, they made life harder for seniors and older Canadians looking forward to retirement.
When Stephen Harper’s Conservatives raised the age of retirement, it took thousands of dollars away from seniors — forcing them to work longer, and preventing them from spending time with their families. Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are the same. He voted against lowering the age of retirement back to 65, and his party pledged to reverse the changes we made to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan.
“Whenever the Conservatives cut taxes, they cut them for the wealthy — and in this election, it’s no different,” says Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, in one of the new ads. “I just don’t think that’s right. I’m for moving forward, for everyone.”
To help older Canadians save more money and retire with confidence, the Liberals have:

Lowered the retirement age back to 65;
Made the most significant enhancement to the Canada Pension Plan since its creation;
Increased Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement;
Lifted 50,000 seniors out of poverty;
Promised to lift another 20,000 seniors out of poverty by increasing Old Age Security again when seniors turn 75; and
Promised to give up to $2,080 in additional benefits, every year, to those who’ve lost a loved one by increasing survivor’s benefits.

Along with giving more support to seniors, a re-elected Liberal government will also lower taxes for the middle class and make life more affordable for those who need a break — not for the wealthiest one per cent.
“The Conservative approach gives tax breaks to millionaires,” continues Mr. Trudeau in one of the ads. “We believe in helping those who need it most: middle class Canadians and those working hard to join them.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Small Business Week, which runs from October 20 to 26, 2019:
“On Small Business Week, we celebrate the local business owners and entrepreneurs who make our country such a great place to live.
Small and medium sized businesses grow our economy, create jobs, and help Canada thrive. Behind every small business is an entrepreneur – dedicated Canadians who dream big, work hard, and move our country forward. In the last four years, they’ve helped push unemployment to historic lows and create over a million new jobs for Canadians. From mom & pop shops to small home-based startups to growing mid-sized companies, Canada’s entrepreneurs are the backbone of our economy and our communities.
That’s why our Liberal government has worked hard every day to help our entrepreneurs get ahead. From reducing the small business tax rate to the lowest in the G7, to helping more people start their own business with the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, our Liberal government has made supporting small businesses a top priority. From CETA to the CPTPP, we signed a record number of trade deals, helping our businesses compete in markets around the world. We stood firm during the NAFTA renegotiations, to defend our trade relationship with Canada’s largest trading partner. And when Conservatives wanted to make concessions and settle for less, we fought – and won – to protect Canadian jobs and get a good deal for our workers and the many businesses throughout the supply chain that employ them.
We still have work to do. Today, nearly one in five entrepreneurs say it’s still a challenge to get the financing they need from traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions. To help more Canadians start and grow a business, a re-elected Liberal government will create the Canada Entrepreneur Account, administered through the Business Development Bank of Canada, to provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs with as much as $50,000 each year to launch their new businesses.
To make it easier for our small and medium-sized businesses to succeed, we’ll cut the cost of federal incorporation by 75 per cent, eliminate all fees from certain business advisory services, and eliminate the “swipe fee” on HST and GST for credit transactions – which will save businesses nearly $500 million a year in fees. And to help small businesses reach new customers around the world, we will make sure every Canadian business has access to reliable, high-speed internet by 2030, including in rural, remote, and northern communities.
In the last four years, Canada’s entrepreneurs and business owners have built a strong economy and laid the foundation for a better future. And this progress has been possible because our Liberal government rejected Conservative cuts and austerity – and chose instead to invest in the middle class and people working hard to join it. Tomorrow, Canadians will have a choice to make, and that choice couldn’t be more clear: go backwards with cuts to services and support, or choose forward together for a more prosperous future. Let’s do something small business owners do every day – roll up our sleeves and move forward.”

Gatineau, QC – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new ad highlighting how a re-elected Liberal government will move forward with Quebecers and all Canadians to build a better future.
“We want to move forward,” says one woman featured in the new ad.
“We want a country that protects a woman’s right to choose,” other participants say. “We want a country that puts the environment first, that invests in public transit. A country that helps families and lowers our taxes.”
In less than two weeks, Canadians will make a choice about the future of our country. That choice could not be more clear. Do we:

Protect a woman’s right to choose, or roll back the progress we’ve made on gender equality?
Fight the climate crisis with a serious plan, or leave the problem to our kids and grandkids?
Invest in families, or let the Conservatives cut everything we care about?
Keep cutting taxes for the middle class, or give tax breaks to big polluters and the wealthiest one percent?

A re-elected Liberal government will keep moving forward to make life more affordable for Canadians. Our plan will help people:

Save nearly $600 a year, per family, thanks to our tax cut that helps the middle class, not the richest one percent;
Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by ten per cent once they turn 75, increasing by up to $729 each year;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments if they’re buying their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save on medications their family needs when we implement Universal Pharmacare;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care by ten percent;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and get 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

“Over the last four years, we’ve put Canada on the path of progress. And we’re not stopping now,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, in the ad. “On October 21st, I’m choosing forward – for everyone.”

Toronto, ON — Today, the Liberal Party of Canada unveiled its plan to move forward for a stronger middle class, and for a better Canada for all Canadians.
“Middle class Canadians do the heavy lifting in our economy,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “So when we choose to give more help to the middle class and the people working hard to join it, we are choosing a stronger economy. We are choosing a more affordable, more fair Canada. We are choosing a cleaner, better country for our kids and grandkids. We are choosing forward.”
Forward: A Real Plan for the Middle Class builds on the progress we’ve made investing in families, workers, and communities. Under our plan, we will cut taxes for the middle class, without giving a break to millionaires. We will ban assault rifles and strengthen gun control. And we will continue to take bold action to protect our environment and fight climate change.
“The Conservatives want to go back to the Harper years, where they give tax cuts to millionaires, loosen gun regulations, and make it free to pollute again,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Andrew Scheer doesn’t think it’s possible to grow the economy and fight climate change. He’s wrong. Our plan will create jobs, reduce pollution, and leave a healthier planet for our kids and grandkids.”
When a Liberal government is re-elected, the average family in Canada will also:

Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
Save nearly $600 a year when we lower taxes for everyone but the already wealthy;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by at least $729 when they turn 75;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments on their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

Forward: A Real Plan for the Middle Class also gives real help to the next generation of Canadian leaders. The costs of tuition, rent, books, and groceries — along with cuts to student aid by provincial Conservative governments — are putting an immense amount of pressure and stress on students.
A re-elected Liberal government will help more students prepare for good jobs while taking on less debt.

We will give students up to $1,200 more, per year, by increasing Canada Student Grants by another 40 per cent, to help with the rising cost of tuition, books, and rent; and
We will give students two years after graduation to get started before they need to begin paying off their student loans, interest free.
We will change the rules so that, even after the two year grace period, graduates won’t have to start repaying their loans until they make at least $35,000, and can put their loans on hold if their income drops below this level; and
We will allow parents to pause student loan repayments — with no interest — until their youngest child reaches the age of five. This means more money to help pay for things like baby products and child care in those important, and expensive, first years.

“Like Doug Ford, Andrew Scheer will cut support for college and university students. But what the Conservatives fail to understand is that the greatest investment we can make in our future is in education and training,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We won’t make the same mistakes. On education. On the environment. On the economy. We will not fall back and fall behind. We will move forward, and choose to lead.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day of Democracy:
“In every election, we get to make a choice about the future of our country. We get to decide what we want to achieve, and who we want to be as Canadians. As members of a democracy, this is our right and our responsibility. All of us can directly shape the future we want to see – for our families, our communities, and all our fellow Canadians.
“On the International Day of Democracy, we celebrate the democratic tradition that empowers us all and keeps Canada moving forward.
“Yet around the world, in 2019, democracy is increasingly under attack. And in recent years, we’ve seen an assault on journalists and the free press – the beating heart of democracy worldwide.
“It’s up to all of us to not only safeguard our democracy, but to strengthen it. That means using our vote to make our voices heard – but casting our ballot is just the beginning. From taking part in a town hall meeting, to helping our kids learn how their government works, we build our democracy together every day. The smallest of actions count.
“This fall, Canadians will once again get to vote for the kind of Canada they want to live in. While some politicians threaten to pull us backward, Canadians will have the choice to keep moving forward. We have spent the last four years building toward better. Now, we have the chance to continue that progress, together.
“Today, I urge Canadians to celebrate the power and responsibility we have – thanks to our democracy – to shape our country and our world. Let’s make the most of it, stand united, and choose forward – for all of us.”

Papineau, QC – With eight weeks until Canadians head to the polls, Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada are launching an innovative new advertising and digital engagement campaign focused on the choice facing Canadians in October’s important election.
A series of new national ads featuring Justin Trudeau will begin airing on television this week, as part of a comprehensive and digitally-integrated advertising experience that also includes a large-scale online campaign, a new website, and featured stories from Canadians who have a personal connection to Canada’s progress since 2015. It also includes the launch of the Liberal Party of Canada’s official 2019 campaign theme: Choose Forward.
“The Conservatives like to say they’re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else,” says Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. “In October, we’ve got a choice to make: Keep moving forward and build on the progress we’ve made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years. I’m for moving forward — for everyone.”
Justin Trudeau highlights how Conservative politicians have consistently opposed the Liberal government’s progress to help people, including:

Raising taxes on the wealthiest one percent, so we could lower taxes for the middle class
Creating the Canada Child Benefit, which gives hundreds of dollars each month tax-free to families across Canada
A real plan to fight climate change that will reduce pollution and put more money in Canadians’ pockets

Canadians will have an important choice to make in this fall’s election. While Conservatives are focused on going backward with cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class.

Ottawa, ON – The Liberal Party of Canada has achieved a record-breaking third quarter for support from grassroots donors, with a new Q3 high of 53,341 Canadians chipping in $7,276, 261 to support Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team’s plan to invest in the middle class.
“In the Q3 that led into the 2019 general election, more Canadians than ever before chipped in to support Justin Trudeau and hardworking Liberal volunteers and campaigns across Canada,” said Azam Ishmael, National Director of the Liberal Party of Canada. “On October 21, Canadians sent the Liberal team back to Ottawa with a mandate to make life more affordable, to continue to fight climate change, and get guns off our streets. We’ve made real progress for Canadians over these past four years, and working together, there’s much more to do.”
The median donation to the Liberal Party in Q3 was just $20 at a time, and 93 percent of all donations were under $200. There are also now more active monthly grassroots donors to the Liberal Party of Canada than at any other time in the party’s history, building on the continued success of local EDAs out-fundraising their Conservative counterparts at a margin of nearly 2-to-1.
Filings with Elections Canada also continue to highlight that Liberal supporters are getting far more value for their donations than Conservatives. Annual returns since 2015 show that the Conservative Party spent $22,519,872 on fundraising expenses throughout 2016-2018, while the Liberal Party spent just $9,254,606.
Q3 filings from all parties will be available on Elections Canada’s website at Elections.ca
The Liberal Party of Canada’s successful re-election campaign also saw the party’s largest-ever volunteer mobilization and digital engagement programs. Tens of thousands of Liberal volunteers made more than 21 million knocks and calls before and during the campaign to start new conversations with Canadians about building a better future.

Trois-Rivières, QC — A re-elected Liberal government will make it easier and more affordable for hard-working Canadians to start and grow their own businesses.
Right now, seven out of every ten Canadians work for small and medium-sized businesses — making them Canada’s largest employers and drivers of our economy. Yet for too many entrepreneurs, the costs of doing business is a barrier.
“After a decade of stalled economic growth and unemployment under the Conservatives, Canada’s economy has rebounded — largely thanks to the hard work of Canadians who started their own businesses,” said Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “To keep that momentum moving forward, we cut the small business tax rate and now we’re making it possible for anyone with a good idea and a passion for what they do to start their own business and support their communities.”
In addition to cutting the small business tax rate from 11 per cent to 9 per cent, a re-elected Liberal government will remove barriers to success by cutting fees, reducing red tape, and creating funds for new business owners to find support. We will also:

provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs a year with as much as $50,000 to launch a new business;
give $250 to every new business looking to expand their online services;
eliminate all fees from the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), Export Development Canada (EDC), and Farm Credit Canada, for business advisory services like mentorship and training;
cut the cost of federal incorporation by 75 per cent; and
eliminate the “swipe fee” on HST and GST for credit transactions — which will save businesses nearly $500 million a year in fees, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

These measures build on four years of strong Liberal support for small- and medium-sized businesses in Canada, including:

cutting the small business tax rate to nine per cent — the lowest rate in the G7 — which saves businesses as much as $7,500 per year;
allowing businesses to write-off job creating investments;
making regulations smarter and eliminating unnecessary and outdated regulations; and
opening up new markets for businesses by introducing the Export Diversification Strategy.

“More support for the wealthiest one percent won’t help the average Canadian get ahead,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Only Liberals have a plan to keep moving forward and give everyone a chance to succeed.”

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new ad highlighting that a re-elected Liberal government will give middle class families an extra $600 every year by lowering taxes, while a Conservative government would give more breaks to millionaires.
“We believe in helping those who need it most: middle class Canadians and people working hard to join them,” says the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, in the new ad. “We’re proposing a tax cut, where a middle class family gets $600 and the wealthiest one per cent get zero.”
Earlier this week, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will make sure middle class Canadians, and the people working to join the middle class, pay no federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn. This will be done by raising the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) by almost $2,000 for people earning under $147,000 a year.
This Liberal middle class tax cut will:

Save the average family nearly $600 a year;
Mean 700,000 people will pay no tax at all — nearly 60 per cent of whom are women;
Lift about 40,000 Canadians out of poverty; and
Benefit only the middle class and those working hard to join it, not the richest one percent.

Andrew Scheer has a plan that will lower taxes the most for wealthier Canadians. With his approach, a person making $40,000 will get less than a person making $400,000.
“Whenever the Conservatives cut taxes, they cut them for the wealthy — and in this election, it’s no different,” continues Mr. Trudeau in the ad. “The Conservative approach would go back to giving tax breaks to millionaires.”
This middle class tax cut is just one way a re-elected Liberal government will make life more affordable, saving Canadian families thousands of dollars each year. An average family in Canada will also:

Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by ten per cent once they turn 75, increasing by more $729 each year;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments if they’re buying their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save on medications their family needs when we implement Universal Pharmacare;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care by ten percent;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and get 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on World Teachers’ Day:
“On World Teachers’ Day, we recognize the mentors and guides who have helped us become the people we are today.
Everyone remembers the teacher who inspired them to find their passion, or who taught them lifelong values of hard work, perseverance, and integrity.
Being a teacher is about preparing kids to pursue their dreams, and helping them have confidence in their power to make a positive difference. They have an extraordinary impact because they never stop working for their students. That’s why, over the last four years, we have been there for our teachers, with everything from a tax benefit for teachers and early childhood educators, to investing in schools and Indigenous education across the country.
Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will keep moving forward, by creating more before and after school care spaces and making Canada Student Grants more generous.
This year’s theme – Young Teachers: The future of the Profession – reminds us not just of the remarkable teachers here in Canada, but of people around the world who are dedicated to giving their students the best possible start in life. Since 2015, Canada has been a leader in supporting education around the globe. At the G7 Leaders’ Summit, we mobilized a historic investment of almost $3.8 billion in education for women and girls in crisis and conflict situations. To build on this progress, we later welcomed an additional $527 million to help developing countries give every child access to quality education and modern skills training.
A re-elected Liberal government will continue this work, from spending no less than ten per cent of our international development assistance budget on education, to leading an international campaign to ensure all children living in refugee or displacement camps get a good education.
I am incredibly proud to have been a teacher, and to have worked alongside the people who go above and beyond to help every young person succeed. Today, let’s celebrate the teachers who change their students’ lives for the better, and create a brighter tomorrow for everyone.”

Calgary, AB – Justin Trudeau will join local Liberals for a Stampede donor appreciation event in Calgary, and a Day of Action event with Sukh Dhaliwal in Surrey—Newton, on July 13, 2019.
With 100 days until Election Day, Liberal candidates across Canada will be knocking on doors for a National Day of Action highlighting how the Canada Child Benefit, unlike Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer’s system which sent cheques to millionaires, has provided more money to 9 out of 10 families – and how the CCB is increasing again this month.
Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are focused on a strong plan for Canadian families: to strengthen the middle class, create good new jobs, grow the economy, and protect a healthy environment for our kids and grandkids. More than 197,000 Canadians have signed up as new Liberal since the last election, and that grassroots support continues to grow every day.
The Liberal Party of Canada has also committed to the strongest standards in federal politics for openness and transparency with political fundraising events, and is challenging other parties to do the same.

Andrew Scheer
Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada
1720-130 Albert St
Ottawa, ON
K1P 5G4
Dear Mr. Scheer,
Today, Ontario’s Francophones are celebrating more than 400 years of outstanding contributions to the cultural, social, economic and political life of our country.
Unfortunately, this contribution is under threat from the draconian cuts Doug Ford’s government has made to services for the Franco-Ontarian community.
The Liberal Party of Canada is a proud defender of official languages and will continue to stand united with Franco-Ontarians in protecting their linguistic rights. Our record includes, amongst other things:

The Action Plan for Official Languages 2018-2023 which includes a historic $2.7 billion investment;
A $675 million funding increase to the CBC/Radio-Canada;
Reinstatement and modernization of the Court Challenges Program;
Reinstatement of the long-form census;
Nomination of bilingual judges to the Supreme Court of Canada;
Prioritizing francophone immigration to Canada with the launch of a Francophone Immigration Strategy;
Commitment to modernize the Official Languages Act.

We regrettably note you have never had the courage to denounce Doug Ford’s direct attacks on the Franco-Ontarian community. By siding with Doug Ford, you have failed Francophones across the country.
Today, we call on you to once and for all denounce your friend Doug Ford’s deep cuts and that you commit to maintaining the funding we have put into place to support linguistic minorities.
In addition to denouncing Mr. Ford’s cuts, we call on you to explain to Canadians which services you plan to cut in order to balance the budget. Franco-Ontarians have every reason to fear the worst and that you will follow the same approach as Doug Ford: pretend you’re for the people during the election, then once elected, cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everyone else – and in this case, it is services for Francophones that will suffer.

Mona Fortier
Liberal candidate for Ottawa-Vanier and National Platform Committee Co-Chair

Victoria, BC – A re-elected Liberal government will help Canadians buy their first home.
For many young people starting their careers, saving up enough to make a down payment on a home is a far-off dream at best – and for ten years, Stephen Harper’s Conservatives did nothing to address these systemic problems. In the greater Toronto, Vancouver, and Victoria regions, people are facing these challenges head on, with housing prices up to sixty per cent higher than the national average.
“Many young Canadians dream of owning their first home. But with rising prices – and not enough homes to meet the demand – it’s getting harder and harder to make that dream a reality,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “Again and again, the Liberal government has stepped up to solve these challenges. Today, we’re announcing another important step to help Canadians buy their first home.”
In recent years, housing speculation by foreign owners has become a major challenge, driving up housing prices for people across the country. Canada is no place for those who wish to purely speculate in the housing market, and we need a national approach to protect families who are being priced out of buying a first home.
A re-elected Liberal government will:

fully implement the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, which provides Canadians with up to ten per cent off the purchase price of their first home;
immediately expand the Incentive to provide more help to communities in the greater Toronto, Vancouver, and Victoria regions by allowing homes valued at up to $789K to qualify;
address the impact of foreign speculation, which drives up housing costs, by putting in place a consistent national speculation and vacancy tax for non-resident, non-Canadians.

In addition to introducing the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, our Liberal government also:

launched Canada’s first-ever National Housing Strategy, a ten-year plan that will help more than 600,000 Canadians find safe and affordable places to live;
funded the construction of nearly 140,000 more housing units to be built by 2028; and
created the new Canada Housing Benefit to help 300,000 Canadians with the high costs of rent.

“The Conservatives voted against the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive and have no plan to help address the real concerns Canadians have about being able to own their own home,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Liberals believe in investing in people and in communities, which is why we are taking these steps to make homeownership an achievable dream, not just a privilege for the richest few.”

“Tonight, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese communities in Canada and around the world will celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Also known as the Moon Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a time for family and friends to come together to celebrate the harvest and give thanks for the year’s successes. A full moon will shine over the festivities – a symbol of prosperity and unity.
As we light lanterns and eat mooncakes, we are reminded of the many cultures and communities that make Canada such a great place to live. Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese Canadians make important contributions to our country every day, and help build a better Canada.
Today, let’s recognize the blessings of the season, and appreciate everything that unites us. On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a happy Mid-Autumn Festival.”

The leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Franco-Ontarian Day:
“Today we celebrate the rich history and significant contribution Franco-Ontarians have made to our country. On this Franco-Ontarian Day, I would like to acknowledge the largest Francophone minority community in the country.
On September 25, 1975, the beautiful Franco-Ontarian flag was raised for the first time in front of the University of Sudbury. I want to recognize the work of all those who still today defend their presence and their choice to live in French in Ontario. I also want to take the occasion to emphasize our ongoing commitment to always denounce injustice and to stand with the Franco-Ontarian community and with all Francophones.
Strengthening our official languages and the vitality of linguistic minority communities is rooted in the values of the Liberal Party of Canada. Everyday we work to make Canada a country where we can live and grow in the language of our choice.
Over the course of our mandate, we worked diligently with official language minority communities across Canada and we are proud of the work we accomplished. From our Action Plan for Official Languages which includes an historic $2.7 billion investment, to the restoration of the Court Challenges Program, the nomination of bilingual judges to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the recent memorandum of co-operation for the creation of a Francophone University in Ontario, we are and will be here for you.
As part of the modernization of the Official Languages Act, a re-elected Liberal government will continue its work and do even more. Together, we will take on important projects to benefit future generations of Francophones and Francophiles in Ontario and across Canada.”

Ottawa, ON – Liberal M.P. , the Hon. Carolyn Bennett, issued the following statement today:
“In December, First Nations Chiefs asked Andrew Scheer what his policy toward the spirit of reconciliation would be. How would he differ from his Conservative predecessors?
“They were not happy to hear his response that they should have patience and wait for his platform.
“Andrew Scheer has now completed his five “major policy speeches,” outlining his party’s next election platform. The word “reconciliation,” was not uttered once.
“His silence on this issue is not only disrespectful, it is totally irresponsible. There are more than 1.6 million First Nations, Inuit and Métis in Canada, and they are the fastest growing population. A “vision” for Canada that does not include a plan to recognize and implement the rights of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, or to close the socioeconomic gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples is completely unacceptable.
“Meanwhile, Andrew Scheer’s Conservative Senators are blocking Bill C-262, an important piece of legislation that would ensure that Canada’s laws respect the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Since they refuse to let this legislation pass, the Liberal Party will make it part of our election platform this fall.
“Andrew Scheer is applying to be the leader of our country. He has a responsibility to understand the issues facing the First Peoples of this country and work with First Nations, Inuit and Métis in order to come to the table with a real plan to address their priorities.
“Canadians have supported and are working towards a new relationship with indigenous peoples based upon the recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership.
“With his final policy speech yesterday, Andrew Scheer has confirmed what Canadians have long suspected: Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is not part of his Vision for Canada.
“Stephen Harper did not work with Indigenous peoples to advance reconciliation and demonstrated that he thought Ottawa knew best.
“Andrew Scheer has demonstrated that he is no different.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty:
“On International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, we come together to fight poverty and build a more just and equal future for people everywhere.
This year’s theme, Acting Together to Empower Children, their Families, and their Communities to End Poverty, highlights the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. No kid should grow up hungry, or without a safe place to live – but this is the reality for many of the world’s most vulnerable children. We need to do more to change that, and that’s why we’re working to break the cycles of poverty by investing in education at home and around the world. Under our G7 presidency, we worked with partners to announce a historic investment of $3.8 billion in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations – the largest of its kind ever made. Building on this success, we later welcomed another investment of $527 million, to help developing countries give every child access to quality education and modern skills training. And a few weeks ago, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will commit at least ten per cent of our international assistance to education, and lead global efforts to make sure kids growing up in refugee or displacement camps get the education they need and deserve.
Here in Canada, our Liberal government has worked hard to fight poverty and support kids and families. With measures like the Canada Child Benefit and the Poverty Reduction Strategy, our Liberal government lifted 900,000 people out of poverty – including 50,000 seniors and 300,000 kids. Unemployment is at its lowest since the 1970s – and since 2015, Canadians have created over a million new jobs. And that’s because we rejected Conservative cuts and austerity, and chose instead to invest in the middle class and people working hard to join it.
We’ve put more money in people’s pockets by cutting taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest one percent. We stopped sending child benefit cheques to millionaires, so we could send more to the single parent working two jobs, or the family of five who falls a bit short at the end of the month. We made the Canada Pension Plan even stronger, because in a country like ours, seniors shouldn’t struggle to make ends meet.
This kind of progress has been possible because Canadians chose a government that was willing to invest in people and families. The International Day for Eradication of Poverty reminds us how important that work is – and how much more we need to do to make life better for the most vulnerable. On October 21st, Canadians will once again make a choice about our future. Let’s stand united, choose forward, and keep building a better Canada for everyone.”

Toronto, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new radio ad to highlight that a re-elected Liberal government will ban assault rifles and continue to take serious, common-sense action to strengthen gun control.
“I spent decades working to keep my city safe and I know that the presence of a gun in a dangerous situation can make it deadly,” said Bill Blair, former Toronto Chief of Police and Liberal candidate for Scarborough Southwest, in the new ad. “We are going to do something about it with stronger gun control laws and a ban on assault rifles. The Conservatives talk tough but they won’t do what needs to be done. Soon, you’ll have a choice. Let the Conservatives weaken our gun control laws or make your communities safer by making gun laws stronger.”
Gun crime in Canada is on the rise, and today, our country has no clear classification for assault rifles — making it legal to buy several military-style weapons. With Bill C-71, we took important steps to make our communities safer, but we need to continue to take serious, common-sense action to strengthen gun control.
“Too many people have lost loved ones to gun violence. And too often, the culprit is military-style weapons designed to inflict mass human casualties — guns so dangerous that they have no place in our country,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Thoughts and prayers aren’t going to cut it. A Liberal government will strengthen gun control, and ban assault weapons in Canada.”

Last week, we announced important steps a re-elected Liberal government will take to strengthen gun control in Canada, including:
banning all military-style assault rifles, including the AR-15;
working with the provinces and territories to give municipalities the ability to further restrict — or ban — handguns; and
protecting the rights of law-abiding hunters and pledge not to bring back the long-gun registry. Hunters do not use or need assault weapons;
preventing people suspected of posing a danger to themselves or others — including their partners or kids — from possessing or acquiring new firearms;
requiring that everyone importing ammunition must show proof of a valid firearms license; and
making it harder for legal weapons to fall into the hands of criminals, by further strengthening safe-storage laws.

“Andrew Scheer’s policy on guns was written by the gun lobby. He has an agenda that will make it easier for criminals to get their hands on assault rifles,” said Mr. Trudeau. “It is shameful. We want stronger gun laws. The Conservatives want weaker ones. The choice is clear.”

Delta, B.C. – A re-elected Liberal government will help Canadians lower their energy bills, make their homes more energy-efficient, and give them the tools to prepare for climate related disasters.
Today, many Canadians live in homes that aren’t energy efficient – which means higher utility bills and more pollution. Meanwhile, more and more homes are in danger of being destroyed from the ever-increasing number of floods and wildfires. Climate change is real, and it’s happening now. As a country we must come together to fight it, and we also need to deal with its consequences.
“It’s expensive to adapt to a changing climate. We are going to help you replace those drafty windows or your old furnace – so you can cut your utility bills and keep our environment healthy,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We have a decision to make. We can go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change, or we can fight for a better future. The choice is that clear.”
A re-elected Liberal government will make life more affordable for Canadians, cut our emissions, and protect the environment.

We will help retrofit 1.5 million homes to help Canadians make their homes more energy efficient, and better protect them from climate-related risks;
We will help homeowners and landlords pay for retrofits by giving them an interest-free loan of up to $40,000;
We will help people buy newly built homes that are certified zero-emissions by giving them a Net Zero Homes Grant of up to $5,000; and
We will invest $100 million in skills training, to ensure there are enough qualified workers to keep up with energy audits, retrofits, and net-zero home construction.

We will also be there for Canadians when disaster strikes, by:

protecting homeowners who are at high risk of flooding and don’t have adequate insurance protection, by creating a low-cost national flood insurance program;
helping Canadians better understand the risks they face when they buy a home, by working with provinces and territories to complete all flood maps in Canada;
developing a national action plan to assist homeowners with potential relocation for those at the highest risk of repeat flooding; and
help Canadians whose jobs and livelihoods are affected when disaster strikes, by working with stakeholders and experts to design an E.I. Disaster Assistance Benefit.

These measures will build on four years of climate action by our government, including:

introducing over 50 measures to fight climate change and protect our environment, from banning single-use plastics to putting a price on pollution;
investing to encourage new homes to be built carbon neutral;
helping ensure Canadians have access to the most energy-efficient appliances to help cut energy costs and support our climate action goals; and
establishing the $2 billion Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund to help communities prevent and prepare for growing climate risks.

“Andrew Scheer doesn’t have a real climate plan. He wants to make pollution free again – which would increase our emissions,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Denial is not a policy. We can go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change – or fight for a better future. I’m for moving forward.”

Toronto (ON) — A re-elected Liberal government will ban assault weapons and strengthen gun control in Canada.
Gun crime in Canada is on the rise. In 2017, there were 2,500 more victims of gun violence than in 2013, and many of these incidents involved intimate partners. Today, Canada has no clear classification for assault rifles — making it legal to buy several military-style weapons.
“Too many people have lost loved ones to gun violence. And too often, the culprit is military-style weapons designed to inflict mass human casualties — guns so dangerous that they have no place in Canada,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Thoughts and prayers aren’t going to cut it. A Liberal government will ban assault weapons in Canada.”
A re-elected Liberal government will build on the important measures we passed in Bill C-71, and continue to take serious, common-sense action to crack down on gun crime:

We will ban all military-style assault rifles, including the AR-15;
We will work with the provinces and territories to give municipalities the ability to further restrict — or ban — handguns; and
We will protect the rights of law-abiding hunters and pledge not to bring back the long-gun registry. Hunters do not use or need assault weapons.

We will also take concrete steps — in partnership with our law enforcement agencies — to strengthen gun control.

We will prevent people suspected of posing a danger to themselves or others — including their partners or kids — from possessing or acquiring new firearms;
We will require that everyone importing ammunition must show proof of a valid firearms license; and
We will make it harder for legal weapons to fall into the hands of criminals, by further strengthening safe-storage laws.

Over the last four years, our government took strong action to reduce gun violence:

We reversed the gun laws introduced by Stephen Harper that made it easier to purchase and transfer a weapon;
We started requiring firearm retailers to conduct more extensive background checks; and
We gave provinces and territories more resources to combat gun and gang violence, by investing nearly $330 million through our comprehensive, national Guns and Gangs Strategy.

“Andrew Scheer’s policy on guns was written by the gun lobby. He has an agenda that will make it easier for criminals to get their hands on assault rifles,” said Mr. Trudeau. “It is shameful. It’s time to end gun violence in Canada.”

Burnaby, BC — A re-elected Liberal government will cut taxes in half for companies that produce zero emissions technologies, which will create jobs, grow Canadian businesses, and help us get to net-zero.
In the coming years, the market for clean technology — which uses renewable energy and emits less pollution — is expected to exceed $2.5 trillion by 2022. Canada will lead the way: to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, and to achieve the ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
“It’s time to be a part of the solution,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We have the talent, we have the vision, and we have the reputation of being the best place in the world to start and grow a zero emissions tech business.”
A re-elected Liberal government will make Canada the most attractive place to start — and grow — a business that produces zero emissions technology. We will:

Cut in half corporate taxes for companies that develop technologies or manufacture products that have zero emissions;
The corporate taxes for small cleantech businesses will be cut from 9 per cent to 4.5 per cent, and the larger cleantech companies will see their taxes drop from 15 percent to 7.5 per cent.
Continue to lead by example and ensure all federal buildings run on clean electricity by 2022; and
Leverage the purchasing power of the federal government to further drive clean technology adoption, by strengthening existing green procurement policies.

This builds on a strong Liberal record of encouraging businesses to invest in sustainability and create hundreds and thousands of jobs, including:
Allowing businesses to immediately write-off the full cost of installing clean energy equipment; and
Investing in the first ever completely electric mine, as well as the first zero-emissions aluminum smelter.
“From electric cars to renewable power, we’ve made huge leaps in what’s possible when it comes to protecting our air, our water, and our future,” said Mr. Trudeau. “While Conservatives want to make polluting free again, we’re looking forward — on the next generation of clean technology, built right here by Canadians.”

2019 French-language Leaders’ Debate
Once again, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau clearly demonstrated the choice Canadians have to make on October 21: keep moving forward with the progress achieved over the past four years, or go back to the politics of the Harper years. Here is what some people are saying about tonight’s debate:
Quotations are included in their original language
« L’attaque de Justin Trudeau fait mouche : « Vous étiez tous les deux avec Harper », dit-il à Bernier et Scheer qui s’inquiètent du déficit. Couper sous Harper « n’a pas livré une croissance économique », martèle-t-il. » – Antoine Robitaille (Journal de Québec), Twitter, 10 octobre, 2019

Richmond Hill, ON – Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, will deliver remarks to supporters at an open Liberal fundraising event in Richmond Hill, ON, on August 12, 2019.
In this fall’s important election, Ontarians and all Canadians will have a clear choice. While Conservatives want to go backward with cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class.
The Liberal Party of Canada has also committed to the strongest standards in federal politics for openness and transparency with political fundraising events, and is challenging other parties to do the same.

2019 English-language Leaders’ Debate
Last night, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau presented to Canadians his plan to continue investing in our middle class, grow the economy, and protect the environment. And the responses keep pouring in.
Quotations are included in their original language
“The most-passionate version of Trudeau emerged in the night’s final segment, on the environment and energy. There, again, Trudeau invoked the choice he wants voters to see, between Conservatives who would rip up the current plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and Liberals who are pledged to keep going.” – Aaron Wherry, CBC News, October 8, 2019
“Trudeau remained calm through the fast-paced debate, reciting his governing party’s record of investing in programs aimed at fostering prosperity.” – Alan Cochrane, Telegraph Journal, October 8, 2019
“Mr. Trudeau proved willing to fight back and make his Conservative political rival his rhetorical punching bag, forcing him to defend his stance on social issues such as abortion rights.” – Jessica Murphy, BBC News, October 8, 2019
« M. Trudeau a néanmoins réussi à se démarquer de son adversaire conservateur sur les questions sociales. M. Scheer a d’ailleurs prononcé les mots qu’il refusait de dire jeudi dernier, quand il a avancé que « comme des millions de Canadiens » il est « pro-vie ». Si l’objectif du chef libéral était de sortir du débat sans trop de blessures, il peut dire mission accomplie. » – Fanny Olivier, Radio-Canada, 7 octobre, 2019
“[Trudeau] emerged, it appears, unscathed, which for an incumbent is best you could hope for.” – Vassy Kapelos, CBC, October 7, 2019
“But ultimately I have to say probably the biggest winner out of this was the Prime Minister” – Jenni Byrne, CP24, October 7, 2019
“Overall Trudeau was strong; I don’t think anybody knocked him out of the ring.” – Tom Mulcair, News Talk 1010, October 8, 2019
“The loser tonight, sadly, was Mr. Scheer. And I say that because there were great expectations that he would effectively challenge Trudeau and he didn’t effectively challenge him.” – Robin Sears, CP24, October 7, 2019
“And Justin Trudeau for the most part, no gaffes, no mistakes. As steady as she goes for the most part for him tonight.” – Aleem Kanji (VP Government Relations – Sutherland Corporation), CTV News, October 7, 2019
« À plusieurs égards, le chef libéral Justin Trudeau a mieux défendu son bilan des quatre dernières années (…) il a aussi abondamment parlé des principales promesses contenues dans son programme électoral, ce qu’il avait omis de faire la semaine dernière. Il a finalement donné un certain sens à ce que pourrait être un second mandat libéral. » – Joël-Denis Bellavance, La Presse, 8 octobre 2019
“The loser in all this was Andrew Scheer. The Conservative leader needed to have a big night, after a week in which his reputation was pounded by his opponents for the alleged lack of transparency on his resumé, his views on issues of conscience and his nationality (…) If the Tories lose this election, putting a price on carbon is an issue they will have to revisit or risk being left looking like a BlackBerry in an iPhone world.” – John Ivison, National Post, October 8, 2019

Mississauga, ON – Today Andrew Scheer revealed his deep cuts will target $7.5 billion in direct support for jobs and workers across the country.
“Andrew Scheer needs to tell Canadians what jobs and workers he will target. Will he cut support for 6,900 steel workers in Hamilton, 200 aerospace workers in Nova Scotia, 2,100 steel workers in Regina and across Western Canada, or 450 cleantech jobs in British Columbia?” said Liberal candidate for Markham—Thornhill, Mary Ng. “Andrew Scheer is doing exactly what Conservative politicians do; they pretend they’re for the people during the election, then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everyone else – in this case, thousands of jobs across the country.”
“Included in Andrew Scheer’s announcement today are steel workers across Canada. In the face of punishing U.S. steel tariffs, Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government invested $100 million to protect 6,900 steel jobs in Hamilton alone. Andrew Scheer just turned his back on those steel workers,” said Ng.
“Andrew Scheer today promised he will cut $7.5 billion in jobs support – but his math doesn’t add up. What else will he cut?” said Ng. “Like Doug Ford, Andrew Scheer is promising cuts on a five-year timeline to balance the budget. The problem is that today’s announcement is far from the $39 billion he needs to cut to pay for all his campaign announcements so far.”

Tonight, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau underscored the choice Canadians have to make on October 21: keep moving forward with the progress achieved over the past four years or go back to the politics of the Harper years. Here is what some people are saying about tonight’s debate:
2019 TVA Face-to-Face Debate.
Quotations are included in their original language.
« On jase là… mettons qu’une partie de l’auditoire décide de se coucher après la 1ère heure: Trudeau est combatif, Blanchet est crédible, Singh dépasse les attentes sans tout casser, et Scheer va avoir mal partout demain matin… » – Jonathan Trudeau (Journal de Québec), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
« On peut critiquer la taxe sur le carbone. Mais il est archi-faux de dire qu’elle n’a pas d’effet significatif. Extrait du rapport du DPB: elle “réduirait les émissions de GES de 50 à 60 Mt en 2022” » – Paul Journet (La Presse), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
“Trudeau hammering hard on themes one and two in the debate so far, spending most of his time challenging Scheer vs Blanchet or Singh” – Mercedes Stephenson (Global), Twitter, 2 Oct 2019
“Trudeau is doing on Bill 21 what Scheer did not do on abortion – state his position” – Tasha Kheiriddin, Twitter, 2 Oct 2019
“Scheer repeats his thoroughly-debunked claim that his plan would do lots! for the environment.”– Justin Ling (Freelance Journalist), Twitter, October 2, 2019
« Premier moment fort : Trudeau insiste pour avoir l’opinion personnelle de Scheer sur l’avortement et le droit des femmes. Scheer refuse de répondre. Peu convaincant. » – Jonathan Trudeau (Journal de Québec), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
« Blanchet parle de l’épisode Anticosti en disant qu’il était content de se retirer de cela (après avoir été battu…) et que la cimenterie McInnis était un projet vert avant l’arrivée du PLQ… Heu? » – Jonathan Trudeau (Journal de Québec), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
« @yfblanchet défend l’exploration pétrolière du gouv. Marois sur Anticosti. “J’ai joué dans ce film-là”, admet-il. » – Fannie Olivier (Radio-Canada), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
« Constat : Chaque fois que Scheer hésite en français, Trudeau en profite pour le couper et prendre la parole. Scheer ne semble jamais pouvoir conserver la parole dans ces cas-là. » – Christopher G. Nardi (Journal de Montreal), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
“15 minutes in and Scheer has been the punching bag on social issues, so far. “Yes or no,” Trudeau presses him repeatedly on woman’s right to choose.” – Glen McGregor (CTV), Twitter, 2 Oct 2019
“Trudeau is using his superior linguistic skills to his advantage, making it difficult for Scheer to make his points. And a couple times Singh has kind of chimed in, agreeing with Trudeau’s attacks.” – Stephen Maher, Twitter, 2 Oct 2019
« Sur un éventuel pipeline vers l’Est, Scheer refuse de dire s’il l’imposerait au Québec. » – Étienne Leblanc (Radio-Canada), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
« En gros, la position de Scheer sur le pétrole, c’est que puisque c’est comme ça maintenant, on ne peut pas changer, parce que ça changerait comment c’est maintenant. » – Mathieu Charlebois (L’Actualité), Twitter, 2 oct 2019
“Trudeau pressed Scheer repeatedly on a woman’s right to choose.” – Associated Press, 2 Oct 2019
« Est-ce que c’est juste moi, ou j’ai de moins en moins l’impression d’entendre Jagmeet Singh au fur et à mesure que la soirée avance ? Peut-être juste une perception… » – Christopher G. Nardi (Journal de Montreal), Twitter, 2 oct 2019

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Global Dignity Day:
“Today, young people, students, teachers, and volunteers around the world will come together to celebrate the dignity inherent in all of us.
Global Dignity Day reminds us that everyone has the right to live in dignity. It’s about building a world where compassion and kindness win out over division and injustice – a world where everyone has a real and fair shot at success.
Advocates are working every day to build that world – and young people are leading that charge. Around the planet, they’re deepening our connections and creating a stronger global community – encouraging everyone to look beyond what divides us and celebrate the humanity we all share.
We have a lot to learn from our youngest leaders, who challenge us every day to do better and be better. Each day, we have the chance to make a difference, and put into practice values like kindness, generosity, openness, and respect. Even the smallest of actions can touch hearts and change lives.
As one of Global Dignity’s National Role Models, I encourage everyone to honour the inherent worth of others – today and every day. Let’s celebrate everything that unites us and lift each other up. Let’s look forward with hope – and move forward together.”

Montréal, QC – The Liberal Party of Canada is launching a significant new advertising campaign as the 2019 election approaches, highlighting how Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are the only party that will stand up for middle class families.
Beginning today, new french-language national advertising featuring Justin Trudeau will air in heavy rotation on television across Québec and online across Canada, accompanied by a series of radio ads from Liberal MPs that will begin airing today in every part of Québec. New billboards are also being placed on major routes leading to the new Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge, as a reminder of how Liberals took a stand for middle class families and removed the tolls that the Conservatives had planned for it.
“Since 2015, Justin Trudeau and our Liberal team have stood up for middle class families,” said Pablo Rodriguez, Québec Campaign Co-Chair and M.P. for Honoré-Mercier. “After 10 years of Stephen Harper’s failed policies left the middle class falling behind, we’ve been making real progress – with one million new jobs created, more money for families, and real action to protect our environment. But there’s so much more to do, and we will never stop working hard to build a better future.”
Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team have a real plan to strengthen the middle class, grow the economy, and make life better for Canadian families. By introducing the Canada Child Benefit, lowering taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest 1 percent, putting a national price on pollution, and protecting middle class jobs with the new NAFTA, Justin Trudeau has been taking a stand for Canadians – but there’s so much more to do, and we can’t let the Conservatives take us back to the failed policies of Stephen Harper.
“This fall, Quebecers and all Canadians will have a clear choice to make,” added Diane Lebouthillier, Québec Campaign Co-Chair and M.P. for Gaspésie—Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine. “While Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are focused on investing in the middle class, Andrew Scheer is focused on austerity and cutting vital services, just like Stephen Harper.”
Liberal campaigns across Canada have started 2019 strong, with a new by-election victory in Outremont, continued growth in grassroots fundraising, more than 200 nominated candidates, and the momentum of more than 1.5 million new conversations with Canadians and 1,000 volunteer engagement events over the past year – the party’s largest-ever volunteer mobilization outside of an election.

The Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement for Women’s History Month:
“During Women’s History Month, we celebrate the achievements of women and girls throughout our history and recognize the trailblazing women who have shaped our country.
From one generation to the next, women have built the Canada we know today – but their accomplishments have often gone unrecognized. Gender equality advocates have long led efforts to change that. This year’s theme, ‘Make An Impact,’ encourages us to celebrate their work, and spotlight women everywhere who are breaking glass ceilings and transforming our world for the better.
Over the last four years, our Liberal government has followed their lead. We’re helping more people learn about women leaders throughout our history, with initiatives like making Viola Desmond the face of the $10 bill – and we’re providing more support for the community organizations that are leading the fight for gender equality. Whether it’s launching the first ever federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence, or investing to double the number of women entrepreneurs by 2025, we’ve made progress to protect women’s rights and make sure people of all gender identities have a fair and equal chance to succeed. We’ve taken up this work beyond our borders, too – from our Feminist International Assistance Policy, to major investments in sexual and reproductive health rights, and in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations.
We’ve put gender equality at the heart of our work since day one – and we’ll continue to do so. Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will create hundreds of thousands of new before and after school care spaces, nearly double federal spending on child care, and move forward to deliver guaranteed paid family leave for every new parent in Canada. Because child care still falls disproportionately to women, these measures represent an important step forward for gender equality and will make a difference for families across Canada.
We know there is much more to do to make sure women’s contributions are valued, their voices are heard, and their rights are respected – especially for the most vulnerable women. Trans women, Indigenous women, racialized women, women with disabilities, low-income women, migrant and refugee women, and people of diverse gender identities still face unequal, unacceptable obstacles – and many activists from these groups are leading the fight to change that. Their work is part of a long history of women breaking down barriers – and building a better Canada.
In 2019, we’ve seen an attack on women’s rights around the world, from the legitimization of gender-based violence, to the assault on a woman’s right to choose. Even in Canada, some politicians are intent on rolling back rights and cutting access to important services like health care and sexual assault centres. Women’s History Month reminds us that we can’t lose ground on gender equality – and we need to stand with those who are fighting for it. Today, and every day, let’s come together for a more equal world, and choose forward, for all of us.”

Today, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, issued the following statement on the start of Gender Equality Week:
Gender equality benefits all of us. When everyone has a fair and equal chance to succeed, we all do better – whether it’s building peace, fighting the climate crisis, or growing economies that work for everyone. We all have a role to play to make that a reality, and Gender Equality Week is a chance to move forward.
Just this past week, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will create hundreds of thousands of new before and after school care spaces, nearly double federal spending on child care, and move forward to deliver guaranteed paid family leave for every new parent in Canada. Because child care still falls disproportionately to women, these measures represent an important step forward for gender equality and will make a difference for families across Canada.
Our Liberal government has put gender equality at the heart of our work since day one. Over the last four years, we took historic steps to advance the rights of women, girls, and people of all gender identities. We passed unprecedented pay equity legislation, and legislation that added gender identity and expression as a protected ground in the Canada Human Rights Act. We took action to promote women’s leadership on boards and in the C-suite, and boosted support for women entrepreneurs with a plan to double the number of women entrepreneurs by 2025. We also created the first ever federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence, and with our National Housing Strategy, we’ve created more than 7,000 shelter spaces for survivors of family violence, and are making sure women, their families and their kids have access to safe, affordable housing.
Beyond our borders, we launched Canada’s first Feminist International Assistance Policy, which puts the empowerment, education, and health of women and girls at the centre of all our development assistance. We created the first ever Gender Equality Advisory Council to the G7 – and thanks to their leadership, we delivered a historic investment in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations. This summer, we also announced an unprecedented investment to protect the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls everywhere, including universal access to family planning, contraception, comprehensive sexuality education, and access to safe and legal abortion and post-abortion care. Canada also co-chaired the Equal Rights Coalition, the first intergovernmental network formed to promote and protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people around the world.
But there is still so much more to do. Women’s rights and gender equality are under attack around the world, from the legitimization of gender-based violence, to the assault on a woman’s right to choose. Trans women, Indigenous women, racialized women, women with disabilities, low-income women, migrant and refugee women, and people of diverse gender identities still face unequal, unacceptable barriers. That has to change.
We’re going to take up that work, just as we’ve done so far. Even in Canada, while some politicians are intent on rolling back rights and cutting access to important services like health care and sexual assault centres, Gender Equality Week reminds us that we have the choice to keep moving forward. Let’s stand united, work together, and build a more equal Canada, and a better world for everyone.

Ottawa, ON — For the first time ever, young Canadians will outnumber every other voting-aged generation. They have the power to help move Canada forward, standing up against the Conservatives’ cuts and regressive politics.
Today, Liberal candidates Catherine McKenna, Harjit Sajjan and Mélanie Joly are encouraging young people to use that power and vote — especially now that it’s easier than ever, with special voting stations opening on a number of college and university campuses from today until October 9.
Up To YOUth — a campaign created by young leaders involved with the Liberal Party of Canada — is also highlighting why a re-elected Liberal government is the best choice to move Canada forward on the issues that young Canadians care most about.
“The things we’re talking about as Liberals — more affordable tuition, rent and cell phone bills, stronger actions to fight climate change — they’re resonating with young people,” said McKenna, the Liberal candidate in the riding of Ottawa Centre. “So we’re seeing more and more young people stepping up and asking how they can be partners in creating a Canada that is more fair, and more affordable, for everyone.”
In 2015, young people came out in record numbers to elect Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party — countering the idea that they care less about democracy, or are less engaged with what’s happening in the world.
“Young people care about improving the lives of others, about fighting the climate crisis, and ensuring that everyone feels welcome and accepted in Canada,” said Sajjan, the Liberal candidate in the riding of Vancouver South. “Those values are Liberal values, and young people see that.”
For example, a re-elected Liberal government will:

Give up to $1,200 more each year to students to pay for tuition, books and rent by increasing Canada Student Grants by 40 per cent;
Give students two years — interest free — before they need to begin repaying student loans, and then only if they’re earning at least $35,000.
Make life more affordable for young people, lowering cell phone bills by 25 per cent and saving first time homebuyers hundreds on their mortgage each month;
Get Canada to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, in part by planting two billion trees;
Continue to make big polluters pay, and conserving 25 per cent of Canada’s land and waters;
Protect women’s rights to make decisions about their bodies, and improve their access to health care;
Set clear national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get the support they need quickly, when they need it most;
Protect same-sex marriage, ban conversion therapy and fund more LGBTQ2 community groups;
Fight racism, and target online hate speech, exploitation, bullying and harassment; and
Make big corporations and the wealthiest one per cent of Canadians pay their fair share of taxes.

“Young people are paying attention — they know what an Andrew Scheer government will do,” said Ahuntsic-Cartierville Liberal candidate, Joly. “The very wealthiest will get to keep more money. Big polluters will get to dirty our air and water for free again. Debates we thought were over — about abortion or same-sex marriage — will resurface. Young people aren’t going to stand by and let that happen, and neither will we.”

Toronto, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released new ads warning Canadians that Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives would cut and paste from the playbook of Stephen Harper — making deep cuts to programs and less help for the people who need it.
“I’ve seen all kinds of governments come and go,” says Lawrence MacAulay, Liberal candidate in the riding of Cardigan, in one of the new ads. “When we elected the Conservatives all they did was cut taxes for the wealthy, and cut services for everyone else.”
Since 2015, a Liberal government has worked hard to undo the harmful changes made by the Conservatives. For example:

After Stephen Harper raised the retirement age to 67, we lowered it back to 65 and increased Old Age Security (OAS) payments;
After Harper closed offices and clawed back benefits for veterans, we re-opened those offices and re-instated lifelong pensions; and
After the Conservatives kept sending child care cheques to millionaires, we created the tax-free and more generous Canada Child Benefit — putting hundreds of dollars back into the pockets of middle class families, and those working hard to join the middle class.

Now, Andrew Scheer’s plan will lower taxes the most for wealthier Canadians. With his approach, a person making $40,000 will get less than a person making $400,000. He also voted against lowering the OAS eligibility age from 67 to 65 — which boosts seniors’ retirement savings by thousands of dollars — and his party pledged to reverse the changes we made to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan.
The Liberal plan, however, builds on the progress we’ve made investing in families, workers, and communities. Under our plan, we will cut taxes for the middle class, without giving a break to millionaires. We will give more help to older Canadians and veterans. And we will continue to take bold action to protect our environment and fight climate change.
“Soon, Canadians will have a choice to make,” said Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “Go back to the Harper years, or keep moving forward with a government that stands by all Canadians.”

MONTRÉAL (QC) — A re-elected Liberal government will continue to protect and grow our cultural and creative industries, and make sure more people have access to our culture.
Whether it’s the writers who tell our stories, the comedians who make us laugh, or the artists who give us the soundtrack to our lives, Canadians are proud of the creativity we share – here at home and with the rest of the world. Meanwhile, to help bring people together, it’s vital that we preserve Canadian heritage by protecting and maintaining the places that have marked our country’s history.
“Culture is on the investment list for the Liberal Party. For the Conservatives, it’s on the list of things to cut,” said Pablo Rodriguez, the Liberal candidate for Honoré–Mercier. “Culture is who we are – past, present, and future. A Liberal government will always protect and promote culture and our official languages.”

To make sure more people have access to Canadian culture, at home and around the world, and to make sure our artists can keep telling our stories, we will:
create the Culture Pass, a $200 credit that every kid will receive at age 12, to be used to discover local Canadian content;
continue to support Canadian film by increasing annual funding for Telefilm Canada by nearly 50 per cent a year;
strengthen the regional mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada, so that local stations can broadcast more local news, and
require CBC/Radio-Canada to open up its digital platform, so that journalism start-ups and community newspapers can access affordable technology to develop and distribute local content;
introduce a new Cultural Diplomacy strategy, with at least one international mission each year to promote our culture and creators around the world; and
move forward, in our first year, with legislation to ensure that all content providers – including internet giants – offer meaningful levels of Canadian content in their catalogues, contribute to the creation of Canadian content in both official languages, and promote this content on their platforms.

“Our cultural industry is at a crossroads, and it just can’t afford a Conservative mandate,” said Annie Talbot, the Liberal candidate for Portneuf–Jacques-Cartier. “It’s 2019, but our main culture and communications laws are still from before the internet. The work Janet Yale and her team are doing to examine these laws is essential. We’re looking forward to reading her final report, and if Canadians give us another mandate, we’ll quickly take the necessary measures once the report is delivered.”
“I’m deeply proud to be part of a team that stood up to the Trump administration during the NAFTA negotiations to save the cultural exemption. Meanwhile, Andrew Scheer asked the government to make concessions to get a deal more quickly,” said Geneviève Hinse, the Liberal candidate for Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie. “You can be certain that a re-elected Liberal government will keep standing up for culture.”

Ottawa, ON – The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Rosh Hashana:
“Tonight, at sunset, Jewish communities in Canada and around the world will celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.
Rosh Hashana marks the start of the High Holidays, culminating in Yom Kippur. It is a time to reflect on the past year, and turn towards the future with hope. As family and friends dip apples in honey and share special meals together, we remember what matters most – spending time with loved ones and working to build a better world.
Just like today is a chance to celebrate the many contributions of Jewish Canadians, it is also a time to recommit to fighting antisemitism, hatred, and discrimination in all their forms. For many Jewish Canadians, this year has been a difficult one. Communities in Canada and beyond have suffered violent acts of hate – acts that have no place in our country, or our world. We will always stand with the Jewish community, and stand united against hate – and together, we will make our world a better one.
Our diversity, compassion, and openness are Canada’s strengths. Today, I encourage all Canadians to reflect on how we can bring those values to life every day.
On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a joyful and peaceful New Year.
Shana Tova Umetuka!”

Sudbury, ON — A re-elected Liberal government will protect 25 per cent of Canada’s land and 25 per cent of Canada’s oceans by 2025, as well as give every kid in Canada the chance to learn to camp.
Canada has the longest coastline in the world, one-fifth of the world’s fresh water, and vast and wild forests — but climate change puts them all at risk. It’s more important than ever to protect the natural landscape we know and love. At the same time, Canadians of all ages should have the chance to enjoy our natural wonders and learn more about our country.
“We have listened to the courageous voices of young people who are demanding that their governments take bold action to protect our nature for future generations,” said Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “And we know that we raise environmental champions by helping the next generation experience Canada’s natural beauty firsthand.”
A re-elected Liberal will continue down the path of conservation and environmental protection:

We will conserve and protect 25 per cent of Canada’s land and 25 per cent of Canada’s oceans by 2025, working towards 30 per cent of each by 2030;
We will ground these efforts in science, Indigenous knowledge, and local perspectives;
We will also advocate for countries around the world to set a 30 per cent conservation goal as well;
We will give every child the chance to learn how to camp by the time they reach grade eight, expanding the successful Learn to Camp program:
This will make it possible for 400,000 kids each year to learn the skills to enjoy camping; and
We will give 75,000 less privileged children and their families an up to four night trip to one of Canada’s National or Provincial Parks:
This includes camping accommodations and a travel bursary of up to $2,000 so that families can more easily afford a once-in-a-lifetime trip to more national parks like Banff, Gros Morne, Forillon and the Cape Breton Highlands.

This builds on a strong Liberal tradition of protecting Canada’s land and oceans, including:

Making the largest investment in nature conservation in Canadian history;
Conserving land areas equal to about 3.5 times the size of Nova Scotia;
Boosting the amount of protected coastal and ocean areas from 1 per cent to 14 per cent;
Creating Rouge National Urban Park, North America’s largest urban park, and the Edéhzhíe Protected Area, the first Indigenous protected area;
Working in partnership with Inuit to protect the Arctic’s last year-round sea ice, as well as sensitive areas in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and glass sponge reefs off the coast of British Columbia.

“The Conservatives spent a decade starving Parks Canada of funding, and ripping up protections for nearly all Canadian waters,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We only get one planet, and one Canada. Let’s protect it, for our kids and grandkids to enjoy — today and for years to come.”

Montréal, QC – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new TV ad to highlight that a re-elected Liberal government will continue to advance gender equality and promote women’s rights.
“As women, we have a lot to be proud of, in a country where we embrace our differences, and where we’ve protected a woman’s right to choose. And when we’re proud, we choose forward,” said Mélanie Joly, Liberal candidate for Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Valérie Renaud-Martin, Liberal candidate for Trois-Rivières, and Chantal Pilon, Liberal candidate for Rimouski-Neigette-Témiscouata-Les Basques in the new ad.
Last week, we announced important measures that a re-elected Liberal government will take to support women, including creating hundreds of thousands of new before and after school care spaces, nearly doubling federal spending on child care, and moving forward to deliver Guaranteed Paid Family Leave for every new parent in Canada. Because child care still falls disproportionately to women, these measures represent an important step forward for gender equality and will make a difference for families across Canada.
“Our Liberal government has put gender equality at the heart of our work since day one. And whether it’s here at home or beyond our borders, we’ve made important progress,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “But there’s so much more to do – and we’re going to keep working together to build a more equal Canada and a better world.”
Over the last four years, the Liberal government took historic steps to advance the rights of women, girls, and people of all gender identities.

We passed unprecedented pay equity legislation;
We took action to promote women’s leadership on boards and in the C-suite;
We boosted support for women entrepreneurs with a plan to double the number of women entrepreneurs by 2025;
We created the first ever federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence;
We created more than 7,000 shelter spaces for survivors of family violence through our National Housing Strategy;
We launched Canada’s first Feminist International Assistance Policy;
We announced an unprecedented investment to protect the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls everywhere, including universal access to family planning, contraception, comprehensive sexuality education, and access to safe and legal abortion and post-abortion care; and
We passed legislation that added gender identity and expression as a protected ground in the Canada Human Rights Act.

“Whether it’s health care or support for survivors of sexual assault, the Conservatives want to slash access to vital services and roll back the clock on women’s rights,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We can’t take the progress we’ve made for granted. We have to stand united, work together, and choose forward on gender equality.”

Montréal, QC — A re-elected Liberal government will plant two billion trees, using the power of nature to help fight climate change and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
Canada’s vast forests, grasslands, and wetlands help clean our air, safeguard our water, and provide crucial wildlife habitat. But just as nature is under threat by climate change, it can also be a critical ally in the fight against it. Natural climate solutions like planting trees and protecting grasslands can also help get Canada significantly closer to reaching its emissions-reduction targets.
“Nature isn’t just part of our identity as Canadians. It’s part of the solution to climate change. And it’s a solution we can start using today,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “Trees are a fundamental part of a cleaner future. They’re renewable. They’re sustainable. And, eventually, they recycle themselves. All we have to do is plant the first one.”
A re-elected Liberal government will use the power of nature to fight climate change:

We will launch an ambitious program to plant two billion trees over ten years, as part of a $3 billion effort to deploy natural climate solutions.
This program will also take concrete action to conserve and restore Canada’s forests, grasslands, agricultural lands, wetlands, and coastal areas;
We will support about 3,500 seasonal jobs in tree planting;
We will help cities expand and diversify their urban forests; and
We will protect Canada’s trees from infestations, and help rebuild our forests after a wild-fire.

This builds on a strong Liberal record of protecting the environment, including:

Committing to increase Canada’s land and ocean conservation to 25 per cent by 2025 and 30 per cent by 2030;
Making the largest investment in nature conservation in Canada’s history — $1.35 billion in protecting more land and waters, and supporting species at risk.

“When Doug Ford took an axe to Ontario’s tree planting programs and the seasonal jobs it supported, we took a stand,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We can either go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change — or fight for a better future. I’m for moving forward.”

Fredericton, NB — A re-elected Liberal government will increase Old Age Security by an extra ten per cent once a senior turns 75, and will boost the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit by 25 per cent.
Canadians are living longer than ever before, but as they age they face higher health care costs, and they’re worried about their savings running out. The number of seniors who rely on Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) payments — a monthly benefit that goes to the poorest seniors — goes up with age. Today, as many as 238,000 seniors live in poverty.
“Over the last four years, we’ve expanded benefits for older Canadians — helping lift 50,000 seniors out of poverty,” said Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “But we know many seniors still struggle to keep up with their bills as they age. After a lifetime of hard work, people should have peace of mind knowing their retirement savings won’t run out, and that their government will be there to help.”
A re-elected Liberal government will take meaningful action — working in partnership with provinces and territories — to further strengthen the supports that our seniors rely on every day:

We will put up to $729 more in the pockets of seniors each year, by increasing Old Age Security (OAS) by ten per cent once they turn 75. This will help lift more than 20,000 seniors out of poverty, of whom two-thirds will be women; and
We will give up to $2,080 in additional benefits, every year, to those who’ve lost a loved one, by increasing the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) survivor’s benefit by 25 per cent.

Since 2015, we have taken real action to help more Canadians retire with confidence, including:

Restoring the eligibility age for OAS and GIS benefits to 65 from 67;
Making the most significant enhancement to the CPP since its creation — which will raise the maximum CPP benefit by up to 50 per cent once fully rolled-out;
Giving single seniors nearly $1,000 more a year to help pay the bills, through our boost to the GIS top-up; and
Increasing the GIS earnings exemption, so that low-income seniors who choose to keep working can keep more of their hard-earned income.

“Andrew Scheer voted against lowering the OAS eligibility age from 67 to 65, which boosts seniors’ retirement savings by thousands of dollars and lets them retire earlier, so they can spend more time with their grandkids,” said Mr. Trudeau. “His party also pledged to reverse the changes we made to strengthen the CPP. Seniors deserve more from their government, and if re-elected, we will continue to work to make sure they have a safe, secure, and dignified retirement.”

It’s now been a week since Andrew Scheer tried to slip his cuts plan by Canadians, hoping they wouldn’t notice. But no one fell for it. Every day, Canadians are asking what Andrew Scheer’s cut plans means for their communities. Here is what some of them are saying:
Quotations are included in their original language
“Trudeau and the Liberals have accomplished important things since 2015. And they offer the best program for continuing in that positive direction over the next four years.” – Toronto Star Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
« Andrew Scheer ne semble pas particulièrement fier de son cadre financier. Il l’a rendu public quelques heures après le dernier débat des chefs, juste avant un long week-end où l’annonce serait forcément noyée. Qu’y retrouve-t-on, au juste ? Une feuille de route qui ressemble à celle de son prédécesseur, Stephen Harper. » – François Cardinal, La Presse, 18 octobre 2019
« [La plan d’Andrew Scheer] l’oblige évidemment à multiplier les compressions pour espérer atteindre l’équilibre budgétaire en cinq ans. Des compressions dans les infrastructures, la sécurité nationale et l’environnement, entre autres, qui s’annoncent… plus importantes que celles imposées par M. Harper. Ce qui risque d’avoir un effet concret réel, notamment en matière d’investissements en transports en commun. » – François Cardinal, La Presse, 18 octobre 2019
“[T]he government made a fundamental choice at the beginning of its mandate to make sure the wealth is more evenly shared. It cut taxes on the middle class, raised them on the wealthy and directed a lot more support to families with the new Canada Child Benefit. All that made a huge difference in the lives of many people, especially those on low incomes. The child benefit, in particular, is a key reason why more than 800,000 people, including some 300,000 children, have escaped poverty over the past few years. This is no small thing; it simply wouldn’t have happened if the Conservatives had remained in power and put austerity ahead of people.” – Toronto Star Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“On housing Andrew Scheer would move us backwards and make housing less affordable. On transit Andrew Scheer’s $18B cut to infrastructure would kill SkyTrain to UBC. On opioids Andrew Scheer would drag us back into court while more people die.” – Kennedy Stewart (Mayor of Vancouver), Statement, October 16, 2019
“There are shortcomings in [the Conservative] platform that are of concern to me.” – John Tory (Mayor of Toronto), Toronto Star, October 17, 2019
“[Andrew Scheer’s proposed] postponement of infrastructure investments is something that is not in the best interests of Toronto or cities across the country” and [Conservatives haven’t] “said as much about housing” [as other parties]. – John Tory (Mayor of Toronto), Toronto Star, October 17, 2019
“[Conservatives] would slash $18 billion from infrastructure spending, killing or delaying badly needed projects across the country. They would cut deeply in spending on government operations, a promise reminiscent of Doug Ford’s pledge to cut “fat.” We know how that’s turning out in Ontario. Under Scheer, the Conservatives would lurch to the right in foreign affairs. And, crucially, they would throw the government into reverse when it comes to effective action on climate change.” – Toronto Star Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“Liberal management of the economy has led to near record low unemployment, strong job creation and needed infrastructure investment. The Conservative claim to superiority is largely around promised tax cuts, but the truth is that tax cuts alone have not in the past generated comparable economic strength and sustained prosperity.” – Hamilton Spectator Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“The Liberals also chose to spread wealth more evenly. Taxes on the middle class were reduced and the Canada Child Benefit was introduced. Thanks to the CCB, 800,000 people, including 300,000 children, have been lifted out of poverty. This would not have happened under an austerity-driven Conservative government.” – Hamilton Spectator Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“The Conservatives would kill the carbon tax, tax big polluters and encourage green innovation. That, as numerous scientists have pointed out, isn’t even a plan. Under Scheer’s Conservatives, Canada would move backwards, which would be shirking our responsibility to future generations.” – Hamilton Spectator Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
« Contrairement à ce qu’il affirmait cette semaine, l’engagement du chef conservateur Andrew Scheer à financer ses promesses en réduisant les investissements prévus dans les infrastructures menace la construction d’un tramway à Québec, en plus de certains projets prévus à Montréal. » – Claude Villeneuve, Journal de Montréal, 18 octobre, 2019
« Si on réduit les investissements totaux en infrastructures, nécessairement, Montréal aura moins. À la ville, on évalue que c’est une somme de 1,6 milliard qui est en jeu, ce qui compromettrait la réalisation de projets de 4 milliards financés conjointement avec Québec. » – Claude Villeneuve, Journal de Montréal, 18 octobre, 2019

Ottawa, ON – The Liberal Party of Canada is heading into this fall’s election campaign supported by its best-ever second quarter for grassroots fundraising results, with more than 41,500 Canadians contributing $5,033,998 to support Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team’s progress to invest in the middle class.
A record-breaking Q2 builds on grassroots Liberals also recently achieving the party’s best-ever Q3 and Q4 fundraising results outside of an election campaign, and each of the last five months has set a new monthly best. The median donation to the Liberal Party in Q2 was just $15 at a time, and 95 percent of all donations were under $200.
“Liberals are starting this important election campaign with new records for grassroots fundraising and incredible hope and hard work by volunteers in communities across Canada,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “As we head to the polls this fall, Canadians will have a clear choice. While Conservatives want to go backward with divisive politics and cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class.”
Filings with Elections Canada also continue to highlight that Liberal supporters are getting far more value for their donations than Conservatives. Annual returns since the last campaign show that the Conservative Party spent $22,519,872 on fundraising expenses throughout 2016-2018, while the Liberal Party spent just $9,254,606.
The Liberal Party was also the first and only party to move forward with the strongest standards in federal politics for open and transparent political fundraising events. This is in clear contrast to the Conservative Party and the NDP, who have continued to bar journalists and keep Canadians in the dark about what is being said behind closed doors.
Throughout this mandate, local Liberal riding associations have also continued to outraise their Conservative counterparts by as much as 3-to-1.

Gatineau, QC – Tonight, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, showed once again that the Liberals are the only party with a credible plan for the environment, the economy, and middle-class families.
“What we saw in 2015 was that Quebecers and Canadians chose to be part of a government. That’s what ended Mr. Harper’s 10 years of not investing in culture and cutting everywhere, said the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, during the debate. We will always stand up for our values ​​and principles, such as the right of women to choose and the rights of Francophones across Canada. That’s what we will always do.”
Once again, the debate made it clear that Andrew Scheer is completely disconnected from the reality of Quebecers and Francophone communities across the country. His divisive policies and negative tone offer nothing concrete for young people, middle-class families, and seniors. We know that the Conservatives’ phantom platform will give $50,000 in tax credits to millionaires, but with only a few days left until the election, we still don’t know which services they will cut.
Just like we’ve done for the last four years, the Liberal Party is choosing to invest in middle-class families by putting even more money back in their pockets, whether by cutting their taxes or lowering their cell phone bills.
Justin Trudeau also took the opportunity to remind Canadians that the Liberal Party is the only one with a credible plan to fight climate change while creating good jobs — from planting two billion trees, to helping Canadians retrofit their homes to make them more energy-efficient.
Finally, Justin Trudeau reaffirmed that a diverse and open Canada is a stronger Canada. Newcomers grow our economy, strengthen our communities, and help reduce labour shortages.
“In a few days, Quebecers — and all Canadians — will have a choice to make about the future of our country,” said Justin Trudeau. “If the environment, the rising cost of living, and gun control matter to you, the Liberal Party is the party that will deliver. It’s by electing people to government — not to the opposition benches — that we can make progress. On October 21, let’s pull together and continue to move forward.”

Mr. Yves Côté
Commissioner of Canada Elections
30 Victoria Street
Gatineau, Quebec
K1A 0M6
Dear Mr. Côté:
I write to draw your attention to a number of examples of partisan activities carried out by the Canadian Shooting Sports Association (CSSA) that appear to be in breach of the Elections Canada rules for third parties. I trust you will examine these possible violations of the new third party provisions contained in the Canada Elections Act (S.C. 2000, c.9).
On September 20, 2019, our Party’s leader, Mr. Justin Trudeau, announced that a re-elected Liberal government will take serious, common-sense action to strengthen gun control and crack down on gun crime. Specifically, if re-elected, we will ban all military-style assault rifles and also work with municipalities to give them the ability to further restrict or ban handguns. We will work with law enforcement to strengthen safe-storage laws and limit the glorification of violence by creating new rules on where and how guns are advertised, marketed, and sold in Canada.
We will continue to respect Canadian hunters, farmers, and sport shooters. We will not bring back the long-gun registry. Hunters neither use nor need assault weapons.
In response to this announcement, the CSSA disseminated a newsletter on September 23, 2019 that states: “With the 2019 federal election looming, the CSSA is putting its members’ money where its mouth is. We commissioned a series of videos in English and Mandarin with a simple message: if you use or own guns, you must vote in Election 2019.” The CSSA also encourages members to oppose their local Liberal candidate in the election.
Further to that, the CSSA states that its video commercials are “already running on Citytv and the Wild TV networks.”
As of September 25, 2019, the CSSA is not listed on the Elections Canada website as a registered third party for the purposes of the 43rd General Election, despite having apparently incurred more than $500 in regulated expenses. Additionally, the videos posted online, which the organization states are airing on television, do not bear the requisite authorization tag for election advertisements. This raises concerns with respect to the transparency of the third party advertiser.
I trust you will review the attached materials and consider our serious concerns from a compliance standpoint.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Yours sincerely,

Adam Vaughan
Liberal candidate for Spadina-Fort York

Ottawa, ON – If the Conservatives had their way during the NAFTA negotiations, Canada would have backed down.
“In the NAFTA negotiations, our Liberal government fought tooth and nail to protect Canadian jobs. We said we would get a good deal, and that’s exactly what we achieved,” said Chrystia Freeland, Liberal candidate in the Toronto riding of University—Rosedale. “Conservatives urged Canada to fold to America’s demands — no matter the cost to our economy or middle class workers.”
Here’s how the Conservatives would have backed down to the United States:

Stephen Harper – in the fall of 2017, Harper released a memo that publicly said Canada has no leverage and needs to accept American demands. “Canada will be left with no option but to gradually capitulate,” Harper said. He was wrong. Macleans described Harper’s bad negotiating strategy: “What would Harper have the Canadian bargaining position be? In the absence of red lines drawn in public, apparently he would have the Canadian negotiating team tell the Americans, again in public: ‘We have no bottom line.’” (Macleans, Oct 30, 2017)
Andrew Scheer – In August 2018, when the United States told Canada to take-it-or-leave it. We said no and held out for a better deal.But Andrew Scheer and Erin O’Toole panicked. “Canadians are now on the outside,” tweeted Scheer, urging us to join the U.S.-Mexico deal. As we negotiated hard for the next six weeks, Conservatives publicly urged us to submit to the American offer.
Steel & Aluminum – The Conservatives repeatedly urged us to back down to the Americans by dropping retaliatory steel & aluminum tariffs. If we took the Conservative advice, the U.S. tariffs would still be in place. On February 4, 2019, Doug Ford’s Conservatives held a press conference calling on us to unilaterally and unconditionally drop our countermeasures. And taking his cue from Doug Ford, Erin O’Toole tweeted that we should drop our retaliatory measures.

“We stood up to Donald Trump on trade when the Conservatives wanted Canada to back down. The Conservatives told us to take any deal we could get. Capitulation is not a negotiating strategy,” said Freeland.

Hamilton, ON – A re-elected Liberal government will make sure every Canadian has access to a family doctor, to mental health services, to affordable prescription drugs, and to national pharmacare.
Canada’s health care system is a source of pride, but too many people still slip through the cracks. Today, nearly five million Canadians have no access to a family physician or a primary care team. All of us know someone who has gone through a mental health issue – but many people can’t get the help they need because it costs too much or the wait time is too long. And nearly one million Canadians skimp on food and heat to be able to pay for the medications they depend on, from insulin to inhalers.
“No one should go without the care they need because they don’t have access to a family doctor. And no one should have to give up food and heat to be able to pay for health care – whether it’s insulin, inhalers, or mental health support,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We’re going to close the gaps in the health care system, and make sure people can get the care they need, when they need it most.”
A re-elected Liberal government will make sure Canadians can afford and access lifesaving health care.
We will improve people’s access to health care by:

ensuring that every Canadian can easily find a family doctor or primary care team;
setting clear national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get the support they need quickly, when they need it most; and
continuing to make home care and palliative care more available to those who need it.

We will make sure everyone can afford the medications they need by:

implementing Universal Pharmacare, so that all Canadians have the drug coverage they need at an affordable price;
establishing the Canada Drug Agency to make drug purchasing more effective and efficient, and implementing a national formulary with partners to set prices; and
bringing down the cost of lifesaving high-cost drugs for families through the Rare Disease Drug Strategy.

Our government has made some of the most needed, significant changes to Canada’s health care system in decades. Over the past four years, we have:

helped more people access home care and mental health care through new health agreements with all the provinces and territories, allocating $11 billion in new funding;
undertaken the most comprehensive overhaul of drug pricing in thirty years, which will save Canadians approximately $13 billion over the next decade;
invested $500 million a year towards the creation of a rare disease drug strategy; and
taken the first steps to building a national pharmacare system.

“In the future, the federal government will have to negotiate with the provinces and territories, as has always been the case, to reach new health accords,” said Mr. Trudeau. “When that time comes, who do you want at the negotiation table, standing up to Doug Ford? Andrew Scheer, who follows his lead – or our Liberal team, who will fight for you?”

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new radio ad to highlight the Liberals’ unmatched record when it comes to fighting for workers and protecting Canadian jobs.
“In the NAFTA negotiations, our Liberal government fought tooth and nail to protect Canadian jobs,” said Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We said we would get a good deal, and that’s exactly what we achieved.”
The new NAFTA deal preserves more than $2 billion a day in cross-border trade between Canada and the United States. During negotiations, Andrew Scheer urged Canada to fold to America’s demands — no matter the cost to our economy or middle class workers.
“We stood up to Donald Trump on trade when the Conservatives wanted Canada to back down,” said Chrystia Freeland, Liberal candidate in the Toronto riding of University—Rosedale, in the new ad. “The Conservatives told us to take any deal we could get. Capitulation is not a negotiating strategy.”
The Liberal government stood up for Canadian workers and businesses by:

negotiating strong, enforceable labour and environment chapters in the new NAFTA that will protect our workers and our environment;
securing market access for Canadian car and car parts manufacturers, which protects our auto industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports; and
successfully removing unfair section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, which put more than 33,500 Canadian jobs at risk.

“We believe in the strength of Canadian workers, and in our country’s resolve to unite against anyone who would put middle class jobs — and the communities who rely on those jobs — at risk,” added Mr. Trudeau.

“Conservatives say they’re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy, and cut services for everybody else,” says Navdeep Bains
Ottawa, ON – Today, the Hon. Navdeep Bains shared a video of Andrew Scheer speaking about his plan to subsidize wealthy private schools with hundreds of millions of federal tax dollars, and highlighted how this plan would take us backward to the failed Conservative policies of the past.
“Great public schools are the bedrock of Canada’s economy,” Bains said. “The Conservatives don’t get that. That’s why they’d weaken public education with a reckless plan to fund private schools and homeschooling, as this video makes clear.”
“Conservatives say they’re for the people, then they cut taxes for the wealthy, and cut services for everybody else. We’re for moving forward – for everyone.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on World Mental Health Day:
“Kids and parents. Friends and loved ones. Colleagues at work and folks in our communities. Mental health affects all of us – and that’s why we need to talk about it. Having an honest conversation, sharing our stories with compassion and openness – these are ways we can make it easier for people to reach out and get the help they need. Yet too often, fear of stigma makes people suffer in silence. World Mental Health Day is a chance to change that.
This year, World Mental Health Day focuses on suicide prevention. No family should have to go through losing a loved one to suicide. No one should have to feel hopeless because they can’t get the support they need. That’s why we’re going to set clear national standards for access to mental health services – to make sure every Canadian can get quality support quickly, when they need it most.
In Canada, too many Indigenous communities lose young people, elders, parents, and friends to suicide. Over the last four years, we’ve made important progress through initiatives like the Inuit-led National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy, but much more needs to be done. Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will work together with Indigenous peoples to create distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation, to make sure Indigenous communities have access to high quality, culturally-relevant health care and mental health services.
We’ve made mental health a priority because no one should ever have to suffer in silence. Yet too many Canadians go through these struggles without the help they need – and that’s especially true for veterans. That’s unacceptable, and that’s why we will make sure every veteran has access to high quality mental health care, when and where they need it. We will move forward with a new rapid-response service, and we will reach out to every Canadian veteran to make sure they know about the help available. We will also make it easier for veterans to get disability benefits, and give our veterans up to $3,000 in additional free counselling services before a disability claim is required.
In the past four years, our Liberal government has made major strides to advance mental health. We made Canada’s largest-ever investment in mental health, and working with the provinces and territories, we made mental health a key priority in our health accords for the first time in Canadian history.
But this is just the beginning, and we’re going to keep building on our work. A re-elected Liberal government will include mental health as a specific element of occupational health and safety in the Canada Labour Code. Understanding that addiction is closely tied to mental health, we will invest to help more people access the addiction treatment services they need. We will also strengthen support for LGBTQ2 communities, including by further investing in the mental health crisis hotline we launched earlier this year.
No matter who we are or what we do, there is no shame in struggling with a mental health issue. Mental health affects all of us, whether someone we love is suffering or we’ve gone through these struggles ourselves. Let’s work together to break down stigma, move forward, and build a healthier Canada for everyone.”

Ottawa, ON – In response to Andrew Scheer’s fake climate plan, Catherine McKenna, Liberal M.P. for Ottawa Centre, released the following statement:
“It has been 416 days since Andrew Scheer promised a climate plan. There is a reason he waited until the last hours of this Parliament. He wanted nobody around to debate ideas that will cost Canadians more while doing less to protect our environment and the future for our kids.
“The Conservatives are ignoring the smartest companies and leading economists who tell us fighting climate change is a recipe for global stability and economic success. Extreme weather events are increasing in severity and costs are spiraling. All the while, Conservative politicians like Jason Kenney and Doug Ford make cuts to flood and wildfire management programs and do less to fight pollution.
“Canadians want an ambitious and sensible climate plan that keeps a healthy economy growing while tackling emissions at home and with partners around the world. Not a return to the failed policies of the past, written by fringe oil lobbyists who want to have unlimited pipelines and to gut environmental protections and shut down public input. Unfortunately, that is what the Conservatives want Canadians to accept.”

MONTREAL, QC – Tonight, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, presented an ambitious plan to strengthen the middle class, protect the environment and grow the economy. In a few weeks, Canadians will have a choice: go back to the cuts and austerity of the Harper years, or move forward for a better future.
“We have to move forward because our planet is burning. We have to move forward because people are having a hard time making ends meet. We have to move forward because our culture, and fundamental rights like gender equality, are under threat,” said Justin Trudeau. “And to do so, we need to have Quebec represented in government.”
The debate made one thing clear: Andrew Scheer and Conservatives like Doug Ford and Jason Kenney have no plan for the environment. They reject science and want to go back to a time when pollution was free. Liberals know climate change is real, and we’re putting in place concrete solutions to fight the climate crisis, adapt to a warming planet, and protect our environment.
Justin Trudeau also underscored that a re-elected Liberal government will continue to invest in Canada’s cultural and creative industries. We will increase funding for Telefilm Canada, strengthen the regional mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada, and move forward with legislation to ensure internet giants promote Canadian content. Andrew Scheer will cut taxes for the wealthy by cutting funding for Canada’s cultural industry – just like Stephen Harper.
The debate was also a reminder that the Liberal Party is the party of Francophones. Andrew Scheer refused to stand up to Doug Ford when he cut services for Franco-Ontarians. He’s already shown us that he won’t defend Francophone rights.
Justin Trudeau also stressed that a diverse and open Canada is a stronger Canada. New Canadians help our communities succeed, and they also help address the labour shortage that threatens the growth of our economy.
“In a few weeks, Quebecers — and all Canadians — will have a choice. We can choose a party that’s unwilling to move forward, because it doesn’t share our values. We can choose a party that’s unable to move forward, because it’s aiming for the opposition. Or we can choose the Liberal party, and keep moving forward – for the environment, the middle class, and our fundamental rights. On October 21st, let’s choose forward, together.”

Ottawa, ON — On the debate stage tonight, Justin Trudeau proved that the Liberal plan is the only credible choice for Canadians who want more money in their pockets, a cleaner environment, and safer communities.
Andrew Scheer spent the entire night attacking Justin Trudeau, while Mr. Trudeau stayed focused on what matters most — giving more help to the middle class and the people working hard to join it.
“Canadians want to know why Andrew Scheer is offering millionaires a $50,000 tax break, and 17 billion dollars in cuts for everybody else,” said Mr. Trudeau.
Andrew Scheer doubled down on his flawed plan to give tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthiest one per cent. Our plan will lower taxes for those who need a break, saving middle class families almost $600 a year, without giving a cent to millionaires.
The debate also showed Canadians once again that the Conservatives have no plan to fight climate change. Andrew Scheer made it clear that he doesn’t think it’s possible to grow the economy and fight climate change. The first thing he would do — his first action as Prime Minister — would be to tear up our plan to fight climate change, taking back the money we’ve put in Canadians’ pockets. He is wrong. We will create jobs, reduce pollution, and leave a healthier planet for our kids and grandkids.
“Conservative premiers have gotten elected on promises to do nothing on climate change, and we need a strong federal government to fight them to make sure we are moving forward on protecting future generations from climate change,” said Mr. Trudeau.
Tonight’s debate made the thing crystal clear: the other parties are either unable — or unwilling — to move us forward. Only Liberals have the plan, and the team, to keep Canada moving forward, for everyone.

Ottawa, ON – In October, Canadians have a choice to make about the future of our country: keep moving forward and building on the progress we’ve made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years.
In 2015, after a decade of failed Conservative policy, Canada’s economy was sputtering. Economic growth, job creation, and wages were all stalled – thanks to a Conservative government that believed you could cut your way to prosperity.
“Canadians were tired of a Harper government that promised prosperity, and delivered the opposite. So in 2015, they chose a team that was willing to invest in people and their communities. We live in the best country in the world, but better is always possible,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “And while there’s more work ahead of us than behind us, we have spent the last four years building toward better – and we’ve got the record to show for it.”
Over the last four years, our Liberal government made investments that made a real difference in people’s lives:

We’ve put more money in people’s pockets by cutting taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest one percent;
We stopped sending child benefit cheques to millionaires, so we could send more to the single parent working two jobs, and to the family of five that falls a bit short at the end of the month;
We made the Canada Pension Plan even stronger, because in a country like ours, seniors shouldn’t struggle to make ends meet; and
We’re protecting our nature, and ensuring that our air stays clean and our water stays safe – because we owe it to our kids, and to ourselves, to take care of our environment.

Since 2015, Canadians have created over a million new jobs. The new Canada Child Benefit is helping parents pay for healthier groceries, summer camp, and school supplies. We’ve lifted 900,000 Canadians out of poverty – and that includes over 300,000 kids. And this fall, Canadians once again get to vote for the kind of Canada they want to live in.
“Conservatives like to say they’re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Our government has chosen to move Canada forward by investing in families, workers, and communities. On October 21st, let’s stand united, and let’s choose forward – for a stronger middle class, and for a better Canada for all Canadians.”

For many Jewish Canadians, Yom Kippur comes during a difficult year. In the wake of violent acts of hatred in Canada and beyond, this is a time to recommit to fighting antisemitism, hatred, and discrimination in every form. These acts have no place in our country or our world, and we must always stand united against them. Together, we can continue to build a more inclusive Canada where we celebrate the diversity that is our strength.

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Thanksgiving:
“Happy Thanksgiving!
Life can be hectic for all of us. And whether you’re holding it down in the kitchen or getting outside with the family, Thanksgiving is about slowing down and appreciating what really matters – like family, and friends we haven’t seen in a long time, but we pick right back up where we left off.
Thanksgiving is a chance to say thank you to the people who make a difference – whether it’s the service members who keep us safe, or our neighbour a few doors down who keeps the driveways plowed.
No one’s worried about the little things when there’s pumpkin pie to focus on. And what brings us together is so much bigger than what pulls us apart – from Canadian values, to universal health care, to the start of the hockey season. Wherever we are, being together is what counts.
We have a whole lot to be grateful for. After all, Canada’s home. We’ve got to take care of it. And that’s exactly what our team is going to do – whether it’s fighting climate change, supporting families, or putting more money in the pockets of the middle class.
On October 21st, the choice could not be more clear. So let’s do what Canadians always do. Let’s pull together and move forward.
From our family to yours, have a great Thanksgiving.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Persons Day:
“Emily Murphy. Nellie McClung. Irene Parlby. Louise McKinney. Henrietta Muir Edwards. Known as the Famous Five, this group of determined Alberta women fought for years to gain women the right to serve as senators and be recognized as ‘persons’ under the law. They came together to challenge the status quo and push for a government that reflected the country it served.
On Persons Day, we celebrate the anniversary of a landmark victory for women’s rights and a turning point for democracy in Canada. The 1929 ruling opened the door to further progress, lending momentum to future generations who would continue to push for a more equal world.
Persons Day falls during Women’s History Month – a reminder that women have fought for change in the past, and continue to do so today. Advocates are carrying this work forward, and over the last four years, our Liberal government has stood with them. Whether it’s introducing Canada’s first gender-equal Cabinet, helping more women start their own business, combatting gender-based violence, or investing in education for the world’s most vulnerable women and girls, we’ve worked to move the dial on gender equality and build a more just, equal Canada for everyone. And from breaking down barriers in the workforce by offering guaranteed paid family leave, to investing in the organizations that fight for gender equality each day, we will keep putting gender equality at the heart of everything we do.
The Famous Five’s story also teaches us that we have to keep pushing forward – especially when the going gets tough. In 2019, we’ve seen an attack on women’s rights around the world, from the legitimization of gender-based violence, to the assault on a woman’s right to choose. Even in Canada, some politicians are intent on rolling back rights and cutting access to important services like health care and sexual assault centres. We can’t afford to lose ground on gender equality – but Persons Day shows us that if we work together, we can win the hardest battles. Today, let’s come together for a more equal world, and choose forward, for all of us.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on National Seniors Day:
“On National Seniors Day, we celebrate the people who have made Canada the place we know and love. Parents and grandparents, neighbours and friends – Canada’s seniors built this country, and their hard work and vision continue to lift our communities up. Whether it’s helping neighbours in need, or being there for us in the tough moments, seniors make Canada stronger every day.
Seniors have spent a lifetime helping others, and deserve to enjoy their golden years in comfort and dignity. Over the last four years, our Liberal government took action to make that a reality for seniors across Canada.
After the Harper government announced they would raise the age of eligibility for Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement to 67, we brought it back down to 65. We strengthened the Canada Pension Plan. And for the most vulnerable seniors, we boosted the Guaranteed Income Supplement – because no one, of any age, should have to worry about making ends meet.
We also invested in home care, and created the Canada Caregiver Credit to provide simpler and better support for people taking care of a loved one. And with a new Minister of Seniors, we are making sure the perspectives and needs of older Canadians are front and centre.
We know there is still more to do so that all seniors enjoy the secure retirement they deserve. Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will increase Old Age Security by an extra ten per cent at the age of 75, and will boost the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit by 25 per cent. These changes will help lift thousands of seniors out of poverty, and support people after they have lost a loved one.
Together, let’s choose forward, and keep working to make life better for people of every age, from coast to coast to coast. Today, let’s celebrate the seniors in our lives, and thank them for all that they have done, and all that they continue to do.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day of Peace:
“Today, on the International Day of Peace, we celebrate global efforts to make peace a reality around the world. We honour the advocates who are on the frontlines of that work, and come together to build a more just, equal, and peaceful future.
This year’s theme, ‘Climate Action for Peace,’ reminds us that there’s no peace without justice – and no justice without climate justice. We’re all connected, and lasting, sustainable peace must include fighting the climate crisis and building more equal, resilient communities around the world.
Canada has a long and proud history as a voice for human rights around the globe, and a leader in international efforts to advance peace. Since 2015, Canada has made major strides to build on that leadership. Canadian peacekeepers have served in UN missions from Mali to Uganda to Haiti, helping communities around the globe build lasting peace and security. In 2017, Canada led the creation of the Vancouver Principles – now endorsed by nearly 100 countries – to end the recruitment and use of child soldiers and protect children around the globe.
When women participate meaningfully in peace processes, they help build more lasting peace. That’s why, together with our UN partners, we launched the Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace Operations, to boost women’s participation in conflict prevention, stabilization, and peacebuilding efforts. And last year, together with our partners, we delivered a historic investment in women and girls’ education in crisis and conflict situations – the largest of its kind ever made.
There’s much more to be done, and all of us have a role to play to build a more just and equal world, and a more peaceful, prosperous future. Together, let’s choose forward, advance peace and justice, and make our world a better one – today, and for generations to come.”

Québec City, QC – As Andrew Scheer launches his campaign in Québec, Pablo Rodriguez and Diane Lebouthilier, Québec Campaign Co-Chairs, issued the following statement:
“Andrew Scheer is launching his campaign today in Trois-Rivières, but Québecers know that Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives, just like those of Stephen Harper, do not share their priorities.
Environment
“Québecers know that urgent action is needed to combat climate change. The Conservatives have delivered a bogus plan that would take Canada backward on its environmental responsibilities by eliminating the price on pollution and doing everything to please oil lobbyists.
Economy
“Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives will make deep cuts to services on which Québecers depend. For our part, we introduced the Canada Child Benefit, which gives more money to 9 out of 10 Canadian families; cut taxes for the middle class while raising taxes on the wealthiest 1% of Canadians; and lowered taxes for small businesses.
Free Trade
“On the NAFTA file, Andrew Scheer advocated for total surrender. His pandering would have meant a dismantling of supply management in the dairy industry, an end to the exemption that protects Québec culture, and the elimination of all possible recourse for the Québec softwood lumber industry against the Americans.
“On the topic of unfair and illegal tariffs on US imports of Canadian aluminum, the Conservatives demanded that we drop our retaliatory measures without any concessions from the Americans. We stood strong for our workers and negotiated an agreement to lift these tariffs.
Local Infrastructure
“We invested more than 70 million dollars to support a high-frequency rail project for the Québec City-Toronto corridor by way of Trois-Rivières. For his part, Andrew Scheer promised to eliminate the infrastructure bank that finances the study of this project.
Culture
“For 10 years, the Scheer and Harper Conservatives made cuts to our culture. They made cuts to Radio-Canada, our official languages, and critical funding for our artists and creators. Québecers remember the war the Conservatives waged against the cultural community.
“In 2015, we promised to repair the damage. Since that time, we have made the largest ever reinvestment in culture.
“On October 21, let’s choose forward. Justin Trudeau’s team will work hard for you and with you.”

“Today, we join Armenian communities across Canada and around the world to celebrate the anniversary of Armenia’s independence.
Canada and Armenia are bound by shared values of justice, democracy, and freedom, as well as our work together in international organizations like La Francophonie.
Last year, I had the chance to visit Armenia and meet with Prime Minister Pashinyan to discuss further strengthening our bilateral relationship through travel, tourism, and trade. The visit shone a light on the close ties between Canadians and Armenians – ties that are at the heart of our relationship.
In Canada, we know that diversity is our strength, and every day, the 60,000-strong Armenian Canadian community contributes to our country’s success. When Armenian Canadians welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees, they showed the way forward with compassion and generosity. We share a commitment to the successful settlement and integration of all newcomers.
On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish a happy Armenian Independence Day to everyone celebrating.”

St. John’s, NL – A re-elected Liberal government will put more money in parents’ pockets to help them in the first year of their children’s lives.
Nothing is more important to parents than spending time with their kids. But raising a family isn’t cheap, and the bills pile up early on – when parents are being paid less but baby products and child care cost more.
“Every parent knows that raising kids is expensive – especially in that first year,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “With everything else on their plates, the last thing new parents need to worry about is making ends meet. That’s why we’ll be there for families – so they can be there for their kids.”
A re-elected Liberal government will:

give up to $1,000 more to families to help when the costs of raising kids are highest, by boosting the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) by 15 per cent for children under the age of one;
make sure families get more money right away, by making maternity and parental benefits tax-free; and
make paid leave fairer for families, by introducing a 15-week leave for adoptive parents – so they get as much in benefits to care for their kids as everyone else.

These important steps will build toward a long-term vision that helps families when it matters most.
That’s why we will, within the first year of our mandate, work to establish Guaranteed Paid Family leave – an ambitious program that will make sure that parents who don’t qualify for paid leave through Employment Insurance or don’t get enough, because they’re between jobs, earn little, or haven’t worked enough hours, will receive a guaranteed income during the first year of their child’s life. This means every single Canadian parent will be able to afford to spend the first year at home with their kid.
Since 2015, our government has made it a priority to make life easier and more affordable for families:

We gave more money to nine out of ten families and helped lift 300,000 children from poverty, by creating the CCB;
We created tens of thousands of new child care spaces across the country, by developing the Early Learning and Child Care framework;
We made parental leave more flexible, by allowing parents to spread their time over 18 months; and
We gave both parents the option to take more time off with their newborn, by adding the five-week parental sharing benefit.

“Conservatives like Andrew Scheer and Doug Ford pretend they are for the people, but on the first opportunity, they cut taxes for the wealthiest and cut the help Canadian families rely on,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Our kids deserve the best possible start in life – and that’s exactly what today is all about.”

Waterloo, ON – A re-elected Liberal government will help up to 250,000 more public school kids get a spot in before and after-school programs and nearly double federal spending on child care.
Kids across Canada are heading back to school this month. But for many families with elementary school children, finding a spot in before and after school care programs will be difficult and expensive. In 2019, less than one in three elementary school kids will be able to get a space — and in Ontario, for families lucky enough to get a spot, it will cost them more than $4,000 this year. Meanwhile, parents who work late shifts or irregular hours have even fewer child care options. Since child care still falls disproportionately to women, moms are too often left to shoulder the responsibility.
“Parents shouldn’t have to worry about finding quality child care that won’t break the bank. But for too many families, getting their kids the care they need is challenging and expensive. That’s unacceptable,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Today, we’re investing to create hundreds of thousands of new before and after school spaces and lower the costs of child care for families.”
A re-elected Liberal government will help parents with elementary school kids by doing the following:

We will create up to 250,000 more before and after school spaces for kids under the age of ten;
We will put $800 back into the pockets of the average Ontario family of four — every year — by lowering parents’ fees by ten percent across the country. More than one million families will benefit;
We will dedicate a portion of the new spaces to provide more child care options for parents who work overtime, late shifts, or multiple jobs so they can count on help when they need it most.

We will do this by nearly doubling the federal support we provide to the provinces and territories through the Early Learning and Child Care Framework, investing at least $535 million more each year.
These measures build on four years of Liberal investments in child care and families, including:

the Canada Child Benefit, which — in addition to investments in child care — is putting more money in the pockets of nine out of ten families to help with the high cost of raising kids. Since 2015, the CCB has helped lift more than 300,000 Canadian kids out of poverty;
the Early Learning and Child Care Framework, which invested $7.5 billion dollars to create tens of thousands of new child care spaces around the country; and
a commitment to develop an additional 40,000 high quality and affordable learning spaces each year, rising to 100,000 by 2030.

“Just like Stephen Harper, Andrew Scheer’s idea of helping families is to give tax cuts to those who attend private schools,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Canadian families need high quality, affordable child care solutions, not tax breaks for the wealthy at everyone else’s expense. Liberals have a real plan to make smart investments now, so that families can get the care they need for their kids, and help them get the best start possible in life.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day of the Girl:
“Girls are taking this world by storm. They’re climate leaders. Voices for justice. Entrepreneurs transforming our communities. Artists telling our stories.
On International Day of the Girl, we celebrate girls and young women everywhere. And we come together to promote girls’ rights, and break down the barriers that still hold girls back. Around the globe, girls are leading that charge – fighting for what they believe in, making their voices heard.
Over the last four years, our Liberal government has made major strides to support girls everywhere, and that’s what we’ll continue to do. Under our G7 presidency, we worked with partners to announce a historic investment of $3.8 billion in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations – the largest of its kind ever made. This past summer, we announced another unprecedented investment – this time, to defend the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls globally. And a few weeks ago, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will commit at least ten per cent of our international assistance to education, and lead global efforts to make sure kids growing up in refugee or displacement camps get the education they need and deserve.
We’re working just as hard to support girls and young women growing up in Canada. We will make it easier for young women to pay for post-secondary education by increasing Canada Student Grants by 40 per cent, and by giving students a full two years after graduating before they need to start paying off their student loans – interest free. We’ve worked to eliminate the gender gap in the workforce, from creating pay equity legislation, to launching the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, to helping more women start a career in the trades. We’ve made it a top priority to end violence against women and girls, through the Strategy to Prevent and End Gender-Based Violence and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. We’ve all got to be allies to girls, because building a better world starts there.
To girls in Canada and around the world: there are going to be people out there who try to stand in your way. And that is simply because they’re afraid of your power – power you show us every day when you challenge us to do better. But there will always be more of us who are here to stand with you and help you create the future you want to see. So don’t hold back, and don’t let anyone stop you. You can do anything you set your mind to. Chase down your dreams, because this is your world.
Girls are the future, and the future starts today.”

2019 English-language Leaders Debate
Tonight, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau presented to Canadians his plan to continue investing in our middle class, grow the economy, and protect the environment. Here is what some people are saying about tonight’s debate:
Quotations are included in their original language
HOST: T“So let’s talk, very quickly, who won this debate? Who impressed you the most?” TOM MULCAIR: “I think that clearly Justin Trudeau, once again, because nobody was able to score a knockout, comes ahead on points.” – Tom Mulcair, CTV News, 7 October, 2019”
“Trudeau has managed to avoid becoming the centre of attacks tonight which is very interesting.” – Mercedes Stephenson (Global), Twitter, 7 October 2019
“@JustinTrudeau gets to outline some of his biggest accomplishments on bringing 900 000 people out of poverty and creates over a million jobs.” – Evan Solomon (CTV), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Trudeau coming out strong. On Bernier: “You say publicly what Scheer thinks privately.” Say what you will about Trudeau but he just accurately described the right in this country in one sentence.” – Samantha Emann (Hamilton Spectator), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Trudeau réussit à lancer une barbe à Scheer en parlant à Bernier: Vous dites tout haut ce que M. Scheer dit tout bas.” – Christopher G. Nardi (Journal de Montréal), Twitter, 7 octobre, 2019
« J’ai eu l’impression que [Trudeau] était plus précis dans ses réponses aussi. On avait plus de détails sur ses intentions et son bilan. » – Geneviève Tellier (professeure, Université d’Ottawa), RDI, 7 octobre 2019
“Trudeau makes a good point here, Singh still not addressing Bill 21.” – Ben o’Hara-Byrne, CHEK TV, Twitter, October 7, 2019
« Trudeau répond que comme premier ministre, il faut défendre les emplois. Il attaque Scheer en disant qu’il n’a pas déposé de plateforme et qu’il veut faire des compressions comme Doug Ford. » – Philippe-Vincent Foisy (Radio-Canada), Twitter, 7 octobre, 2019
« Blanchet qui utilise le segment sur les affaires autochtones pour parler juste du Québec. Pas fort. On en a aussi au Québec, des Premières nations. » – Mathieu Charlebois (L’Actualité), Twitter, 2 octobre, 2019
“Bernier asks if Scheer thinks he could impose [a] pipeline through Quebec, even if the province doesn’t want it. Bernier says he would impose it, and Scheer doesn’t have the courage to say that too.” – Alex Ballingall (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Shameless of Scheer to call PM “phony” and a “fraud” when he kept his dual passport a secret until forced to acknowledge.” – Damien Cox (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Scheer says that he would pay for his tax cuts and credits by cutting foreign aid and ending (some) corporate welfare. That’s misleading. Those two savings equal ~$3 billion a year. Scheer’s proposed income tax cut alone costs ~$6 billion a year.” – Alex Boutilier (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Claim: Trudeau says “We eliminated 87 long-term boil-water advisories in Indigenous communities and are on schedule to lift all that remain.” Verdict: True (to date). There were 105 long-term boil-water advisories on reserves when Trudeau took office. According to Indigenous Services Canada, as of Sept. 3, 2019, 87 have been eliminated. Budget 2019 provided $739 million over five years, and said it was on track to eliminate all by 2019.” – Hadyn Watters, CBC, October 7, 2019

On the Friday before the Thanksgiving long weekend, after all the Leaders’ debates have passed, and after thousands of Canadians have already cast their ballot, Andrew Scheer finally released his platform, which includes $53 billion in cuts, including $14 billion in hidden cuts.
Canadians have nothing to thank Andrew Scheer for this Thanksgiving. Here’s what people are saying about Andrew Scheer’s reckless plan:
Quotations are included in their original language
“Well this is incompetent. Infrastructure spending desperately needs to go up, not down.” – Emmett Macfarlane (University of Waterloo), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“What party releases its platform the Friday of a long weekend? One that doesn’t want too much attention focused on it would be my guess.” – Gary Mason (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Over and over again, Conservatives have demonstrated hostility towards Canada’s workers. Today, Andrew Scheer is doubling down on that hostility and seeking a mandate to cut. With a platform loaded with job-killing service cuts, it’s clear that Andrew Scheer represents an equal threat to Canadians as Stephen Harper.” – Hassan Yussuff (President of the Canadian Labour Congress), October 12, 2019
« Un gouvernement conservateur imposerait des compressions budgétaires de plusieurs dizaines de milliards de dollars dans son premier mandat. » – Philippe-Vincent Foisy et Hugo Prévost (Radio-Canada), 11 octobre, 2019
“Cities and communities across the country have an urgent need for increased investment in infrastructure. Proposed measures in this platform appear to move in the opposite direction, with fewer infrastructure dollars available year-over-year to create jobs, improve roads and bridges, and maintain the local services Canadians rely on.” – Bill Karsten (President of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities), October 11, 2019
« Assurément, pour que Montréal puisse poursuivre son élan, les partis doivent accroître leurs investissements en matière d’infrastructures et de transports en commun, notamment pour la ligne rose » – Cabinet de la Ville de Montréal (Le Devoir), 12 octobre 2019
“If what you seek is a coherent vision of conservatism in the 21st century, you will have to look elsewhere.” – Andrew Coyne (National Post), October 11, 2019
“The largest cuts are in unspecified “other operating expenses” – $14.4 billion over five years. The Conservatives suggest they can achieve that through reining in travel spending, consulting fees, and cutting down on federal office space.” – Alex Boutilier (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The second largest proposed spending cut in the platform is a plan to save $14-billion over five years on federal government operating expenses, which are not detailed in the platform.” – Marieke Walsh (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
« Ces coupes seraient plus importantes que celles du gouvernement Harper dans les années 2010 et représentent des « risques significatifs », selon l’Institut des finances publiques et de la démocratie. » – Vincent Brousseau-Pouliot (La Presse), 12 octobre 2019
“The party said shrinking the size of cubicle space for public servants could be one of the ways to save that money.” – Marieke Walsh (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The single biggest saving measure is putting off some infrastructure spending. That will save $18-billion over five years.” – David Akin (Global), Twitter, October 11, 2019
« On savait déjà que M. Scheer voulait sabrer les subventions aux entreprises et l’aide étrangère, afin de récupérer au total 3 milliards de dollars par année. On sait maintenant où il ira chercher les dizaines de milliards additionnels qui lui manquaient pour remiser l’encre rouge. Ainsi, M. Scheer propose d’amputer 18 milliards de dollars au cours des cinq prochaines années des budgets d’infrastructures. » – Hélène Buzzetti et Marie Vastel (Le Devoir), 12 octobre 2019
“Now we see why this was released late on a Friday before a long weekend. Some big cuts with few specifics.” – Don Martin (CTV News), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The Conservative plan to balance the budget includes some serious cuts, including: – Cutting $1.5 billion a year by reviewing business subsidy programs -“Prioritizing” infrastructure spending, which would eliminate $1.3 billion in 2020-21 – Cutting foreign aid by $1.5 billion” – Rachel Gilmore (CTV News), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The Conservative platform has no mention of pharmacare or a new general national prescription drug plan. Earlier this year, the Conservative health critic suggested to media they would have a plan that would fill in the gaps for people w/o insurance. It’s not there” – Cormac Mac Sweeney (CityNews), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Vote for me and I’ll shrink your cubicle!” – Stephen Maher (Maclean’s), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Canadian govt controls 38,341 buildings. If Conservatives seriously want to pare back this number, they’ll start with, um, military. Smaller barracks? Munitions bunk beds?” – Jason Markusoff (Maclean’s), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“I’ve avoided the Doug Ford – Andrew Scheer comparisons because they’re definitely different people but the details coming out about the CPC fiscal plans, particularly on the cutting side, are eerily Ford-esque.” – Emmett Macfarlane (University of Waterloo), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“No #pharmacare plan; no plan to take on Big Pharma and reduce prescription drug costs. So much for @CPC_HQ and @AndrewScheer ‘putting everyday Canadians first’.” – Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, Twitter, October 11, 2019
“I think the prospect of the Conservatives saving $22 billion from “operating reductions” or $11 billion from cracking down on tax cheats is as likely to succeed as Scheer ordering the Salish Sea to reverse itself.” – John Ivison (National Post), October 12, 2019
« Le retour à l’équilibre budgétaire ne se fera pas sans compressions. Andrew Scheer prévoit couper dans les investissements en infrastructures à hauteur de 18 G$ sur cinq ans. À cela s’ajoutent 14 G$ en réduction des dépenses de fonctionnement… » – Guillaume St-Pierre (Journal de Montréal), 12 octobre 2019
“Tory costing of a carbon tax repeal. Apparently over five years, the net cost to the Government of giving up THIS MASSIVE TAX HIKE TAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF CANADIANS’ POCKETS is actually only about $180M. Imagine that.” – Alex Usher (Higher Education Strategy Associates), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The Conservative party says it will cut $18-billion in infrastructure spending days after Mr. Scheer criticized the Liberals for not spending enough on infrastructure.” – Denise Balkissoon (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“There’s about $53 million in cuts, so changes that [the Conservatives] say are savings but are essentially cuts to different programs.” – Annie Bergeron Oliver (CTV Power Play), October 11, 2019
“Friday afternoon release, just ahead of a long weekend, that usually means bad news and the conservative blueprint for governing which came out less than an hour ago shows some startling ways to cut spending that had not been disclosed before.” – Don Martin (CTV Power Play), October 11, 2019
“This is Harper’s cuts on steroids. It’s going to hurt Canadians and the public services they rely on. Once again, Conservatives are trying to eliminate the evidence that’s required to create sound policy for all of Canada.” – Debi Daviau (President of Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada), Twitter, October 11, 2019
« Les troupes de M. Scheer comptent prioriser les dépenses faites par le fédéral en infrastructure, apprend-on dans le cadre financier des conservateurs. Ces derniers entendent ainsi aller chercher 1,3 milliard $ dès 2020-2021. Au terme de cinq ans, les conservateurs pensent ainsi pouvoir mettre de côté un total de 18 milliards $. Ce montant élevé a surpris l’experte en finances publiques Geneviève Tellier, de l’Université d’Ottawa. «C’est quand même majeur. Il va y avoir des projets qui n’auront pas lieu», croit-elle. » – Émilie Bergeron (TVA Nouvelles), 11 octobre 2019
“I think there are a lot of people and economists questioning whether this budget is putting too much emphasis on trying to find savings of balancing the budget instead of putting money into the economy.” – Annie Bergeron Oliver (CTV Power Play), October 11, 2019
“[The Conservatives] are going to have to lay off public services to get those sorts of savings.” – Kevin Page (Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy), CBC Power & Politics, Twitter, October 11, 2019
“@CPC_HQ costed platform has no funding for a national dementia strategy. We’ve asked @AndrewScheer how his party, if elected, will meet the government’s statutory obligation to implement a national strategy, without funding? “ – Dementia Justice, Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Andrew Scheer is promising to slash infrastructure spending… The Conservatives employed a series of fictions to pretend the infrastructure cuts – the single largest budget-balancing measure in the Conservative platform – aren’t really cuts.” – Campbell Clark (Globe and Mail), October 11, 2019
“I’ve read the Conservative Party platform and am disappointed to not see any direct mention of First Nations people. Increased investments are critical to First Nations’ success, which is why the Conservatives need to publicly explain how they will support our priorities. First Nations priorities are Canada’s priorities, and if focused on and implemented they will result in a better Canada for everyone.” – Perry Bellegarde, National Chief, Assembly of First Nations, Twitter, October 11, 2019
« Les conservateurs repoussent les projets d’infrastructure pour atteindre l’équilibre » – La Presse Canadienne, 11 octobre 2019
“The Conservatives intend to make major spending cuts, if elected.” – John Ivison (National Post), October 12, 2019
“Conservative leader Andrew Scheer revealing election platform in Delta— the key is how he plans to bring the budget back to balance in five years. That involves $53-billion in cuts.” – Martin MacMahon (NEWS 1130), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“On the Manitoba side, the federal Tory platform doesn’t mention Manitoba Hydro at all in talk of the electricity corridor (hydro and pipeline right-of-way). Quebec gets even more sway in immigration but nothing about boosting the provincial-nominee quota despite MB seeking more.” – Dylan Robertson (Winnipeg Free Press), Twitter, October 11, 2019

Ottawa, ON – Liberals released a new video today revealing Andrew Scheer briefed Conservatives about his deep cuts plan at a private meeting, including how he’ll conceal it during the election campaign.
Link: https://twitter.com/Bill_Morneau/status/1171065033889112064?s=20
“When it comes making tough decisions and cuts, I do agree that it’s very important. But we also have to be very, very careful how we communicate that to people. We do have to win the next election in 2019 and there are examples when Conservative parties go in and have a very hard-edged tone to it. We can make the case for spending cuts, absolutely.”
(Andrew Scheer, Conservative Leadership Candidate Meeting, Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, September 7, 2016)
“Andrew Scheer is committed to austerity and cuts, and he is purposely downplaying his cuts plan in order to get elected. Scheer said so to Conservatives at a private event,” said Liberal MP Bill Morneau. “Scheer’s plan to downplay his plan for deep cuts won’t work because Canadians know that Conservatives say they’re for the people, then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else.”
“What Andrew Scheer is saying in this video is exactly what Doug Ford did. Ford said one thing during the election, then made cuts to schools, libraries, public health agencies, and francophone services,” said Morneau. “Scheer has promised the same timelines for cuts as Doug Ford did: five years. Scheer just wont talk about it until after the election.”

Toronto, ON — A re-elected Liberal government will give families an extra $1,500 every year, by cutting taxes for the middle class and lowering cell phone bills by 25 per cent.
Middle class families are feeling stretched. Taxes, fees, and bills pile up while wages are not keeping up. Cell phone bills in particular put a lot of pressure on a family’s budget, with Canadians paying up to twice as much for wireless services than people in other G7 countries. Enough is enough. It’s time for hard-working Canadians to get a bigger share of the pie.
“I’ve been talking to Canadians across the country and I keep hearing the same thing: even with our strong economy and record unemployment, it’s still tough to make ends meet,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Groceries. Cell phone bills. Child care. It all adds up. And that’s what today is all about — being there for families when they need it most.”
To start, a re-elected Liberal government will:

Ensure middle class Canadians, and the people working to join the middle class, pay no federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn — saving the average family $585 in taxes each year;
This means that about 700,000 more Canadians, including seniors and young people starting their careers, will pay no federal tax at all;
And will lift about 40,000 Canadians out of poverty.

This will be done by raising the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) by almost $2,000 for people earning under $147,000 a year.
While Andrew Scheer’s tax plan would give a bigger break to wealthier Canadians, our plan lowers taxes the most for people who make less, helps the middle class, and ensures that the wealthy don’t get an extra hand up. Our tax cut would also help lift twice as many Canadians out of poverty than the Conservatives’.
A re-elected Liberal government will also reduce the cost of wireless services by 25 percent within four years, putting $1,000 back in the pockets of the average Canadian family every year. This will be done by:

Working with telecom companies to offer plans at globally comparable prices;
Encouraging Canadian competition in the market, and allowing the CRTC to step if that competition isn’t leading to lower prices; and
Prioritizing consumer choice and affordability, and not simply the highest bidder, when awarding new wireless expansions.

“The Conservatives spent a decade cutting taxes for corporations and millionaires,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Now, Andrew Scheer’s tax cut would benefit the wealthiest more than those who need it most. We know better. Millionaires don’t need another tax break. But the middle class does.”

Families Can’t Go Four More Years Without Drug and Dental Care NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says charging for medicine means families ‘pay up or get sick’ SASKATOON – Decades of Conservative and Liberal governments siding with big pharma, instead of with everyday Canadians, means families are forced to pay up, or get sick — and families can’t go four more years without drug and dental coverage, said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Because of Justin Trudeau’s choices, there are Canadians who sit at the kitchen table and cut their pills in half to make the bottle last longer,” said Singh. “There are moms and dads who have to make the heartbreaking decision to put off getting their kid’s cavity filled because money’s tight. Families can’t go four more years without the medicine they need. They can’t go four more years without getting their teeth checked.” Rather than expanding health care, the Conservatives would cut and squeeze health care even more. Justin Trudeau promised to help the middle class but did nothing to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, housing or other costs — and, as a result, families are falling further behind. Singh said it’s no surprise Trudeau won’t implement a universal pharmacare plan, since the record shows the Trudeau government has met behind closed doors with pharmaceutical and insurance companies more than 850 times. “No wonder the Liberals have blocked pharmacare and dental coverage. They’re not working for you, and I want people to know that you don’t have to settle for that. No one should have to spend four more years being forced to choose between paying up, or letting their family get sick,” said Singh. “People need a New Deal. Not Conservative cuts that would cost families more and force more folks to end up in jam-packed hospitals. Not a plan to keep protecting the profits of big pharma. A plan to make life affordable and healthy for you and your kids.” Singh’s platform commits to introducing a national universal pharmacare plan by the end of 2020, saving each family more than $500 a year, even if they already have insurance; and a dental plan to provide coverage for millions of families. The NDP’s platform includes a one per cent tax on wealth over $20 million, raising $70 billion over 10 years — funding better, expanded health care. ",2019-10-04 00:00:00

NDP Plan Helps Prevent Gang Crime Jagmeet Singh takes action for people where Justin Trudeau has failed SURREY – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh unveiled his plan today to tackle rising organized crime in B.C. and keep our kids out of gangs, taking action where Liberals have refused to act. “People in Surrey are worried about the future for their kids, but instead of listening, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals chose to spend $4.5 billion of your money on a pipeline while leaving British Columbians to tackle crime alone,” said Singh. “New Democrats have the courage to take a different approach. It’s time to look out for kids and protect our communities from the rising gang violence and organized crime that’s hurting everyday families in B.C.” An NDP government will create a $100 million fund dedicated to helping keep young people out of gangs, with a boost to programs that get youth involved in their community. New Democrats will also immediately create a dedicated RCMP anti-money laundering unit and put an end to hidden corporate ownership of real estate, to help crack down on tax evasion and fraud. “Young people who’ve been left behind need someone on their side. Preventing gang activity and tackling the housing crisis – those are the priorities of families here in Surrey and they need a government in Ottawa that takes them seriously,” said Singh. “We’re replacing empty talk with concrete action, because New Democrats are in it for you.” The NDP’s New Deal for People also gets results for B.C. families by investing in more affordable housing and fighting the climate crisis. New Democrats will safeguard the coast from the increased risk of oil spills, as a result of the high tanker traffic permitted by the Liberals, which would only be worsened by Big Oil-backed Conservatives and the Green Party that won’t rule out supporting them.

Jagmeet Singh Makes Commitments to Fight Climate Change TROIS-RIVIÈRES – New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP MPs Ruth Ellen Brosseau (Berthier-Maskinongé) and Robert Aubin (Trois-Rivières) have committed to moving forward with the high frequency rail project and have promised major investments to help municipalities that were once again impacted by flooding. “Climate change threatens life as we know it. While Justin Trudeau and the Liberals promote their pipeline project, my team and I are presenting a concrete plan to fight climate change with Power to Change: A New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs,” said Singh. “Today, I reiterate my commitment about the high-frequency train project to the people of Trois-Rivières. I want to see a ground-breaking ceremony during the first year of our mandate! We’re also committed to major investments to help flood victims so that our infrastructure can be adapted to this new climate reality.” As proposed by VIA Rail, the high frequency train project will connect Jean Lesage Airport in Quebec City to Toronto, via Trois-Rivières, Montreal, Ottawa, Smith Falls, and Peterborough. It includes a dedicated lane for passenger transport. A high frequency train will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, stimulate regional economic activities, and create numerous quality jobs. In contrast with the Liberal approach, all funding for the NDP project will be public. ""It’s time to invest in projects that fight climate change, not in pipelines that threaten our environment,"" added Aubin. “Justin Trudeau's Liberals talk out of both sides of their mouths when it comes to the environment. As for the Conservatives, they don’t even mention public transit in their climate plan. That’s ridiculous! The NDP is committed to setting up a meeting between VIA Rail, the provinces involved, and key municipal stakeholders within the first 100 days. No more studies, it’s time to act!” Power to Change provides major investments to municipalities in Bethier-Maskinongé that were again impacted by flooding to help them adapt their infrastructure to face this new climate reality. The NDP will invest an additional $2.5 billion to protect people and their property from extreme weather events, such as floods. ""People in my riding were impacted by record floods again this year. Justin Trudeau adopted Stephen Harper’s weak reduction targets and Canada will only reach them 200 years too late.

The difficulties that Groupe Capitales Médias are facing are not isolated, but instead reflect difficulties affecting the entire media industry. The Liberals' inaction over the past four years has put our democracy, the competitiveness of our media companies, and Quebec's cultural distinction at risk. Instead of tackling the problem and putting all media on an equal footing, Justin Trudeau's Liberal government continues to give tax breaks to web giants – corporations that hide their profits in tax havens. The time for rhetoric is over! We need a global solution that also takes regional needs into account. The NDP is the only party standing up and demanding that our traditional media be treated fairly.

After Trudeau tried to spin his record, Spirit said: “I think that I've heard these things before - four years ago actually.” Since Justin Trudeau first promised action four years ago, he: Openly mocked an activist who challenged him on the Liberals’ failure to clean up mercury-contaminated water in Grassy Narrows and fund a care home for poisoning victims;
Refused to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;
Dismissed locally elected Indigenous leaders in Saskatchewan, and said that what Indigenous youth really need is “a place to store their canoes and paddles”;

NDP Will Tax Multimillionaires to Fund Health Care HAMILTON – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is meeting with Canadians struggling with cuts to important services they rely on and the growing cost of health care expenses. Singh is proposing a tax on those with fortunes above $20 million to make sure hardworking Canadians get the services they need like pharmacare and head-to-toe health care. “New Democrats have the courage to make different choices. Unlike the Liberals and Conservatives who work for their rich and powerful friends, we will help people who are struggling to get by,” said Singh. “Our plan is simple – we can afford to help people when we have the courage to ask the super-rich to pay a little bit more to fund the services we all rely on.” For years, Liberals and Conservatives have been helping their corporate friends and the very richest to avoid taxes and hide billions offshore every year. New Democrats will bring in a tax on the multimillionaires alongside tougher enforcement to stop tax evasion both in Canada, and off-shore. “Families shouldn’t have to worry about their future. They deserve a government that is actually on their side. Canadians deserve prescription drugs covered by Medicare, and expanded health care services to cover people head-to-toe – and we can do this when the very richest pay their fair share,” concluded Singh. – 30 – Facts: The NDP’s super-wealth tax would apply a 1% tax on fortunes above $20 million.
This will be applied annually and include real estate, luxury items and investments.
This tax will apply to only the very wealthiest one tenth of one percent of Canadian households.
Over ten years, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates that this tax will raise almost $70 billion, starting with $5.6 billion in 2020-21 and growing to $9.5 billion by 2028-29.
It will be paired with boosted enforcement against tax evasion and penalties for millionaires who try to evade paying taxes, including regular CRA audits and third-party valuation of assets.

Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle Running for the NDP Trudeau let down Indigenous people, says Turtle OTTAWA – Chief Rudy Turtle of Grassy Narrows First Nation will be the NDP’s candidate in Kenora. Turtle and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced Turtle’s candidacy together on Monday in Ottawa. “I’m so proud to welcome Chief Turtle to our team,” said Singh. “Together, we’re going to fight to change the government — from one that works to make life easier for multi-millionaires and big corporations, to one that’s focused on making life better for people, including Indigenous people.” Turtle said he’s running because Justin Trudeau let Indigenous people and nations down, and chose the NDP because Singh and the New Democrats aren’t beholden to wealthy corporate interests. “Justin Trudeau promised us that he’d be different, but what we got was a Prime Minister that says the right thing in public, and does something else behind closed doors,” said Chief Turtle. “When corporations ask Trudeau for something, he goes to great lengths to make their lives easier. When Indigenous communities want to work with Trudeau — on issues from clean water to community safety — we get a condescending Prime Minister who is willing to pose at ceremonies, but not willing to take action to make people’s lives better. Like millions of others, I’m tired of being let down.” Grassy Narrows families have suffered from mercury poisoning because of a corporate chemical-dumping crime that poisoned the English and Wabigoon rivers in the 1960s and ‘70s. The Liberal government promised a much-needed mercury care facility to care for the sickest residents — but has been stalling, trying to get away with delivering much less than promised, or perhaps nothing at all. “I want to join a team that walks the walk of reconciliation,” said Turtle. “Jagmeet and the NDP aren’t here to make life better for multi-millionaires, they’re here to make life better for regular people. In my community, that means taking action to improve health care regardless of where you live, making life more affordable for families, and giving young people the opportunities they need to thrive in the North.” Turtle will be acclaimed as the nominee for Kenora, as the NDP nomination period for the riding has closed.

It’s Time for a New Deal for Northern Ontario Decades of Liberal and Conservative neglect of the North have hurt people. The NDP has a plan to make life more affordable for Northerners. SUDBURY – Today, NDP candidates Charlie Angus (Timmins-James Bay), Carol Hughes (Algoma–Manitoulin–Kapuskasing), Beth Mairs (Sudbury), Stef Paquette (Nickel Belt) and Rob Boulet (Nipissing-Timiskaming) announced a New Deal for Northern Ontario. For far too long, Northerners have been finding it harder to make ends meet. The Liberal and Conservative policies failed to address the significant challenges people face in the region, and the NDP knows it is time to do things differently. “Northern families are struggling to make ends meet while the Liberals are looking out for their corporate friends,” said Hughes. “In a country as rich as Canada, we need to do better, and we can do better. Liberals and Conservatives haven’t worked for us. Only Northern Ontario New Democrats have a plan to make life more affordable, advance reconciliation, and create jobs for the region.” Trudeau’s Liberals haven’t worked for Northern Ontario – they’ve made life more expensive and haven’t done enough on climate and to deliver better services for Indigenous communities. Andrew Scheer is just more of the same of what the North has gotten from Stephen Harper and Doug Ford – cuts to the services people need. “Both the Liberals and Conservatives have undermined the economic development of Northern Ontario by refusing to invest in FedNor and failing our people,” said Angus. “We will not sit idly by while our economy slows down because of their bad decisions. The NDP will give the North its due by finally making FedNor a stand-alone regional economic development agency. That's how we will pursue job growth, long-term development, and support the growth of co-operative, Indigenous, and community enterprises.” Creating jobs in the North, protecting our environment, and setting the terms of a true nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous people are all part of the NDP’s New Deal for Northern Ontario.

The NDP Commits to Honouring AFN Promises NDP won’t repeat the mistakes of the Liberals and Conservatives. OTTAWA – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and New Democrats commit to honouring the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) priorities for the next federal election. First Nations need a government they can count on and a government that is ready to work in close partnership to finally deliver the services and infrastructures First Nations need. “Many First Nations people in Canada are facing third world conditions and in a country as rich as Canada, it is simply wrong,"" said Singh. “Justin Trudeau has said pretty words but he hasn’t delivered on justice for communities like Grassy Narrows. After four years of this Liberal government, the challenges First Nations face remain unresolved. New Democrats are ready to deliver and won’t repeat the mistakes of the past.” First Nations in Canada are facing serious issues: they cannot afford another mandate of Liberal delays. The Liberals failed to deliver on their promises and we now see that for them, Reconciliation was just a slogan in their last election campaign. Not that long ago, First Nations experienced what a Conservative government means for them and Andrew Scheer has shown that he will be no different from Stephen Harper. “The NDP's track record on standing up for First Nations people is clear,” said NDP MP and candidate Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay). “New Democrats are ready to honour our promises. We’ll work with First Nations to protect our environment, deliver services that First Nations people can count on, and make sure every First Nations child grows up in a safe and healthy home and school.” New Democrats understand that Reconciliation is about peoples’ lives and wellbeing. We will implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and will support economic development for First Nations people driven by First Nations. ",2019-09-09 00:00:00

Reality Check: Liberals will Always Side with Big Telecom Companies Justin Trudeau is hinting once again that he might consider taking actions desperately needed to bring down the cost of cell phone bills — but only after an election, and people aren't buying it. ""Trudeau wants us to believe if we give him another chance, he won’t let us down this time. Meanwhile, Trudeau’s Liberal government met with well-connected lobbyists for the telecom industry 565 times since taking office, and gave Bell, Rogers and Telus close to $50 million in subsidies and more than $700 million in contracts. Seems clear whose side Trudeau is on,” said NDP Innovation, Science and Economic Development Critic and candidate Brian Masse (Windsor West). Trudeau's record on big telecom companies includes: Two months ago, the Trudeau Liberals voted down a concrete plan that would have ended price-gouging for essential cell and internet services.
Since 2013, lobbyists and members of the four largest and richest telecommunications companies have donated $41,861 to the Liberal Party of Canada.
The Liberals met with well-connected lobbyists for the telecom industry 565 times since taking office.
A quick research shows that Bell, Rogers and Telus received close to $50 million in subsidies and more than $700 million in contracts since 2015.
While a family earning an average income of $ 43,000 a year must spend more than $1,100 a year on cellphone subscriptions, the profits of the Big Five telecom companies totalled $7.49 billion, and their profit margins have reached an astonishing 38.3 per cent in 2017.
The election commitments laid out by Jagmeet Singh and the NDP include a price cap to slash telecom bills, measures to introduce more competition and outlawing data caps. ",2019-08-27 00:00:00

Canada Must Do More to Protect LGBTQ2+ Refugees NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Critic Jenny Kwan made the following statement:
		“Being LGBTQ2+ is a crime in more than 70 countries. And in 14 countries, people still face death or life imprisonment just for being who they are. Globally, there are some 41.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and for many LGBTQ2+ individuals, they live in fear of persecution. They can be arbitrarily arrested, detained or attacked, and too often have no other choice but to flee their country to find safety. But they face significant barriers in finding a safe passageway to make an asylum claim, let alone to reach a country that will provide them with protection as even if they manage to flee to another country, their existence is often still criminalized in the first country they enter. As such, far too many still can’t find safe passage and remain in grave danger. Canada used to have an immigration stream for the internally displaced, the Source-Country Class, but that was ended by the Harper government. New Democrats are calling for Canada to establish an updated program that provides a pathway to safety for internally displaced persons and establish a special measure to help resettle LGBTQ2+ IDPs. To draw in the strength of refugee civil society organizations on the ground, New Democrats are calling on the government to work collaboratively with organizations like the Canadian Rainbow Coalition for Refugees to help resettle LGBTQ2+ people in Canada. The Rainbow Refugee Assistance Program (RRAP) has proven to be a successful and valuable pilot program. It is time for it to be made a permanent initiative with adequate long-term funding; and increase annual resettlement targets. As well, in order to ensure the success of LGBTQ2+ individuals after their arrival in Canada, we must also bolster our resettlement efforts by ensuring settlement agencies are properly funded and resourced with trauma informed and SOGI trained staff. Canadians are proud of our humanitarian and compassionate effort. Let us continue to stand firm as a beacon of hope for persecuted LGBTQ2+ individuals.” ",2019-06-21 00:00:00

NDP’s Rudy Turtle Reacts to Liberal's Failure to Reach Agreement with Grassy Narrows KENORA – NDP candidate Rudy Turtle (Kenora) condemned Trudeau's Liberals failure to reach an agreement over an on-reserve care facility for people in Grassy Narrows First Nation suffering from the effects of mercury poisoning before the dissolution of Parliament. Trudeau’s Liberals had years to come to an agreement and solve the problem, but they didn’t. “Children and elders are suffering from mercury poisoning every day in Grassy Narrows,” said Turtle. “Justin Trudeau promised to build a treatment center to help our people. He had four years to fix the problem, but he failed. This isn’t how Reconciliation works.” Grassy Narrows families have suffered from mercury poisoning because of a corporate chemical-dumping crime that poisoned the English and Wabigoon rivers in the 1960s and ‘70s. The Liberal government promised a much-needed mercury care facility to care for the sickest residents — but has been stalling, trying to get away with delivering much less than promised, or perhaps nothing at all. “Conservative and Liberal governments came and left, and the people of Grassy Narrows are still getting sick,” added Turtle. “When elected, I will work in Ottawa to ensure that Grassy Narrows is heard so we can finally build a treatment center to help people suffering from mercury poisoning and clean the river.” For New Democrats, Reconciliation is at the heart of our work. We will honour our treaties, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, close the health gap and renew the relationship between Canada and First Nations with an Action Plan on Reconciliation. Facts An independent study by Japanese researchers found that more than 90% of people in Grassy Narrows and nearby Wabaseemoong suffer from symptoms of mercury poisoning.
A 2015 scientific report found that there is ongoing contamination in lakes and rivers upstream of Grassy Narrows.
A 2018 report found that mercury exposure was linked to serious issues in children's health, including learning disabilities, language or speech disorders, anemia, and visual problems.
Only 6% of people in Grassy Narrows currently receive compensation from the mercury disability board, which relies on outdated medical criteria to assess eligibility.
Justin Trudeau promised in 2017 to solve the issue ""once and for all,"" and then called it ""very much a provincial issue"" two months later.
Earlier this year, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau sarcastically thanked protesters from Grassy Narrows for their donation at an exclusive event for well-heeled Liberal donors. ",2019-09-12 00:00:00

5 times Justin Trudeau Sided with Rich Friends and Corporations over Canadians Justin Trudeau chooses to side with his wealthy friends again and again. Here are 5 times Justin Trudeau sided with the richest people and corporations, and made Canadians pay the price: 1. Big Pharma
		Canadians are paying some of the highest prices in the world for their medication – about 25% more than the median price people in other developed countries pay for the same drugs. (Health Canada, 9 Aug 2019) Justin Trudeau’s Liberals met with big pharmaceutical and insurance companies 850 times while refusing to take real action on pharmacare. 2. Big Telecoms
		Canadians are stuck paying some of the highest cell phone and internet prices in the world. (Government of Canada, 21 Dec 2018) Trudeau’s Liberals met with telecom lobbyists 550 times. The result is an almost fifty million dollar break for Bell, Rogers and Telus while Canadians are stuck with sky high cell phone and internet bills. 3. Big Oil
		Justin Trudeau told Canadians he would take on climate change. Instead, he broke his promise to end billions in fossil fuel subsidies and bought a $4.5 billion pipeline on the public dime – all while meeting 1,500 times with oil company lobbyists. 4. Real Estate Speculators
		Housing prices are skyrocketing out of reach for Canadians. One-in-five renters are being forced to put more than half of their paycheque into housing. (Georgia Straight) Justin Trudeau has refused to take on the wealthy speculators that treat housing as a cash source, not a place to live. 5. SNC-Lavalin

And just this morning, he blocked the RCMP’s efforts to look into obstruction of justice allegations. Again and again, Justin Trudeau has shown that despite his pretty words, he always puts the wealthy and well-connected first. ",2019-09-11 00:00:00

It doesn’t have to be this way. We can make better choices.” Liberals and Conservatives have been asking families to work harder, dip into their savings or take on debt just for necessities like a place to call home, cell phone bills, medication, and dentist appointments. Meanwhile, profitable corporations and the super-wealthy have done very well over the last four years. “Like Liberals do every election, Justin Trudeau is trying to scare Canadians into settling for less – but New Democrats know that you deserve better,” added Singh. “Families are struggling, and they need help now. We’ve got a bold plan to make life more affordable, strengthen health care and confront the climate crisis. New Democrats will fight for you. We choose you.” The NDP’s New Deal for People will create 500,000 affordable child care spaces within four years, launch a universal pharmacare program, bring in no-cost dental coverage for working families who need it, expand affordable housing and give struggling families immediate help with rent, and lift the burden of student debt by cancelling all federal loan interest.

Adam Vaughan and the Liberals Paint a Pretty Picture of Their Housing Record While Experts Say “Not Much is Happening” As the Liberals gear up for an election, Justin Trudeau and his team are working hard to sell their bad housing record. In January, Liberal housing point person Adam Vaughan admitted that Trudeau’s claims on his record were inflated “to rhetorical advantage.” (Toronto Star)
And just a few weeks ago, Vaughan claimed a planned sale of the Queens Quay lands without affordable housing was out of government’s hands. The next week, the Liberals reversed course in the face of pressure from Jagmeet Singh and Councillor Joe Cressy. (Toronto Star)
In May, University of Toronto Professor David Hulchanski said that “the Liberal Party and even CMHC have mixed all these together into big sounding amounts, as if a great deal is happening. But not much is happening in terms of meeting housing need and existing spending on housing remains at a historically low percentage of the federal budget.” (Globe and Mail)
Professor Hulchanski also pointed out that “the lowest year for housing expenditures since the 1970s was 2016, when housing accounted only 0.7 per cent of the federal budget.” (Globe and Mail)
And this week, a report notes that the federal government is doing “little to help” growing challenges with homelessness. (Ottawa Citizen) But as Vaughan and Trudeau double count housing units to cover up their record, people are struggling. A recent report by Royal Lepage found the median price of condos in the GTA has risen 9% in the last year alone. (Toronto Star)
In Toronto and Vancouver, there are no neighbourhoods left where a person putting in full-time work for minimum wage can afford a modest one-bedroom apartment. (CCPA)
And the Canadian Rental Housing Index shows that one in five Canadians have to put more than half their paycheque into housing – leaving little for other necessities like food and medication. (Georgia Straight) Spadina—Fort York NDP Candidate Diana Yoon:  
		“Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan are giving us pretty words on housing, but they’ve given tax breaks to their rich friends instead of investing in the housing people need. Canadians deserve better. Jagmeet Singh’s New Deal for People would create half a million quality, affordable homes, provide relief for renters struggling to get by, and take action to end the speculation that’s pricing people out of communities across the country.” ",2019-09-09 00:00:00

The Liberals, like the Conservatives before them, are gradually destroying our supply management system and the vitality of our agriculture system. Supply management has been the lifeblood of our regions, and it contributes to our food sovereignty. We should be proud of the system we implemented, and we must protect it, not use it as a bargaining chip during trade negotiations. New Democrats are not afraid to stand up to our trade partners to protect dairy farmers and the supply management system. We did it for CETA, for diafiltered milk, for CPTPP, for CUSMA and you can continue to count on us to stand up and speak out against any further concessions to the dairy sector. As government, we commit to never opening more breaches during future free trade negotiations. After promising to fully compensate the dairy industry, the Liberals announced a package that doesn’t make a clear long-term commitment over the first year in terms of direct paid compensations to producers and does not fully cover the losses incurred by CETA and CPTPP. And this, a couple of weeks before an election. The Liberals forgot about small processors and did not take any concrete commitment for compensation due to losses from CUSMA. The NDP is committed to fully compensating producers for losses due to all trade deals including CUSMA.

When the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement was signed in 2008 and implemented in 2011, the Canadian government committed to an annual human rights assessment of Colombia. Various freedoms, including those of expression and association, were and are still being violated in Colombia, and trade union activists were frequently targeted and even murdered. But the assessment process followed by the Canadian government, and the reports that are published annually, are inadequate and have been criticized by human rights organizations. In fact, Amnesty International Canada withdrew from this evaluation process in 2017. We call on the Canadian government to stop pretending to be concerned about the human rights situation in Colombia – and instead, take concrete steps to develop a more robust evaluation system and put pressure on the Colombian government when human rights are violated.

Once again, Justin Trudeau is putting the interest of rich corporations ahead of the fight against climate change by continuing free trade negotiations with President Bolsonaro.

This is another disturbing example of Justin Trudeau saying and tweeting pretty things in public, when behind closed doors he's doing business with the person responsible for the deforestation and devastation of the lungs of the planet. Experts have been clear: economic sanctions are the best tool we have to put pressure on President Bolsonaro, especially after he refused the help offered by the G7 members.

Singh Pitches a New Deal for Healthcare in Nanaimo NANAIMO – People in Nanaimo continue to make sacrifices to be able to afford the prescriptions they need. That’s why NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says the NDP’s New Deal for Healthcare includes a pharmacare system to provide prescription drug coverage and expands Medicare to cover dental care, mental health care, eye care and hearing care. “Nothing is more important than your family’s health,” said Singh. “But the Liberals have been focused on making life easier for wealthy pharmaceutical companies, holding back expansions of medicare to cover the medicine families need. And the Conservatives have now vowed to keep Stephen Harper’s cuts to health care in place — underfunding that would make health care worse every single year. We will make different choices. New Democrats will implement a comprehensive pharmacare system so that regardless of your job situation – you just need your health card – not your credit card – at the pharmacy.” Harper’s Conservatives cut healthcare transfers to the provinces, Justin Trudeau maintained the Conservatives’ cuts, and last week Andrew Scheer promised to maintain those cuts, creating a $31 billion shortfall across Canada over 10 years. Elizabeth May’s focus has never been health care, and she says implementing pharmacare should wait for years. “People in Nanaimo are struggling to afford their medication. In the meantime, the Liberals and Conservatives are fighting over who is best to shrink your healthcare services,” added Bob Chamberlin, NDP candidate for Nanaimo – Ladysmith. “Our New Deal for Healthcare will save your family more than $500 a year, even if you already have insurance.” New Democrats will begin working with the provinces right away to target a late 2020 start date, with an annual federal investment of $10 billion. Key facts Under the Liberals, Canada’s social spending is among the lowest in the industrialized world – even lower than it was in the 1990s.
The Liberals met with big pharma and insurance companies more than 700 times and have received more than $30,000 since they’ve been elected.
Canada is the only industrialized country in the world with universal healthcare that doesn’t cover medication.
Nearly two million Canadians reported not being able to afford one or more drugs in the past year, often resulting in additional doctor visits and hospital admissions.

NDP Highlights Liberal Failures on Housing Trudeau spending less on affordable housing than Harper OTTAWA – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pledged his support for families struggling with the high cost of housing and underscored the Liberal government’s failure to provide the help people need on affordable housing. “Across this country, I hear from people struggling to keep a roof over their heads. They tell me they lie awake at night worrying that they won’t be able to make ends meet each month,”said Singh. “I meet young moms and dads, students, and seniors who have seen things get worse over the last four years as the Liberals ignored the housing crisis. I’m here to tell them, New Democrats see you and we’re on your side.” Years of Liberal and Conservative governments have forced Canadians to fend for themselves as housing costs go up and the availability of suitable places to live goes down. The Parliamentary Budget Officer recently found that the Liberals’ National Housing Strategy will spend 19% less on affordable housing as a percentage of nominal GDP than the ten years previous. “The economy is doing well, but not for everyone,” said Singh. “We need to do better to make sure that everyone has a safe and affordable place to call home. That’s why New Democrats will make affordable housing a priority, and work with communities to expand and improve existing housing, to reduce energy demand, create jobs and save people money every single month.” Jagmeet’s New Deal for People is a bold plan to address the housing crisis which the Liberals have neglected for the last four years. The NDP’s plan includes a pledge to build 500,000 new affordable homes across the country within a decade, as well as help for no-cost energy efficiency upgrades that will save money and create jobs.

The Conservatives – federally and provincially – have demonstrated over and over that they don’t want to expand public health care coverage for people. Canadians just have to look to Ontario to see the proof of Conservative cuts to health care. Under Doug Ford’s Conservatives, the provincial government: Cut drug coverage for youth under 25;

Cut out of country health coverage;

The Conservatives can’t be trusted with the health care services we all rely on. And Justin Trudeau implemented the Conservative’s cuts to planned health care spending,” added Singh. “We can make better choices.

Reality Check: Liberals Don’t Listen to ‘Different Perspectives’ Justin Trudeau is defending his Liberal government from charges of hypocrisy by claiming they listen to “different perspectives” and to Canadians with “a broad range of views” – but his government’s track record tells a different story. Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have spent years ignoring or silencing voices they didn’t want to hear. Seven experts resigned from an oversight advisory board, saying the Liberal government “betrayed” them by giving no powers to a new government watchdog that would investigate overseas human rights abuses by corporations.
The vice-chair of the Liberal government’s Canadian Firearms Advisory Committee resigned calling the Liberal government “timid” on action to prevent gun violence.
Justin Trudeau booted Ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from his Liberal caucus for their courageous decision to speak up about his office’s wrongdoing.
His former parliamentary secretary resigned from the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent after the SNC-Lavalin scandal.
A lawyer resigned from the national Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, citing “a pattern of interference from the federal government”.
When he realized the results did not benefit his party, Justin Trudeau refused to implement the all-party recommendations of the Special Committee on Electoral Reform. Mr. Trudeau likes to say that the Liberal Party is listening to Canadians. But his Party has a record of hearing only what they like – and leaving the rest. He hugs us in public with pretty words and empty promises – and then makes backroom deals with his corporate friends. But in October, Canadians have a chance to finally elect a government that has the courage to listen. Unlike Justin Trudeau, Jagmeet has been hearing what Canadians have to say.
		He’s heard from people all over the country that life is getting less and less affordable. That’s why the NDP New Deal invests in services people need, makes life more affordable and fights the climate crisis. It replaces Justin Trudeau’s empty talk with concrete action. Jagmeet and New Democrats have the courage to listen to Canadians, instead of working for big corporations and their lobbyists. Jagmeet and the NDP know whose side they’re on. ",2019-07-16 00:00:00

NDP Reacts to Devastating Bombardier Job Cuts OTTAWA - Today, New Democrats reacted to the devastating news that Bombardier will cut more than 500 jobs at their Thunder Bay, Ontario plant. They urged Trudeau’s Liberals to stop throwing the burden on the province and take action to save the Bombardier jobs and prevent future job losses. The NDP is committed to bringing together all levels of government with business and labour leaders to develop a national industrial strategy that will retain and provide good middle-class jobs to Canadian workers. “This is very sad news for Bombardier workers and their families. These jobs are not only crucial for the region and for our economy, but they are the source of livelihood for hundreds of families,” said the NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “We saw what happened in Oshawa and Windsor. And now, it is the people of Thunder Bay who will pay the ultimate price of losing their jobs. Trudeau’s Liberals have failed time and time again to fight for workers. New Democrats will always put the interest of workers first.” Bombardier decided to cut jobs after Trudeau’s Liberals bailed them out with $372.5 million in 2017. Yet again, Trudeau’s Liberals gave massive giveaways to corporations without any guarantee that jobs will be protected or remain in Canada. New Democrats know that the manufacturing sector is vital for communities across the country and are committed to fighting for a strong and robust future for Canadian manufacturing “While workers are reeling the impacts of losing their jobs, CEOs and rich shareholders will have no problem sleeping tonight,” said NDP candidate Yuk-Sem Won (Thunder Bay—Rainy River). “Trudeau’s Liberals have a choice to make, either they’re on the side of working people or rich CEOs. New Democrats will always be on the side of working people.” “This is about families and their livelihood. Trudeau and Ford need to stop blaming each other and work together to save these jobs,” said NDP candidate Anna Betty Achneepineskum (Thunder Bay—Superior North). “There is still time to be on the right side by rolling their sleeves and finding solutions. New Democrats will ensure working people are at the heart of every decision we make.” When Via Rail decided to give a $1 billion contract to Siemens – a German Company – instead of Bombardier, the Liberals refused to intervene. A made-in Canada policy in Via Rail would have ensured to keep and create jobs in Canada. The NDP’s plan to massively invest in transit could also result in new contracts for this plant.

Singh Pledges Climate Action and Good Jobs in Winnipeg WINNIPEG – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh stood with supporters in Winnipeg to highlight his bold action plan to fight climate change and partner with Indigenous peoples to build a cleaner future. “We are in a climate emergency, and people are counting on their governments to take real action to address it,” said Singh. “There is no time for denial and delay. But instead of addressing climate change, the Liberals spent billions of taxpayer dollars buying an oil pipeline that will threaten our environment and violate Indigenous rights – and the Conservatives don’t believe we’re in a climate crisis at all.” While Liberals bend the rules to let big polluters off the hook, New Democrats are committed to making sure the workers and communities most impacted by climate change get the benefits of the clean economy of the future. Singh underlined that the NDP’s bold plan would create jobs right here in Winnipeg by electrifying transit fleets, help distribute Manitoba’s clean power to other provinces, and make sure that Indigenous communities are full and equal partners in Canada’s efforts to confront the climate crisis. “Manitobans know the impacts of climate change on their day to day lives all too well. We need to take action now – and our plan will bring good jobs and prosperity to people here in Winnipeg and across the province,” added Singh. It’s all part of the NDP’s New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs to build a clean economy that works better for families. – 30 – Facts: Under the NDP’s plan, a new Canadian Climate Bank will provide support for interested provinces to inter-connect power grids to distribute clean power, like Manitoba’s hydro power, across the country.
The New Deal for People commits to ensuring that First Nations, Inuit and the Métis leadership have a seat at high-level decision-making tables to help direct climate change efforts in Canada.

Jagmeet Singh Provides Relief for B.C. Renters NDP takes action for British Columbians where Liberals have failed CAMPBELL RIVER, B.C. — Help is on the way for Canadians struggling to pay their rent every month with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh’s plan to offer rental benefits of up to $5,000 each year. “Instead of taking the housing crisis seriously, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have made phony promises. Their plan actually spends less on affordable housing than during the previous ten years under Stephen Harper’s Conservatives,” said Singh. “If we want to fix this mess, we need to have the courage to act. That’s why New Democrats will deliver immediate help for families who are struggling most to pay their rent.” The NDP’s rental benefit will be targeted at families who are paying more than 30 per cent of their pre-tax income on housing, as immediate help to make ends meet. Trudeau has told renters to wait for help, while spending 4.5 billion taxpayer dollars on a pipeline and refusing to take on the money laundering and speculation that has driven up housing prices in B.C. “We know it will take time to build the affordable housing people need; this is about getting families that are hurting the most relief right away – not waiting a decade from now, like the Liberals are proposing,” said Singh. The NDP’s New Deal for People also delivers a bold plan to fight the climate crisis, lower cell phone bills, and provide dental care and universal prescription drug coverage to make life more affordable for families in B.C. and across Canada. – 30 – Facts: According to an analysis by the PBO, the Liberals’ National Housing Strategy spends 19% less on affordable housing as a proportion of GDP than the previous 10 years, including under the Conservatives. [1]
Experts have accused the Liberals of double-counting funding and actually helping fewer low-income people than in the past. [2]
The Liberals' “Canada Housing Benefit” is too small and too late.
It won’t be fully phased-in to cover 300,000 families until 2027-28 – almost a full decade from now.
An average benefit of $2,500 won’t actually close the gap between people’s incomes and affordable rent, the PBO found. [3]
The NDP’s rental benefit will start immediately and offer a benefit of up to $5,000 per household to as many as 500,000 families who need it most.
The federal contribution to this benefit will be $1.35 billion per year, with $450 million coming from the provinces.
The rental benefit is in addition to the NDP’s plan create 500,000 quality, affordable homes in the next ten years and provide energy-efficient retrofits to save families money and reduce emissions. ",2019-09-26 00:00:00

NDP: Liberals Abandon Seniors with Meagre OAS and GIS Increases POWELL RIVER – On July 1, Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) payments increased, but according to Réseau FADOQ, the combined increases work out to only an extra $12-16 per month. NDP Seniors Affairs Critic Rachel Blaney noted that seniors are understandably unimpressed. “Does this government really think that $12-16 a month is going to make a significant difference in the lives of seniors? That doesn’t even cover a typical annual rent or property tax increase in Canada, which means that most seniors will have a harder time making ends meet than before. We know that poverty amongst seniors in Canada is on the rise, and $16 won’t fix that,” said Blaney. “Instead of pretending that the cost of a single lunch is enough to improve the lives of seniors, seniors need a government that takes real action. Universal pharmacare will save families across Canada an average of $500 per year, and seniors will undoubtedly be better off. There are far too many seniors in this country who are going hungry, cutting their pills in half, or foregoing their medication entirely because of affordability issues. We will make different choices and bring in universal drug coverage,” added Blaney. The housing crisis is heavily impacting seniors across Canada. The lack of accessible housing poses challenges to many seniors, and wait-times for long-term care facilities can stretch into years. These supply constraints have pushed prices through the roof, and seniors’ incomes simply have not kept pace. Blaney added that too many seniors in receipt of GIS will be shocked to learn that they no longer receive it this month. “It’s a problem I’ve heard time and time again. Seniors, for one of life’s many reasons, don’t get their taxes in on time. As soon as July 1 rolls around, the income they rely on to pay their rent or feed themselves doesn’t arrive.” In 2018, almost 40,000 seniors had their GIS suspended. Rachel’s Private Member’s Bill C-449 would have solved this issue, granting seniors in receipt of GIS a one-year grace-period to complete their taxes. The current Liberal government is not prepared to deal with Canada’s changing demographics and higher proportion of seniors. And the Conservatives are telling people to go at it alone. Band-aid solutions and paltry benefit increases can only work for so long. We need a holistic plan for the present and future, a National Seniors Strategy will ensure that we are taking proper care of those who made this beautiful country what it is today.

These include a former member of neo-Nazi group the Soldiers of Odin and a prominent member of Islamophobic hate group Pegida Canada. Despite these disturbing developments, Justin Trudeau is refusing to call on the Independent Debate Commission to reconsider their decision to allow Maxime Bernier to participate in upcoming leaders’ debates. This morning a reporter asked: “This morning Global News published a story showing some of the founding signatories to the People’s Party of Canada have either current or past ties to neo-nazi groups, Soldiers of Odin, far right groups. In light of this, would you ask the debate commissioner to reconsider the decision to allow Mr. Bernier in the debate?” Trudeau refused to denounce Bernier’s participation, instead blaming Stephen Harper for being selective about which debates he attended back in 2015. Jagmeet Singh has written to the debate commission to advocate against Bernier’s participation. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “It’s disappointing that Justin Trudeau has refused to denounce Maxime Bernier’s participation in the debates, even after we learned that founding members of his party are members of known hate groups.

One Year Later: Sears Retirees Getting Ripped Off While Trudeau Sides with Corporation New Democrats want a new deal for Sears Canada retirees OTTAWA – On the first year anniversary of when retirees officially had their pensions slashed by 30 percent following the bankruptcy and closure of Sears Canada, the NDP is still fighting for a new deal for these workers. When the company shut down its doors in 2018, 18,000 retirees discovered the pension plans built with their money would not pay out as planned. The NDP’s New Deal for People will ensure that pensioners are at the front of the line when a company goes bankrupt – making sure unfunded pension liabilities owed to workers, and employees’ severance pay, are the top priority. “If it wasn’t for the Liberals letting big corporations off the hook for pension theft, Sears Canada workers would not have to carry the weight of legal fees to fight for what is rightfully theirs,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Liberals and Conservatives turned their back on workers to make life easier for a big company and their executives.” The NDP's plan will stop companies from paying out bosses when people’s pensions are underfunded, and will create a mandatory, industry-financed pension insurance program. NDP Critic for Pensions, Scott Duvall (Hamilton Mountain), introduced a bill in the House of Commons that aimed to change bankruptcy and insolvency law to stop pension theft by big corporations. “Trudeau’s Liberals and Scheer’s Conservatives have done nothing to help workers whose pensions have been taken away from them because of corporate greed,” said Duvall. “Instead of strengthening support for Canadian workers and retirees, they have sided with rich corporations to undermine retirement benefits. This is wrong. New Democrats believe that every Canadian should be able to count on a dignified, secure retirement – and we’ll fight hard to protect pensions that workers have earned.” ",2019-08-08 00:00:00

The NDP is on Your Side to Make Life Better and More Affordable OTTAWA – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh marked the end of the parliamentary session on a strong note reminding people that an NDP MP is someone who stands up for everyday people. Over the last four years, the NDP fought to make life more affordable, to protect our environment, to reduce inequalities and defend workers’ rights. Meanwhile, Trudeau’s Liberals and Scheer’s Conservatives took the side of the richest corporations and helped them profit on the backs of everyday Canadians. “Trudeau’s sales pitch doesn’t match his actions. When push comes to shove, he always picks the rich and the well-connected over everyday Canadians. And people are still paying the price from the last Conservative government. The Conservatives are telling people they have to go at it alone. This is the wrong approach,” said Singh. “People deserve a government that will fight for them and put their interests over those of rich corporations. With different choices, the NDP will get better results for people.” Over the course of this parliamentary session, the NDP introduced bold solutions to make people's lives better. The NDP caucus passed motions to encourage the buying and production of local food, to create a national suicide action plan, and to encourage buying Canadian wood for our buildings. Alongside stakeholders, the NDP finally got the oil tanker ban that will safeguard our coastline, communities, and sea life from the risk of a devastating oil spill. NDP MP Romeo Saganash (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou) introduced the historic bill C-262 that aims to harmonize Canadian laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. “While the Liberals were picking and choosing which rights of Indigenous peoples they’d uphold, Romeo Saganash was pushing them to enshrine into our laws the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People,” added Singh. “It is shameful that unelected and unaccountable Conservative Senators are blocking the passage of the bill in its last legislative stages. Indigenous Peoples deserve better.” Throughout the four years, the NDP always put solutions for people front and centre in everything they did. They presented plans to give Canadians access to affordable housing, access to affordable medication with a universal and public pharmacare program, priority over the richest corporations and needed roadmaps with concrete measures to fight climate change. New Democrats are committed to continue to fight for people and are excited to bring their message to Canadians from coast to coast to coast. With an NDP MP, people have someone who is on their side, ready to put your interests first. ",2019-06-20 00:00:00

On banning scabs: In 2010, Justin Trudeau voted in favour of anti-scab legislation while in opposition.[8] In 2016, the Trudeau Liberals voted down NDP legislation that would ban the use of replacement workers.[9] According to an issue paper from Employment and Social Development Canada, an increase in the federal minimum wage “has been found to increase job stability”, would “reduce the gender wage gap” and would even benefit other workers making above the minimum wage.[10] “Justin Trudeau says what workers want to hear in public, then bends over backwards to make life easier for his corporate friends – that’s on his record,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “New Democrats know whose side we’re on.

Jagmeet Singh Fights for Good Jobs in Thunder Bay Proposes new investments in electric transit across Canada THUNDER BAY – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP candidates Yuk-Sem Won (Thunder Bay—Rainy River) and  Anna Betty Achneepineskum (Thunder Bay—Superior North) stood with hundreds of workers facing layoffs at the Thunder Bay Bombardier plant today to call for federal leadership on electric transit and Canadian procurement to keep good jobs here in Canada. “These workers and their families are paying the price for Liberal inaction,” said Singh. “The Liberals saw these layoffs coming and did nothing. It’s devastating. We need to be building more electric trains right here in Canada, not laying workers off – and making sure that the public money we spend on transit and infrastructure helps create good jobs in our communities.” These layoffs come in the wake of Via Rail selecting a German rail manufacturer for a nearly $1 billion contract, and ramped-up Buy American provisions that shut Canadian companies out of lucrative contracts. The Liberals have stood by as these contracts were lost, while doing nothing to promote procurement policies that support Canadian jobs. “These jobs are vital to our community, and the Liberals aren’t fighting for them,” said Won. “It’s time to make different choices – with Jagmeet’s New Deal for People, we can protect good jobs in Thunder Bay and create even more opportunity building the infrastructure we need to confront the climate crisis.” “Workers at Bombardier and across Canada who face similar employment losses need proactive measures and investments by the federal government,” said Achneepineskum. “The lay-off notice could have been prevented if the Liberals were committed to protecting jobs. They're clearly not. An NDP government will not think twice when it comes to standing for workers.” Electrifying all municipal transit fleets by 2030, expanding electric rail and building these vehicles in Canada are part of the NDP’s commitments in Power to Change: A new deal for climate action and good jobs. Facts Bombardier will be cutting 550 jobs at the Thunder Bay plant, half of the current workforce. Bombardier is the largest private-sector employer in Thunder Bay.

Another Study Highlights How Universal Pharmacare Will Help People Make Ends Meet NDP will immediately bring in a universal, comprehensive pharmacare program in 2020 OTTAWA – Today, NDP candidate Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway) is highlighting the release of a study done by St. Michael’s Hospital’s MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions that found that providing Ontarians with free access to essential medicines improves medicine adherence, control of blood pressure and control of diabetes. The report also found that there is a large increase – from 33 % to 86% – in people’s ability to ""make ends meet"" and afford basic necessities such as food and rent when access to medicine is provided. “Across Canada, people are having to make impossible choices every day – cutting pills in half, choosing between paying rent or filling their prescription, or going without the drugs they need altogether,” said Davies. “It doesn’t have to be this way. Trudeau’s Liberals could have chosen to stand up for Canadians and bring in drug coverage, but instead they listened to lobbyists and chose not to act. New Democrats will do the right thing and invest in Canadians' health.” Even though experts say we could have better health care, lower costs, and savings for families, pharmacare has been stalled for years. The Conservatives spent a decade making the problem worse. And Trudeau’s Liberal government let big pharmaceutical and insurance companies keep charging Canadians some of the highest drug prices in the world. “Justin Trudeau told Canadians he’d help, but behind closed doors, he listened to his insider friends. Canadians deserve better,” said Davies. “They deserve leaders with the courage to stand up to big pharmaceutical and insurance companies, and work for a solution that will make life better for everyday people. We know we can cover every Canadian through our public system, and save families more than $500 a year."" Jagmeet Singh and the NDP will fight to give every Canadian pharmacare coverage that puts an end to impossible choices – and makes life more affordable for all. ",2019-10-07 00:00:00

Bold NDP Climate Plan Boosts Locally Grown Food KINGSTON – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh brought his bold climate plan to a local farmers market to highlight the role of local food in addressing the climate crisis. “The time for delay and denial is over – we need to act. Our plan to fight climate change will create at least 300,000 new jobs, save families money, and take on big polluters. We’re going to follow the science and do what’s needed to keep warming below 1.5 degrees,” said Singh. At the Kingston Farmer’s Market, Singh talked with local farmers about how the changing climate is impacting them, as growing conditions become more unpredictable. Despite the importance of our food system in confronting the climate crisis, Liberal and Conservative governments have left farmers to struggle with a rapidly changing climate and mounting financial stress on their own – while Canadian families want more access to local food. “When we support local farmers – everyone wins. Buying locally grown products is good for the environment and the economy,” said Singh. “When it comes to the climate crisis, we’re all in this together – and more healthy local food on Canadians’ plates is part of the solution.” The NDP’s New Deal for People commits to a Canadian Food Strategy that will help connect Canadians to farmers with initiatives like local food hubs that link local producers to consumers, and community-supported agriculture, so people can enjoy healthy, local food while doing their part to tackle climate change.

Vaughan and Liberals Can’t Escape Empty Promises on Affordable Housing In June, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office found that Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan’s housing plan spends 19% less as a percentage of GDP than the Conservative plan did. Since then, Adam Vaughan has worked overtime to discredit the independent PBO’s analysis. But it’s not just the PBO that says the Liberals have failed. University of Toronto Professor David Hulchanski said that “the Liberal Party and even CMHC have mixed all these together into big sounding amounts, as if a great deal is happening. But not much is happening in terms of meeting housing need and existing spending on housing remains at a historically low percentage of the federal budget.” Hulchanksi has also described the housing strategy as “a public relations gimmick.” In August, Vaughan claimed a planned sale of the Queens Quay lands without affordable housing was out of government’s hands. The next week, the Liberals reversed course in the face of pressure from Jagmeet Singh and Councillor Joe Cressy. Meanwhile in Toronto, there are no neighbourhoods left where a person putting in full-time work for minimum wage can afford a modest one-bedroom apartment. With a record this bad, it’s no wonder that Vaughan and Trudeau got caught inflating housing numbers “to rhetorical advantage.” ",2019-10-07 00:00:00

Trudeau’s Shameful Record of Failing Indigenous Children In 2015, Justin Trudeau made big promises to make life better for Indigenous children. Instead, he fought continuously in court to avoid funding Indigenous child welfare. Since being ordered in 2016 by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to fix the discriminatory underfunding of Indigenous child services, Trudeau’s government has been hit with four non-compliance orders and 48 children in Ontario have died. But last year, he found $14 billion to give away to big corporations. This is just the latest in a long list of failures to make things right for Indigenous children: After the government received an urgent request for suicide prevention funding from Wapekeka First Nation, they said it was an “awkward time” to fund it. After several deaths by suicide in the community, the Tribunal connected it directly to the government’s refusal to comply.
They spent $110,000 to deny dental coverage for a child who needed a $6,000 procedure – only to lose in court.
Their bills to reform the child welfare system and fund Indigenous language education were blasted by experts for not including any funding to improve services. Instead of backing up his words with action, Justin Trudeau fought Indigenous children in court while handing billions in giveaways to corporations and the wealthiest Canadians. ",2019-10-04 00:00:00

Reality Check: Liberals Spent Years Profiting off Student Debt Justin Trudeau’s government profited making billions of dollars off student debt, while young people struggled to get out from under crushing debt loads. “Justin Trudeau spent four years raking in billions of dollars in interest from young people who were just starting out in life, even while they were making sacrifices to make student loans payments every month — living at home, working two jobs, even putting off starting a family,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Trudeau and the Liberals let young people down.

He gave a lot of fancy speeches about the next generation of Canadians — but never stopped reaching into their bank accounts and taking money away from them.

An internal government report called the student loan system “broken,” noting that the cost of education is growing faster than wages and higher costs of living are compounding the squeeze on young people.[2]
The average student debt burden is $26,000, takes between nine and 15 years to pay off, and payments can take up to 13% of graduates’ wages.[3]
The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that nearly half of students will have financial needs at or above student loan limits while in school by 2021.[4]
Four provinces have already eliminated their interest on their loans: British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. [5] ",2019-09-05 00:00:00

Why won’t Justin Trudeau’s Liberals tax the ultra-rich? In 2015, Justin Trudeau gave Canadians some pretty words about taxing the rich: ""I'm asking those with the most to do a little bit more to help those in Canada with less."" (CBC, 11 May 2015) And in 2017, he promised to crack down on tax dodgers: ""it is absolutely unacceptable that there be people not paying their fair share of taxes."" (CBC, 3 March 2017) Time and time again, he has talked about taxing the rich and closing tax loopholes. But his words haven’t been followed by action. You don’t have to look too hard to see why: Under Justin Trudeau, the top 1% are his senior advisors and backers. Although Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s exact net worth is unknown, he indicated in 2017 that he owned $21 million shares in Morneau Sheppell. He was forced to sell those shares after weeks of controversy for bringing in pension reforms that could have directly benefited his company and hurt workers. (National Post, 21 Nov 2017) We know from coverage of the Paradise Papers that Trudeau’s fundraising chief Stephen Bronfman was involved in “multimillion-dollar cashflows” to offshore havens in the Cayman Islands to potentially avoid Canadian taxes. (The Guardian, 5 Nov 2017) Minister of Infrastructure and Communities François-Philippe Champagne was a director of Bionest and reportedly personally approved the transfer of payments to tax shelters in the Turks and Caicos. (Journal de Montréal, 21 Apr 2016) It’s clear that despite his nice words, Justin Trudeau has refused to stand up to the rich interests who aren’t paying their share of taxes. This morning, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced a tax on multi-million dollar wealth above $20 million. Over a decade, the Super-Wealth tax will raise almost $70 billion to fund a New Deal for People. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh:

Liberals “All Talk and no Action” After Charges Deadline in Mount Polley Disaster Passes: NDP Vancouver – After a deadline of five years to bring forward Fisheries Act charges against the Mount Polley Mining Corporation or parent company Imperial Metals for the disastrous 2014 Mount Polley mine tailings spill passed on Sunday, New Democrats are calling for answers. The Liberal government must be accountable to Canadians for the biggest environmental disaster in Canadian history. “It’s incredible that we’ve gone five years, with charges under the Fisheries Act recommended months ago, with no action from the Liberal government,” said Gord Johns (Courtenay—Alberni), the NDP’s Fisheries, Oceans and Coast Guard Critic. “If this government can’t bring charges and accountability for the largest environmental disaster in this country’s history, how can anyone think they’re taking protecting our fisheries and our environment seriously?” NDP MP Fin Donnelly added that while he was disappointed by the government’s silence around the deadline, he was not surprised. “Time after time with this government, we’re seeing that their priority is protecting and siding with big business against communities. They’re letting down people who live on and enjoy Quesnel Lake, and Canadians should worry about the precedent being set here. If you’re a big company, this government is saying that there’s no accountability.” The 2014 disaster was the result of a failure of the tailings dam, which sent 24 million cubic metres of mining waste into Quesnel Lake. The Mount Polley mine closed earlier this year due to low copper prices. The community is still facing serious uncertainty about cleanup plans that are slated to continue to 2022.

Grassy Narrows is a visible reminder of the federal government’s neglect of the people of northwestern Ontario.  From Indigenous justice to jobs and housing, Liberals and Conservatives have failed to work for the region. “Grassy Narrows isn’t the only matter the federal government failed to address – so is the 25-year-long drinking water advisory in Neskantaga, the lack of services people rely on, the homelessness and the drug epidemic in Kenora,” said Turtle. “Our communities deserve better.” Neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives have worked to make things right for Grassy Narrows, a community affected by mercury poisoning since the 1960s - but they haven’t delivered either for northwestern Ontario on jobs, housing and making life more affordable for families. “I see people who struggle every day to make ends meet,” added Turtle. “The Liberals’ priority is to represent the big corporate interests they work for, instead of everyday Canadians. We have a new deal for people in northwestern Ontario that finally puts them first,” added Turtle. “Unlike the Liberals and Conservatives who work for the rich and well-connected, we’re in it for you.” The NDP is committed to make things right for Grassy Narrows and to make life better for people in northwestern Ontario.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP Health Critic Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway) are calling on the Trudeau government to join the Government of British Columbia to take civil legal action on behalf of Canadians - and investigate whether criminal charges are warranted. ""Each and every day for the last two years, 10 Canadian families lost a loved one because of the opioid crisis,"" said Singh. ""Drug companies played a role in the American opioid crisis, and they may be legally responsible for the devastation opioids caused in Canada, too. Justin Trudeau's Liberals need to stop protecting big pharma at the expense of people and communities."" Trudeau's Liberals have refused to join British Columbia's legal action to seek compensation from drug companies for the costs of addressing the opioid crisis. To date, Trudeau and the Liberals have taken no steps to investigate the role that drug companies may have played in fueling the opioid crisis. Since the last election, the Liberals have received more than $32,000 in donations from people at pharmaceutical and insurance corporations, and have met with their lobbyists at least 875 times. ""Families have been torn apart, and lives have been devastated. With the Johnson & Johnson decision, grieving parents in Canada are left to wonder if opioid manufacturers also marketed these products to Canadians and Canadian doctors in a way that skirted federal law,"" added Davies. ''It's time to launch civil action, and a federal investigation to determine whether criminal charges are warranted against opioid manufacturers and distributors for their alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis. Families who lost a loved one to this crisis deserve answers."" Jagmeet Singh and the NDP have vowed, if elected, to immediately declare a public health emergency and launch an investigation into the role drug companies may have played in fueling the opioid crisis, seeking meaningful financial compensation for the costs of this crisis. The NDP is also committed to supporting overdose prevention sites and expanding access to addictions treatment. Facts: Last summer, the NDP government of British Columbia filed a civil lawsuit against drug companies to recoup the enormous costs incurred by that province in addressing the crisis. This year, the government of Ontario announced they would join B.C.'s lawsuit.
In addition to Monday's ruling, the United States Department of Justice has already secured criminal pleas and, along with dozens of states, over $600 million in damages from opioid manufacturers for misbranding offences in that country.
From 2011 to 2016 alone, provincial drug plans across Canada spent $548.6 million on medications to treat addictions to prescription and illicit opioids. Hundreds of millions of dollars more were spent by governments for emergency room visits, first responders and treatment programs. ",2019-08-27 00:00:00

The nominations of Hugo Latulippe and Éric Ferland show a growing consensus that the NDP is the only party with a clear plan and path forward to ensure that both people and the environment win.” While Éric Ferland has built a strong reputation in the environmental field, he also has an excellent reputation in the community and cultural sectors.

The Committee has given Canada until December 2020 to provide risk assessments of the Site C Dam and adjacent oilsands development. “As Canada seeks World Heritage Site designation for additional deserving sites, including Writing On Stone Provincial Park in southern Alberta, UNESCO will understandably be querying the credibility of this government to commit the resources needed to genuinely protect a world heritage site,” added NDP Deputy Critic for Environment and Climate Change Linda Duncan (Edmonton Strathcona).

But instead of taking bold action to confront the climate crisis, Justin Trudeau spent $4.5 billion to buy a pipeline and put our environment at risk,” said Singh. “It’s time for a New Deal to actually win the fight against the climate crisis and encourage active transportation that is safe, practical and recreational.” Quality transit is essential in making our cities run and we must do better to reduce traffic in Ottawa, which has hit record levels of congestion. As an avid cyclist, Jagmeet understands the intrinsic beauty of cycling and its practical application, commuting by bike to the House of Commons when in Ottawa. “People in Ottawa want to do their part to reduce carbon emissions by not driving their cars unnecessarily, but they’re too afraid to get hit. And yet, Trudeau’s Liberals refused to invest to unlock the potential of active transportation which would make it safer for bikers, and reduce emissions and the constant congestion,” said NDP candidate Emilie Taman (Ottawa Centre). “With our plan, everyone will be able to get around by bicycle safely and conveniently.” “The people I meet want to do more to tackle climate change, but they need their governments to give them the tools to do it and their long commutes aren’t working from them,” added NDP candidate Angella MacEwen (Ottawa West – Nepean). “People deserve better. Jagmeet has an ambitious plan to build the future that we all want to give to our children.” “People had high hopes, but the Liberals have let us down. The real reason people are feeling this level of climate change impacts is because successive Liberal and Conservative governments have let the biggest polluters off the hook,” said NDP candidate Morgan Gay (Ottawa South). “People want change. With different choices, we can get better results.” Key facts: Ottawa drivers have spent an average of 107 hours stuck in congestion in 2018 and the situation is only getting worse. In 2016, it was only 31.5 hours.
Sadly, less than 5% of all commuters bike to work in Ottawa (inside greenbelt, census 2016), as compared to 62% of Copenhageners that use their bike for their daily transport. These low rates are understandable when active transportation in Ottawa can be such a hazardous undertaking.  ",2019-07-11 00:00:00

NDP Statement on Labour Day Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement: Labour Day is a time to celebrate the many advances made by the labour movement in Canada over the past decades. From the 44-hour work week to paid maternity leave, many significant battles have been fought and won. New Democrats are proud to have walked with labour all these decades. But the fight to defend workers is not over. Precarious jobs are on the rise, wages are stagnating, and everyday costs are rising. And to top it all, Liberal and Conservative governments keep giving breaks to the richest, while ordinary Canadians are forced to pay the price. Workers deserve a government that puts them first – and that’s why Jagmeet and the NDP are committed to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 right away – and growing that to a living wage.We’ll also make sure workers have more protections, and that part-time and contract workers are fairly compensated. Millions of Canadians are struggling to pay the bills every month – even when they work full time. While the cost of housing, medication, and other necessities have skyrocketed, wages haven’t kept up – and that’s because decades of Liberal and Conservative governments have sided with big corporations instead of people. Justin Trudeau promised he’d bring fairness to workplaces across Canada, but he’s sided with big business and betrayed workers, too. Today, to celebrate Labour Day, Jagmeet and the NDP are commiting to ensuring that every Canadian worker is treated fairly – and that if you work full time, you can make ends meet. Happy Labour Day!

NDP Worried about Liberals Secretive Plans to Privatize Airport Security Screening BRAMPTON – Today, the NDP is calling on Justin Trudeau’s Liberals to stop the privatization of Canadian Airport Transportation Security Authority (CATSA) behind closed doors and without worker representatives. Workers’ knowledge and years of experience absolutely need to be taken into account before government makes major modifications. “This government has chosen to ignore stakeholders and instead rely on the biased opinions of those they hire to justify privatization. This consultation process has not been open or transparent. It is shameful that workers and their representatives have not been included at all stages of this transition. The knowledge and expertise CATSA workers and their representatives have is crucial to protecting public interest and public money,” said NDP candidate Saranjit Singh (Brampton East). Not only would privatization result in higher ticket prices and erode safety standards, it would also have major impacts on workers. The Liberals show a complete lack of understanding about the effects these changes will have for workers and the traveling public. “Trudeau needs to give assurance that privatization of services will not impact the cost of travel for Canadians as well of the quality of security services,” said Stan Pickthall, General Vice-President of IAMAW. “Time and time again, we have seen Trudeau favouring the interests of big businesses and trading them for the interests of ordinary Canadians. The Liberals are working in coordination with Scheer’s Conservatives to ensure worker’s input is bypassed. Let’s make sure this will not happen again.” The NDP believes that CATSA’s funding model should be reviewed to make it stable and predictable to ensure that international standards are met. A New Democrat government commits to review the Liberals’ decision and make sure to put the interest of workers and Canadians first. – 30 – Facts: From January to July, 2019, 29.4 million passengers passed through Canada’s busiest hub, Toronto Pearson International Airport, an increase from last year.
A boom in the airlines industry will bring more passengers at every Canadian airport, which requires not just efficiency but also meeting strict safety standards that protect the traveling public.
During the budgetary process, New Democrats tried to stop the privatization of CATSA to avoid costs being passed on to the public, erosion of safety and working conditions of airport workers.

Now, Justin Trudeau thinks millionaires are already paying enough taxes. But that hasn’t stopped him from campaigning on it.

Singh: Appointing Private Banker for the 1% to the Senate Sends Clear Message Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement: ""While Canadians are finding it harder than ever to make ends meet, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals keep focusing on making life easier for the richest. Today, Justin Trudeau, once again, showed whose side he’s on by appointing a senior person in the banking sector, Tony Loffreda, to the Senate. It’s simple: his priority is working for the richest, not for the rest of us.
		In his former job, Trudeau’s new Senator focused on “high net worth” and “affluent” individuals such as corporate executives, heirs, and Canada’s richest families, to help them to pay as little tax as possible. The richest are already well represented in the Senate and after a report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer concluded that big corporations and the richest are avoiding paying more than $25 billion a year in taxes, it has become clear that Canadians need legislators that will fight to make the richest pay their fair share so we can invest in services people rely on and in programs that improve all of our lives.
		Appointing a new Senator in the dead of summer, before an election, is a sign the Prime Minister sees this as a way to help the richest and big corporations, rather than something he is proud to advertise to Canadians.
		Compared to Justin Trudeau, our New Deal for People is taking Canadians’ needs seriously by making the richest pay their fair share to make life for working people and families more affordable and to fight the climate crisis.
		We will expand health care to better cover Canadians, starting with implementing a universal public pharmacare plan. We will ensure that Canadians have access to affordable housing, child care, education, cellphone and internet services, and we will implement concrete and bold solutions to address the climate crisis that will create new jobs and make big polluters pay.""

NDP Will Help Communities Adapt to Climate Change GATINEAU – Today, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh underlined the Liberals’ failure to address the climate emergency, saying that Justin Trudeau chose to protect corporate interests above the wellbeing of Canadians. “Too many Canadians are dealing with disasters like flooding that destroy their homes and disrupt their lives. Justin Trudeau says he agrees there is a climate crisis, but he doesn’t seem to get it. He’s spent billions on a pipeline, while under-funding support for communities impacted by disasters like flooding,” says Singh. “We can do better for people. We have a bold climate plan that replaces pretty words with real action.” In 2015, the Conservative government raised the threshold for provinces to qualify for federal compensation for disasters – and the Trudeau Liberals not only kept this change but also purchased the Trans-Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion, while leaving communities scrambling for funding to fight flooding and forest fires. “The Liberals promise one thing during election, and deliver another in government. While families here in Gatineau and across the country struggle with the growing threat of floods and other climate-related disasters, Justin Trudeau was more focused on buying a pipeline than on getting them help,” added Singh. “We’re going to make different choices. We have a plan to help communities protect people from the impacts of climate change right now.” New Democrats have a real plan to confront the climate crisis and limit warming to 1.5 degrees. The NDP would expand federal funding by $2.5 billion to help communities respond to disasters and adapt infrastructure to withstand floods and other extreme weather events.

Jagmeet Singh Wants Waterfront Property Sale Stopped Singh in Toronto fighting for more affordable housing. TORONTO – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP Candidate for Spadina—Fort York, Diana Yoon, were at Toronto’s waterfront on Friday calling on Trudeau’s Liberals to halt the sale of prime federally owned land for the construction of luxury condominiums. The land, says Singh, should be used to help ease the affordable missing-middle housing crunch instead. “Too many people in Toronto are struggling every month with the cost of housing,” said Singh. “They’re stuck in a place that’s too expensive, overcrowded, or even unsafe — and can’t find or can’t afford a decent home to move their families into. Trudeau’s Liberals give lip service to the housing crisis, then turn around and sell this federal property to developers to build expensive fancy condominiums for the richest of the rich. Trudeau has a little piece of the solution in his hands — and he’s handing it over to developers.” The 1.2-acre site at 200 Queens Quay West, across from the Harbourfront Centre, is now being marketed by Canada Lands Company for private residential development. The Crown Corporation says that the site has the “potential to support a landmark two-tower development featuring a 55- and 45-storey tower above a 10-storey podium.” There will be no requirement that the development include any affordable housing. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 households are on the social housing waiting list in Toronto — more people waiting than are living in the available affordable homes. ""Torontonians are feeling squeezed by the high cost of housing - even as we work harder and harder to pay rent and survive in an increasingly unaffordable city,"" said Yoon. “Justin Trudeau and the Liberals talk a good game about housing, but as soon as the microphones are off, Trudeau does what’s best for the developers instead of doing what’s best for our community.” The NDP’s New Deal for People commits to create 500,000 units of quality, affordable housing in the next 10 years, with half of that done within five years. Working in partnership with provinces and municipalities, the New Deal will build capacity for social, community, and affordable housing providers and co-ops, prioritize affordable housing when federal lands are sold, and help meet bold environmental and energy efficiency goals.This is the body of this article.

Liberals Should be Evicted for Phony Housing Promises Justin Trudeau likes to talk about housing. But the Parliamentary Budget Officer recently revealed that Justin Trudeau’s housing plan spends less as a percentage of GDP than the ten previous years under Stephen Harper, prompting Liberal housing lead Adam Vaughn to attack the independent PBO. Earlier this year, Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan got caught when they “double counted to rhetorical advantage” on the number of housing units they built. The Liberals didn’t mention “rent” once in their 2015 platform, and haven’t done anything to help renters during their four years in government. Nearly one in five Canadians spends more than 50% of their income on rent and utilities. The PBO also found that Trudeau’s government sent an additional $100 million to Ontario for housing programs, but allowed Doug Ford to cut funding for housing programs by $161 million, scrap rent control and slash funding to fight homelessness.

New Democrats will bring in a tax on the multimillionaires alongside tougher enforcement to stop tax evasion both in Canada, and off-shore. “Families shouldn’t have to worry about their future. They deserve a government that is actually on their side. Canadians deserve prescription drugs covered by Medicare, and expanded health care services to cover people head-to-toe – and we can do this when the very richest pay their fair share,” concluded Singh. – 30 – Facts: The NDP’s super-wealth tax would apply a 1% tax on fortunes above $20 million.

It will be paired with boosted enforcement against tax evasion and penalties for millionaires who try to evade paying taxes, including regular CRA audits and third-party valuation of assets.

Justin Trudeau is walking away from families who urgently need help and telling them they need to settle for less,” said Singh. “Four years after Justin Trudeau promised high-quality affordable child care for ‘all families that need it’ – there aren’t any child care spaces for three quarters of kids under six. This is wrong.” A New Democrat government will establish a universal child care and early learning system by 2030, beginning with a $10 billion investment over four years to create more than 500,000 new licensed child care spaces in partnership with provinces, territories and Indigenous governments.

As elected Leaders in this country, we have a role to confront human rights violations, challenge persecution, and do everything we can to ensure that these atrocities never happen again.” Here is the official text of the motion tabled by NDP Human Rights Critic Cheryl Hardcastle: That the House: a) extend its condolences to all the victims of violence and war in Sri Lanka; b) call on the Government of Sri Lanka to promote justice for those affected by the Easter Sunday attacks, protect the rights of religious minorities, and defend all places of worship; c) reaffirm Canada’s call for Sri Lanka to implement its obligations within a clearly specified time frame, as mandated under the UN Human Rights Council Resolutions 30/1 and 40/1; and re-affirms Canada’s support in advancing accountability, peace, and reconciliation among all peoples on the island; and d) call upon the United Nations to establish an international, independent investigation into allegations of genocide against Tamils committed in Sri Lanka, including the last phase of the armed conflict in 2009. “It is an honour to have been part of this important moment for the community. We are building on the work of Jack Layton who has been a strong ally for the Canadian Tamil community for a number of years,” added Hardcastle. “To all Tamil Canadians, we want you to know that you have in the NDP, an ally that will always stand with you in your peaceful pursuit of truth and justice. You are a resilient and strong community that has overcome atrocities of the worst kind.” ",2019-06-19 00:00:00

Jagmeet Singh Lays Out Economic Vision to Help Young People and Families Singh delivers message on tax fairness and wealth inequality at Canadian Club TORONTO – Jagmeet Singh delivered a message on his economic vision to a lunchtime audience in Toronto today that if New Democrats are elected, people at the top will have to pay a little more. “We are not going to shy away from speaking up for everyday people – and standing up to the wealthy and well-connected,” said Singh. “The stakes are high. If we do not change the path we are on, we are putting the very idea of Canada – that everyone should get the help they need to have an equal chance to succeed - at risk.” In his speech before the 120-year-old Canadian Club, Singh made the case that despite the economy doing well over the past four years, families – and young people in particular – are struggling to pay their bills each month. Meanwhile, two Canadian men now have as much wealth as the bottom 30% of all Canadians combined. Over the last few decades, the tax burden in Canada has fallen more and more onto families - while big corporations and super-wealthy Canadians pay less. Earlier this week, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP laid out an election commitment to bring in a 1% super-wealth tax on households with a net wealth of more than $20 million. The Parliamentary Budget Office has estimated that this measure could bring in $70 billion in new revenue. “Young people are struggling to pay sky-high bills for rent, tuition, student loans, cell phones and so much more. It’s time we fixed a system that is rigged against them,” said Singh. ""We believe middle- and low-income Canadians are paying their fair share. We will not raise taxes on everyday people. But we will ask big corporations and the super-wealthy to pay a little more so we can help young people and families."" ",2019-09-13 00:00:00

Today we learned the names of 2,800 children and teens who died in residential schools. We also know there are at least 1,600 children who died that haven’t been identified. All of them had families, cultures, and names. All of them were loved. Orange Shirt Day is an important moment for everyone in Canada, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to learn and reflect on the history and legacy of residential schools, and to commit to a better future through reconciliation. Earlier this year, NDP MP Georgina Jolibois succeeded in passing a private members bill through the House of Commons to make September 30 a statutory holiday every year to mark Orange Shirt Day. Sadly, it was defeated at the hands of Conservatives in the Senate. At the federal level, we can and must do better.

Singh Lays Out Priorities For Canadians Pharmacare and dental care, affordable homes, student debt, climate, cell phone bills and super-wealth tax
		OTTAWA – With momentum on Jagmeet Singh’s side, the NDP Leader laid out urgent priorities he said the government must take on to help Canadians and vowed to fight for these priorities regardless of the outcome of the election. “People will try to scare Canadians into voting for less out of fear and settling for less. Fear has never changed a thing. But hope has,” said Singh. “I’m running to be Prime Minister. But whether I am Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition or holding the balance of power, this is what the NDP will ensure the next government delivers for people.” Highlighting reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples — from clean water to equity in services — as a foundation for all government actions, Singh shared his priorities. A national universal pharmacare plan and a national dental care plan, delivering affordability and better health to Canadians.
A home people can afford, including massive investments in housing, real action on money laundering and a tax on foreign speculators.
Beginning to tackle student debt, by taking all interest off of student loans, current and future.
A bold plan and concrete action to fight the climate crisis, ending the subsidies to big oil companies, committing to science-based targets and helping workers during the transition from fossil fuels.
Making cell phone and internet bills more affordable by putting in place a price cap to make sure that Canadians aren’t paying more than the global average for their cell phone and internet bills.
Ensuring the super-wealthy are paying their fair share by introducing a super wealth tax, closing tax loopholes, and ending giveaways for the richest companies and individuals. “We can and must change the way Canadians choose their government, so that people feel they can vote for what they believe, not against what they fear,” said Singh. “We can change the system so that every vote counts no matter where you live. And so that Liberals or Conservatives can never ignore you again. We can ensure that the next government changes the system, so it works for you by delivering real electoral reform, proportional representation, to stop the revolving door of bad and worse.” While Singh works towards an NDP victory on Oct. 21, should voters choose a minority government, he has completely ruled out propping up an Andrew Scheer Conservative government.

A comprehensive public transit strategy should include inter-city mobility. It’s clear that if I'm taking the train to another city, I will continue to travel by public transportation, but this is not always the case if I'm travelling by car. And, compared to the billions they invested in major urban centres, the Liberals are only offering a measly $71 million to the regions, for a research office, and with no guarantee that the high-frequency train project will move forward. The NDP will move forward with a comprehensive high-frequency rail project.

Study Shows How Trudeau’s Abandoned Pharmacare Promise Will Hurt People A study done by the St. Michael’s Hospital’s MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions shows that providing universal pharmacare will make life significantly more affordable for people. It found that covering the cost of prescription drugs causes a large increase – from 33% to 86% – in people’s ability to ""make ends meet"" or afford basic necessities such as food and rent, showing that for many people, medicine costs are the difference between paying the bills or not. Meanwhile, experts agree that Justin Trudeau has abandoned his pharmacare promise. Former Liberal Health Minister Jane Philpott says it falls “far short” of what is required. It’s been 22 years since the Liberals first rolled out their pharmacare promise. And this campaign, just six days after telling Canadians he would bring in pharmacare, Justin Trudeau completely abandoned Canadians struggling with the cost of prescription drugs. The lead scientists criticized the Liberals, pointing out that if they had made any progress on pharmacare in the last four years, they wouldn’t have been able to find people to participate in their study. NDP candidate Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway):
		“Across Canada, people are having to make impossible choices every day – cutting pills in half, choosing between paying rent or filling their prescription, or going without the drugs they need altogether. It doesn’t have to be this way. Trudeau’s Liberals could have chosen to stand up for Canadians and bring in drug coverage, but they listened to lobbyists and chose not to act. New Democrats will do the right thing and invest in your health by immediately bringing in a universal, comprehensive pharmacare program.” ",2019-10-07 00:00:00

Canada shouldn’t be doing business with Bolsonaro while the Amazon burns.” The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest, often called the “lungs of the planet” since it produces about 20 per cent of the world’s oxygen.

Conservatives Say One Thing and Do Another on Corporate Giveaways Andrew Scheer’s talk on corporate welfare might sound familiar to Canadians. While Stephen Harper was in opposition, he promised he would take on “corporate welfare bums.” But in government, Harper actually continued the corporate gravy train.

Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau is saying some pretty words about taxing the rich while giving $14 billion to profitable corporations.

After years of Liberal and Conservative government, Canada’s richest 87 families own the same amount as the lowest earning 12 million Canadians combined.

Experts have expressed their deep concern that Canadians may not have an adequate supply of prescription drugs due to this unprecedented step by the White House. This has the potential to impact hundreds if not thousands of prescription drugs, many of which are essential for the preservation of life. “I call on you, as the Minister of Health, to immediately reveal to Canadians what specific steps your government will take to ensure that all Canadians have confidence that the medication they need is not depleted as a result of this sudden decision from the White House,” added Davies.

NDP Statement on Federal Court Decision on “Product of Israel” Labels NDP International Trade Critic, Tracey Ramsey, issued the following statement: “This week, the Federal Court ordered the removal of “product of Israel” labels from wines made in the West Bank, in the occupied Palestinian territories. Such labels, the Court ruled, are “false, misleading and deceptive,” and therefore violate Canada’s consumer protection and food and drugs laws. New Democrats welcome this decision, which we view as a step forward for justice in Israel and Palestine. During the debate on Bill C-85, the bill that amends the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement’s implementation law, Trudeau’s Liberals chose to ignore what New Democrats clearly pointed out: the agreement covered products made in Israeli settlements and occupied territories. Liberals deliberately overlooked the fact that neither Canada nor the United Nations recognize these settlements as part of Israel. These settlements are illegal and clearly violate the fourth Geneva Convention. In light of the Federal Court’s decision, we call on Trudeau’s Liberals to amend its laws, policies and practices to ensure full compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 (2016), which calls on all States to “distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.” Products made in illegal settlements that are imported into Canada with “Product of Israel” labels fly in the face of the Government of Canada’s policy on the status of Palestinian territory as well as international law. In fact, the European Union introduced guidelines in 2015 for the labelling of products originating from territories occupied by Israel since June 1967. It’s time for Canada to respect human rights and international law. New Democrats believe that Canada must always have a strong and principled foreign policy, including when it comes to international trade agreements, that is based on human rights and international law.

Trudeau Propped Up Harper and Backed Billions in Corporate Tax Cuts Lately, Justin Trudeau has been working overtime to convince Canadians he was part of a “progressive opposition” to Stephen Harper. But Trudeau’s record at the time shows he was not so progressive and he didn’t do all that much opposing. In 2009, the Liberals had an opportunity to join with Jack Layton to defeat Stephen Harper’s budget and block billions in corporate giveaways. Trudeau and the Liberals voted for that budget instead, locking in Harper’s corporate tax cut plan from 19.5% in 2008 to 15% in 2012. That cut gave away $55 billion over five years. When Trudeau came to power in 2015, he kept those tax breaks in place. And Just last year he piled on another $14 billion in giveaways. Between 2006 and 2009, the “progressive” Liberals propped up Harper in 79 confidence motions while Jack Layton and the NDP consistently tried to defeat Harper. So while Justin Trudeau claims he “couldn’t” stop Stephen Harper in opposition, perhaps a more honest word is “wouldn’t.” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Again and again, Justin Trudeau has chosen the rich and powerful over people. He gives Canadians pretty words at election time, and then stands up for multimillionaires when he’s behind closed doors.

""Far too many people face impossible choices when it comes to their health. The current system provides incomplete coverage. It is outdated and reflects the needs of the 1950s,"" said Singh. “Quebecers deserve health care coverage that meets their needs. To make life easier for people, the NDP will implement a health care system that covers us from head to toe.” New Democrats have played a major role in shaping Canada’s public, universal health care system. Unfortunately, it no longer meets the needs of Canadians. Today's system largely reflects the politics of successive Liberal and Conservative governments. The profits of large companies and the interests of the private sector are often prioritized over the services provided to people. Too many everyday people are left to fend for themselves and cannot afford the help they need. ""It makes no sense that some parts of the body are covered and others are not.

NDP’s New Deal For B.C. Highlights Affordable Homes, Climate Action Jagmeet Singh takes on money launderers and housing speculation VANCOUVER—More affordable homes and a real plan to fight the climate crisis are at the heart of a New Deal for B.C. unveiled today by NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “When B.C. families asked for help with the out-of-control housing market, Justin Trudeau spent $4.5 billion of their money on a pipeline instead,” said Singh. “Liberals and Conservatives have failed people here for too long. British Columbians deserve a real partner in Ottawa: a New Democrat government that has the courage to do what’s right to make sure that everyone has an affordable place to call home.” While the B.C. government has done the hard work to tackle the housing crisis, Trudeau has failed to do enough on the money laundering and speculation that’s driving up real estate prices. The NDP’s urgent action plan includes a dedicated RCMP unit to fight money laundering and a national registry that prevents companies from hiding who profits from real estate, along with a tax on foreign buyers to address housing speculation. “New Democrats understand the priorities of British Columbians, and we will fight for them,” said Singh. “Working families have paid the price long enough for the pretty words and empty promises. We’ll take real action to make housing more affordable, because we’re in it for you.” The NDP’s plan to make life more affordable for B.C. families includes bringing down the cost of cell phone bills, and bringing in dental care and universal prescription drug coverage. New Democrats will also fight the climate crisis with a bold plan to defend our land, water and coasts, while creating good-paying jobs that families can rely on. – 30 – Facts: In April 2019, B.C.’s expert panel reported that money laundering funded $5.3 billion in real estate purchases and was responsible for increasing housing prices by 5% across the province. [1]
The report found that B.C. didn’t have a single federal RCMP officer dedicated to investigating money laundering.
Currently, it would take the average young person 29 years to save enough money for a down payment on a home in Vancouver. [2]
The NDP’s plan will immediately create a dedicated RCMP anti-money laundering unit – with B.C. as a priority. We will invest $20 million in additional funding each year, half of which will go to B.C., to ensure that dedicated officers work on money laundering.
Building on the leadership of the B.C. government, we would require corporations, trusts and partnerships that currently own or buy land to disclose who owns them by creating a national beneficial ownership registry. Tax authorities, police, and regulators would be able to use the information to crack down on tax evasion, fraud, and money laundering.
We will also bring in a national foreign buyer’s tax to curb speculation that’s fueling high housing prices. The 15% Foreign Buyer’s Tax will apply on the sale of homes to individuals who aren’t Canadian citizens or permanent residents, on top of existing provincial taxes. This will raise an estimated $320 million in the first full year of implementation. ",2019-09-25 00:00:00

NDP Statement on Liberal Appointments in New Brunswick NDP Ethics Critic, Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay), issued the following statement: “Yet again, Trudeau's Liberal government has shown a complete disregard for the impartiality of appointments in Canada. On Tuesday, CBC revealed that five of the last six federal judicial appointments announced in New Brunswick have ties to Dominic LeBlanc, the Minister for Intergovernmental and Northern Affairs and Internal Trade. LeBlanc's neighbour, a LeBlanc family relative, and three lawyers who helped retire debts from LeBlanc's 2008 Liberal leadership bid have all been announced as new federal judges. This level of cronyism is completely unacceptable. To make matters worse, this isn't the first time that this senior Liberal cabinet Minister has broken the rules to help his personal connections. In September, Canada's Ethics Commissioner ruled that LeBlanc broke conflict of interest rules from handing a highly profitable Arctic surf clam licence to a company linked to his wife's cousin. At this rate, it looks like Dominic LeBlanc could teach Doug Ford a lesson on patronage appointments. But it's not just about cronies. We are seeing a disturbing willingess of the Trudeau government to undermine the independence of the judiciary. This interference led to the SNC scandal and the decision by two top Liberal cabinet ministers to quit. The pattern was continued in the leakage of information on the Supreme Court nomination process and the government's policy of vetting judges through a partisan database. Time and time again, the Liberals have shown that they care more about helping their friends and donors than making life easier for everyday Canadians. Canada’s appointments should be chosen based on merit, not whether they know Dominic LeBlanc or took a big red lawn sign during the last election. It is time for this patronage to end.” ",2019-07-02 00:00:00

The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently took steps to revoke section 370 of the Indian constitution, which granted Kashmir considerable autonomy, and moved to arrest top Kashmiri political leaders, deploy thousands of troops, impose a shutdown of telephone and internet services and restrict peaceful assembly. Like Amnesty International and other civil society groups, we are troubled by such actions, which provide fertile ground for more human rights abuses in a region where the people of Kashmir regularly suffer abuses such as excessive force, arbitrary detention and the lack of due process, and communications blackouts. The Liberal government must find the courage to firmly communicate these human rights concerns to Indian authorities. We must always have a foreign policy that is based on human rights and international law, not one that pays lip service to a “rules-based international order” without actually standing up for those rules.''

Cancellation of Bell Service shows Liberal Failure: NDP Liberals are more interested in protecting corporate profits than serving Canadians WINDSOR — Today, NDP Critic for Innovation, Science, and Economic Development, Brian Masse (Windsor West), pointed to Bell Canada’s cancellation of the planned service rollout to 200,000 households as proof that the Liberals are failing to create more competition in the telecom sector to make life more affordable for people. “You can’t have a real plan to deal with telecom affordability and service without the courage to take on the well-connected telecom giants,” stated Masse.  “What’s shocking isn’t that the Liberals’ plan failed, but that it failed in just four days. Bell’s display of corporate greed to save a rounding error in their revenue is leading them to abandon 200,000 underserved Canadian households. Bell’s customers wait on hold longer than it took them to protect their price gouging.” Bell announced this week that it will reduce its broadband Internet build-out for smaller towns and rural communities, abandoning 200,000 households, in response to a CRTC decision that lowered wholesale rates for third-party Internet resellers. “For decades, Conservative and Liberal governments have abandoned Canadian consumers by allowing unfair competition to fester in the telecom market,” said Masse. “The result is that Canadians pay among the highest prices in the world for cellphone and internet service, while those living in rural and remote communities have no service at all. The Liberals’ plan will protect telecom company profits while doing nothing to guarantee Canadians wireless or high-speed internet access.” New Democrats believe that no matter where you live in Canada, you should be able to stay connected – without breaking the bank over unfair gouging. The NPD’s New Deal for People will also save Canadians an average of $10 on every cell and internet bill. ",2019-08-20 00:00:00

After Four Years of Trudeau Failures, NDP Offers New Deal For Young People Jagmeet will help young people facing unstable work have healthier, more affordable lives TORONTO – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has a plan to help young people make ends meet by giving them universal drug coverage, dental coverage, access to affordable housing, relief from student debt and a real plan to fight the climate crisis. Jagmeet’s plan will save young people $1,200 a year on cell phone fees, student debt, dentacare and pharmacare, and up to $5,000 a year on rent. “In 2015, Justin Trudeau made a lot of big promises. But four years later, the wealthiest in Canada are doing better, but things aren’t any easier for young people starting out,” said Singh. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can make different choices to get better results for young people.” Access to education should never depend on how much money your parents make or how much debt you can carry. Barriers to quality, affordable education have been set up by Liberal and Conservative governments – and it’s time to tear them down. New Democrats have a plan for young people to remove all interest from federal student loans – saving a graduate with an average loan approximately $3,400 over ten years. “Justin Trudeau walked away from his promises on pharmacare and electoral reform, but managed to find $14 billion in special tax breaks for his corporate friends. And this election, he’s telling young people to settle for less,” said Singh. “New Democrats are different. We’re in it for you, and we’re ready to make big changes to deliver a better future for young people in every part of Canada.” The NDP’s vision will also fight the climate crisis with a bold plan to defend our land, water and coasts, while creating good-paying jobs that young people can rely on.

NDP Promises Families Relief on Cell Phone and Internet Bills NDP’s plan to cap prices would save Canadian families almost $250 per year TORONTO –  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in Toronto today to announce his plan to protect Canadians from gouging by big telecom companies. Singh is calling for a cap on cell phone and internet prices, which would save families almost $250 a year. “For most Canadians, having a cell phone and high-speed Internet is not a choice — they need these things for school, for work, and to stay connected with family and friends,” said Singh. “And Canadians who are fortunate to have access to reliable service pay some of the highest prices in the developed world. They can’t afford to give these things up, even as rising costs squeeze their budgets.” Liberal and Conservative governments have left Canadians to go at it alone as telecom companies gouge them all while raking in billions of dollars. On Trudeau’s watch, the Big Five telecoms enjoyed profit margins of almost 40 per cent in 2017. To top it off, Trudeau rewarded Bell, Rogers and Telus with $50 million in subsidies and more than $700 million in contracts. “Canadians deserve better than Liberal and Conservative governments that keep making life easier for their corporate friends and harder for everyone else,” said Singh. “I’m ready to fight for everyday people and stand up to rich telecom companies. Our plan to cap prices on cell phone and internet bills is part of our commitment to make life more affordable.” The New Deal for People would also introduce a Telecom Consumers’ Bill of Rights to put an end to the aggressive and misleading sales and services practices of big cell and internet companies. The NDP will require service providers to offer basic plans that meet the needs of Canadians, end caps for internet plans and require companies to offer affordable, unlimited data plans for cellphones – so Canadians don’t have any surprise on their monthly bills. Facts: Among OECD countries and other developed economies, Canadians pay some of the highest prices for mobile wireless and broadband subscriptions.
Similar countries like Australia are sometimes paying 2 times less than Canada for the same plan.
In 2018, the total revenue per gigabyte in Canada was roughly 70 times higher than in India and 23 times higher than in Finland.
Canadian telecoms made 35 times what Indian companies made for the same data usage in 2017. As a result, Canada has lower data use than many other countries.
The NDP price cap will save families on average $10 per month for each bill meaning that a family with two plans will save almost $250 per year. ",2019-09-13 00:00:00

Singh to Trudeau: Why Are You Letting Multimillionaires Off the Hook? Yesterday, Jagmeet Singh challenged Justin Trudeau on why he won't tax the super-rich to pay for services Canadians badly need. Trudeau used to talk about making the rich pay their share. But after four years in power, Canada’s richest 87 families hold as much wealth as 12 million Canadians. Trudeau's 2019 platform includes nothing that asks the richest 1% to pay more, and offers nothing to Canadians who can't afford basic needs like rent and medication. Does Justin Trudeau think that’s fair? Singh said: “We know that Mr. Trudeau is not willing to tax the richest Canadians. We put it to him, and people have asked him, would he be willing to put in place our wealth tax on the super wealthy? He hasn’t said yes.” “No other party is willing to say we’re going to make sure that the richest Canadians, those who have fortunes of over $20 million, pay their fair share. Everyone else, Canadians, hardworking families, middle-class families, they’re paying their fair share. They don’t need to pay any more of the burden. “We’re not going to raise taxes on middle-class and working-class families. But we’re asking the richest to pay their fair share. Mr. Trudeau is not willing to do that.” Singh has made implementing a super-wealth tax on fortunes over $20 million an urgent priority in the next Parliament. The PBO estimates it will raise $5.6 billion in its first year to spend on priorities like pharmacare, housing, and dental care. Video of Singh’s comments is available here. ",2019-10-16 00:00:00

Trudeau Has Net-Zero Credibility on Climate Change Based on Justin Trudeau’s record, his phony promises on the climate crisis can’t be trusted. His 2015 platform promised “we will end the cycle of federal parties – of all stripes – setting arbitrary targets without a real federal/provincial/territorial plan in place.” But then the Liberals adopted Stephen Harper’s targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and are on path to meet them 200 years late. After the pressure of big polluters, Justin Trudeau gave them a carbon pricing exemption, delayed the Clean Fuel Standard and methane regulations until after the election. Under Justin Trudeau, Canada continues to spend around $3.3 billion a year on subsidies for big oil and gas companies, produce more greenhouse gas emissions per person than any other G20 economy and warm twice as fast as the rest of the world. The Liberal commitment to introduce legislated targets for emissions reductions could have been implemented more than a decade ago – if the Liberal-dominated Senate hadn’t let Jack Layton’s private member’s bill C-377 The Climate Change Accountability Act die on the order paper. And they blew past the 1997 Kyoto Protocol’s emissions targets by 30%.

NDP Continues the Fight for Human Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility OTTAWA – Today, Liberal and Conservative MPs have acted in concert to defeat Bill C-331, the International Promotion and Protection of Human Rights Act. The bill would have given non-citizens the ability to bring civil suits to Canadian federal courts for clear violations of Indigenous peoples’ rights, labour, environmental and basic human rights committed outside of Canada. “Canada should be at the forefront of Human Rights enforcement. Bill 331 sends a clear message that citizens who have claims that cannot be heard elsewhere can come to the Canadian courts to have their human right claims heard. It is a tragedy that Parliament declined to send that message today,” said Mark Rowlinson, labour lawyer and Assistant to Steelworkers’ Canadian National Director. Bill C-331 was defeated 238 to 49. It received unanimous support from New Democrat, Bloc Québécois and Green MPs. “Civil society’s remarkable show of support for this bill has been outstanding. I am confident that in the fall, Canadians will elect a Parliament that is going to be far more responsive to Canadians’ priorities, instead of those of wealthy corporations,” stated Julian. “Canada must promote values of respect, social justice, environmental protection and respect for the rights of Indigenous Peoples, labour, environmental and human rights here and abroad.” The bill was endorsed by over 50 national organizations, representing over five million Canadians, who wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister calling on the government of Canada to vote in favour of C-331. These groups included Common Frontiers, Canadian Voice of Women for Peace, National Union of Public and General Employees (NUPGE), the British Columbia Teachers’ Federation, Greenpeace Canada, the Climate Action Network Canada and the Canadian Association of Labour Lawyers. Prominent Canadians supporting the bill include Stephen Lewis, Maude Barlow and Ken Neuman, National Director of United Steelworkers (USW) – Canada.

We will not stand idle while hundreds of thousands of people around the world suffer gross human rights violations, nor will we hesitate to condemn violations of human rights, regardless of where they take place...Human rights are universal and fundamental – and so is our responsibility to protect them.’ “Today, the Prime Minister abandoned those words and the hundreds of thousands of people who look to Canada to help alleviate their suffering,” stated Nick Milanovic, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Law at Carleton University, labour lawyer, an arbitrator, and a union member.

But not much is happening in terms of meeting housing need and existing spending on housing remains at a historically low percentage of the federal budget.” And earlier this year, Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan admitted they “double counted to rhetorical advantage.” Canadian Rental Housing index numbers released yesterday show that in Adam Vaughan's own riding of Spadina Fort York, a median income renter is spending 56% of their paycheck on rent for a 2 bedroom apartment, leaving little behind for necessities like groceries, health care or child care.

But as we’ve seen again this week in Thunder Bay, the Liberals and Conservatives’ approach is failing: Canadian manufacturing jobs are disappearing,” said Singh. “New Democrats know that green manufacturing and the good jobs that it creates are vital for so many communities across the country. We are committed to fighting for a strong and robust future for Canadian manufacturing.” In the Niagara region, multiple manufacturing companies working on green products closed shop due to a lack of strategy and investment by the government. The Liberal and Conservative focus on no-strings-attached corporate tax cuts is putting the interests of powerful CEOs and rich shareholders ahead of communities – and it’s led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs over the last two decades. “Niagara Centre is a great place to do business, but too often good green jobs are disappearing because Justin Trudeau has given up on manufacturing – he has even said that the Liberal government is ‘transitioning away from manufacturing-based employment’,” added Allen. “These jobs are important for our community, but are also important for our fight against climate change and in helping families save money. Niagara Centre deserves a government who will fight for manufacturing. We will make different choices for better results.” ""I became interested in working in the green manufacturing industry because I care about the environment but also want a good union job in the trades. I've had difficulty finding work because the job market in the Niagara region is tough. I also have a young daughter I need to support. It's upsetting to see so many companies I could have worked for in green manufacturing that have left the region,” said Thomas McAllister-Dorricott, a young adult in the Niagara region. “I am excited that Jagmeet is putting forward a plan that will help create green manufacturing jobs in Welland and in the rest of the country.""

JOHN’S – New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh joined NDP candidate Jack Harris in St. John’s on Tuesday to discuss their bold plan to make everyday life more affordable and services more available for people in Newfoundland and Labrador. “People in St. John’s are worried about the rising cost of living. The Trudeau Liberals have spent years focused on helping out their rich corporate friends, making it harder and harder for regular people to get ahead,” said Singh. “That’s why I’m so proud to have great candidates like Jack Harris standing up for Newfoundland and Labrador in Ottawa. Jack has a proven record of fighting for families, for the health care they need, the jobs and opportunity they deserve, and the affordability to help them get ahead.” Singh is in St. John’s sharing his New Deal for People – a bold plan to make life more affordable all while addressing issues like climate change, expanding quality health care services, and working for meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous communities. The NDP’s New Deal offers 300,000 new jobs across Canada, expands and improves Employment Insurance, and creates a national pharmacare program to cover all Canadians — the first step in the plan to cover dental care and vision care. The New Deal pays for the improvements by having those who have more than $20 million in wealth pay a little more, along with closing tax loopholes for the super-wealthy and mega-corporations. Singh was joined by Harris, NDP candidate for St. John’s East and MP from 2008 to 2015, and former leader of the provincial NDP. “I know that many people are worrying about making ends meet in St. John’s East and want strong representation in Ottawa. With the NDP, we have a plan that stands up for everyday people – investing in health care and child care – and making sure everyone can afford to build a good life,” said Harris. “That’s why I’m more motivated than ever to bring this fight to Ottawa.” ",2019-09-03 00:00:00

NDP Raises Deep Concerns About Links Between Canadian Company and the Sudan Military Regime RIMOUSKI - Following a recent media report, the NDP’s Foreign Affairs Critic Guy Caron expressed deep concerns with the reported links between a Canadian company, Dickens & Madson, and the Transitional Military Council (TMC) regime in Sudan. The Globe and Mail report raises serious concerns that a Montreal-based company may be in violation of Canadian law, UN sanctions, and other lobbying and corporate responsibility regulations. “These allegations are really serious and deeply concerning. It is the responsibility of Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government to investigate this report as quickly as possible,” said Caron. “It is completely unacceptable that a Canadian company could be complicit of human rights violations and death.” The Globe and Mail story reports that the contract from the Montreal-based company was signed by General Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who is the deputy leader of the TMC and head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, formerly known as the Janjaweed. The RSF recently led the brutal crackdown on peaceful civilian protesters in Khartoum, resulting in the death of over 100 people. This also comes on the eve of Sunday’s planned demonstrations across Sudan calling on the military to hand over power to a civilian leadership, which the Sudanese military has pledged to suppress. “Unfortunately, from Saudi Arabia to Libya, and now in Sudan, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have repeatedly refused to provide proper oversight of Canadian companies abroad and have allowed the interests of Canadian corporations to take priority over human rights and democracy,” added Caron. “It’s time for Canada to match its actions to its rhetoric and ensure Canadian corporations are in full compliance with international law and human rights.” ",2019-06-29 00:00:00

Government Must Respect All Party Committee Recommendation to Avoid Billion Dollar Boondoggle OTTAWA –This week, a Parliamentary Committee called on the government to release critical information about its controversial plan to overhaul the central heating and cooling infrastructure that services some 80 buildings in the National Capital Region. The unanimous recommendation calls on Public Services and Procurement Canada to make public its analysis of the estimated Greenhouse Gas emissions reduction associated with the program so as to “enable its findings to be scrutinized”. “The government says this project will cut emissions and save money, but they’re not willing to show any numbers to prove it,” said Daniel Blaikie, the NDP Vice-Chair of the committee and Critic for Public Services and Procurement. “After financial disasters like the Phoenix pay system, Canadians deserve to know the numbers before the project becomes another boondoggle.” Testimony at committee by the public sector workers who currently run and maintain the system suggests the benefits of this multi-billion dollar investment will be far less than Canadians are being led to believe. “There is overwhelming evidence that when governments hand over these kinds of projects to private interests, they end up being costlier and accountability goes out the window,” said the National President of PSAC Chris Aylward. “The government’s unwillingness to be forthcoming with the details doesn’t give any confidence that this project will be different and public safety could be at risk.” ",2019-06-20 00:00:00

""After a year of soaring temperatures, rising floods and raging wildfires, Canadians are already feeling the impacts of climate change. But that's the problem with Trudeau's Liberals. While they're great with symbolic gestures like voting for a climate change emergency, they do the opposite of helping the environment the very next day with the approval of this pipeline expansion,"" said Singh. ""That's not going to help Canadians in the face of climate change. Instead of spending more than $10 billion on the expansion of a pipeline, an NDP government will spend that money on green opportunities to build a secure future for generations to come."" The Liberal government's approval of the project ignores criticisms of the project's violation of Indigenous rights and concerns raised over the substantial risks posed to the environment, marine life and coastal communities by increased tanker traffic and possible oil spills. ""Canadians are reeling after voting for a Liberal government that says one thing and does another. Whether it's approving this pipeline, or implementing a carbon tax that doesn't make the biggest polluters pay, this government has completely failed to keep its promise to take action on climate change,"" said Julian (New Westminster--Burnaby). ""We need to throw everything we have at the fight against the climate crisis, and that means setting ambitious targets with measures to hold the government accountable."" ""Justin Trudeau's Liberal government is not going to meet Stephen Harper's weak Paris emissions reduction targets; in fact, experts tell us they're not going to meet them for 200 years. With today's approval of the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, the Liberals are going to be even farther from reaching those targets,"" added Boulerice (Rosemont--La Petite-Patrie). ""How dare this government even call itself green, when in fact it is betraying future generations with their false environmental policies?"" ""Coastal communities are clear in their opposition to this project. It will increase tanker traffic nearly seven-fold and notably increase the risks of oil-spills to our coast and to families living on the coast. Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government are ignoring concerns and opposition from Indigenous and coastal communities,"" added Blaney (North Island--Powell River).

Trudeau’s Empty 2015 Promise on Gun Crime In 2015, Justin Trudeau promised $100 million to provinces and territories every year to fight gun and gang violence. But he delayed action until 2018, and only provided $327 million over five years – $35 million per year short of his election commitment. Of those funds, only $30 million was spent in the first year.

On this day, thirty-four years ago, a heinous act of terrorism took the lives of the 329 people aboard Air India Flight 182 when it exploded over the Atlantic Ocean. On behalf of all New Democrats, I extend my deepest condolences to the families who lost loved-ones on that fateful day. As we mourn and honour the memory of the victims and stand with their families, we recommit to working to ensure that acts of terror like this never happen again. Terrorism must never be used to advance the cause of any one group. It only leads to more suffering and more division. That’s why we must continue to fight terrorism and the conditions that fuel it, and why we must always advocate for understanding, peace, and the protection of human rights. On this day, the NDP stands in solidarity with all those who have felt the anguish of losing a loved-one to an act of terror, here at home and around the world.

How Justin Trudeau Helped Doug Ford Cut Services At election time, Justin Trudeau likes to talk about fighting Conservatives. But a closer look at his record shows that he actually let Doug Ford cut affordable housing in Ontario. A recent Parliamentary Budget Office report showed that Trudeau left a giant loophole in his National Housing Strategy. The PBO found that because Trudeau didn’t require provincial matching funds to be additional to the province’s current housing spending levels, Doug Ford was actually able to cut housing funding by $161 million this year, despite receiving federal housing money. The PBO wrote:
		“Provinces and territories that already spend more than the federal government on housing could reduce funding for housing programs while still meeting the cost-matching requirements... Ontario’s 2019-20 Main Estimates reduced operating spending on housing programs from $944 million in 2018-19 to $866 million in 2019-20, and capital spending from $302 million to $219 million, despite $0.1 billion in additional funding provided to Ontario by CMHC in 2019-20.” (PBO, June Report) This policy allows the Liberals to talk about increasing affordable housing investments without any guarantee that affordable housing spending will actually go up. So where did Trudeau’s money go? While Ford cut services, he also cancelled a surtax on the rich, saving the highest-earning Ontarians $275 million a year. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau likes to talk about how bad Conservatives are, but he’s chosen to let Doug Ford cut services for people and give tax breaks to the rich. People can’t afford four more years of Justin Trudeau’s empty promises. I’ll fight hard to stop Conservative cuts all the time, not just during an election campaign.” ",2019-10-03 00:00:00

Trudeau Refuses to Take on Conservative Premiers on Child Care This morning at the Toronto Star editorial board, Justin Trudeau dodged repeated questions from journalists on his refusal to commit to a national affordable child care program. When asked why the Liberal government wasn’t taking action on child care, Trudeau passed the buck to provincial governments: “We can’t take on things that fundamentally it’s been shown, can be ably led, and should be ably led by the provinces.” (Video) Journalists pressed Trudeau on the “double standard” of promising to take action on pharmacare (a provincial responsibility) while refusing to push the provinces on child care. Trudeau refused to directly answer the question. Trudeau’s decision to pass the buck to the provinces is a sharp departure from his 2015 commitment to “to deliver affordable, high-quality, flexible, and fully inclusive child care for Canadian families.” As Child Care Now pointed out, Liberals have objectively not even tried to respect their promise. (1) But as Trudeau refuses to help families with child care costs, even Liberal MP Wayne Long recently described child care costs as a “crisis situation” and a recent study by the Canadian Centre for Policy alternatives found that child care fees have risen faster than inflation in 61% of Canadian cities. (2) An NDP government would invest $1 billion in 2020 and grow that investment annually to reduce child care costs for families. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “At a time when families are struggling with rising child care costs, they need a Prime Minister who isn’t afraid to take on Doug Ford and other conservatives. Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau is showing that despite his nice words, he’s refusing to actually stand up for Canadians struggling with the cost of living. It’s time for a government that is willing to show real leadership to make life better for people. Families should not have to choose between having kids and having a career.” ",2019-09-05 00:00:00

Why Won’t Justin Trudeau Put Some Teeth into Medicare? Dental care is the second highest out of pocket health care cost for Canadians – trailing only prescription drugs. One out of three Canadians has no dental coverage and six million Canadians avoid seeing a dentist because of the cost. Emergency dental visits cost taxpayers more than $155 million a year. Yet Justin Trudeau’s Liberals acknowledge that “no federal investments are being made” in dental care. However, they did find time to meet with insurance industry lobbyists over 300 times in four years. Justin Trudeau’s pretty words won’t make dental care more affordable. Jagmeet Singh has a New Deal for People that would immediately help the 4.3 million Canadians now without coverage. Former NDP Leader and Medicare founder Tommy Douglas: ""The ultimate goal of Medicare must be to keep people well rather than just patching them up when they get sick... It means expanding and improving Medicare by providing Pharmacare and Denticare programs."" (The Future of Medicare, 1984) NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Instead of helping the millions of Canadians struggling with out of pocket dental costs, Justin Trudeau is meeting with insurance lobbyists and handing billions to big corporations.

And he addressed the social values New Democrats share with Quebecers. “Like Quebecers, when it comes to abortion, I firmly believe in the right to choose. I believe in the right to die with dignity. I believe in the separation of church and state, and I believe in LGBTQ rights, including marriage equality,” said Singh. “For four years, Justin Trudeau has chosen to make life easier for the wealthy and the well-connected.

Liberals Need to Lead on Solving Root Causes of Violence: NDP TORONTO - New Democrats are calling for real leadership and a real plan after Justin Trudeau refused to answer questions about how he would address the root causes of gun violence in Toronto. Instead of showing real leadership on serious issues Torontonians are facing, Trudeau was quick to blame Ontario Premier Doug Ford. Torontonians deserve a government that doesn't wait until a federal election campaign to talk about the issues they deal with every day - affordable housing, health care services, and safe cities.

""We must strike a new path, one that engages all communities in a united effort to tackle gun violence at its roots. We must replace simplistic solutions with comprehensive, well-informed strategies built out of partnership with those most affected."" In a press conference with the Prime Minister, Toronto Mayor John Tory drew attention to the lack of federal investment in kids, families, and neighbourhoods and explained how with the lack of federal resources, Toronto needs to do more to address violence over the long term. ""Mayor Tory is right to call attention to the lack of leadership from the federal government,"" said the NDP candidate for Davenport, Andrew Cash. ""I have been listening to people in Davenport and, yes, they worry about gun violence but they also worry about affordable housing, the cost of prescription drugs, and good quality jobs. It's not good enough for the Prime Minister to show up right before an election with no meaningful solutions after four years of inaction.

The promise had no timelines and funding fell far short of what would be needed for a real pharmacare program. Canadians know that the Liberals can’t be trusted to bring in pharmacare – they’ve been promising to introduce pharmacare since 1997. After the election, it never materializes.

Whether they'll announce more, that's what we're waiting for.” (Hannah Thibedeau, CBC News) “I think the Liberals are lacking a lot of details as to how and when they would do it and exactly how much it would cost.

There are no timelines in terms of implementation. We don't want four years of negotiations to take place, we want implementation and people need to know, in fact is pharmacare going to be implemented or not?” (Jane Philpott on CTV) “There’s a real concern around the dollar figure attached to this… they certainly fall short of what both the Hoskins report recommended and what the Parliamentary Budget Officer has recommended.” (Jane Philpott on CTV) “Today’s announcement contains no additional commitments or implementation details…. [Canadians] deserve to know how the party that set the process in motion plans to deliver on its promise.” (Canadian Doctors for Medicare) “When it came to pharmacare, they let a lot slide off the table.

Therefore I was appalled and disappointed to learn that Elizabeth May's Green Party is proposing to use this crisis as an opportunity to turn over water infrastructure contracts on reserve to SNC-Lavalin who are presently facing serious charges of international corruption. As we speak, my colleagues and I are working alongside Indigenous leaders to fight for the right of safe water in communities like Attawapiskat and Grassy Narrows. I’ve seen first hand the devastating impacts on children and elders who are sick because they’ve been treated like third-class citizens by the federal government. And yet, I have never met with a community who thought privatizing water systems to the benefit of large corporations was the answer. They want and expect what every other Canadian takes for granted - the right to properly funded water and sewage systems. Elizabeth May's proposal is not helpful. We are dealing with the systematic failure of Liberal and Conservative governments to live up to their moral, fiduciary and treaty obligations. This is not a time to experiment with privatizing water services.

Canadians have agreed: simple possession of cannabis is not a crime. The NDP’s Murray Rankin tabled a bill that would erase these records, and the Liberals rejected it, showing they aren’t actually worried about the disproportionate number of people of color whose lives are being haunted by a simple cannabis possession charge.

Trudeau said Scheer is “planning to give a tax break, larger than the average person makes in a year, for people who are using private corporations to hide, to protect their income.” Meanwhile, he’s refusing to crack down on multimillionaires using offshore tax havens to avoid Canadian taxes. In June, the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that Canada was losing up to $25 billion in revenue every year because corporations were doing business in Canada then transferring money to known tax havens to be taxed at a lower rate. $25 billion represents $675 in lost revenue for every Canadian. Two years ago, the Paradise Papers revealed that Justin Trudeau’s close friend and chief fundraiser Stephen Bronfman was linked to a $60 million offshore trust in the Cayman Islands which may have cost Canada millions in lost revenue.

Here are 5 times Justin Trudeau tried cover his tracks: 
Blocking testimony at the Justice Committee. After the NDP called for an investigation at the Justice Committee into Justin Trudeau’s alleged political interference in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, the Liberals voted against a motion to investigate. They voted instead for their own, weaker motion – but they couldn’t stop former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould’s explosive testimony. After that, they shut the investigation down.
 
The NDP’s call for a Public Inquiry. After the Liberals axed the Justice Committee, the NDP called for a vote on a public inquiry in the House of Commons. In a close vote that saw some Liberals break ranks, they voted it down.
 
Blocking the Ethics Commissioner’s investigation. While the Ethics Commissioner was investigating (at the request of the NDP), the Liberals refused to give documents and critical testimony protected by refusing to waive Cabinet confidentiality. The Commissioner noted in his final report that he felt his investigation was blocked.
 
Blocking the Ethics Commissioner’s public testimony. After the Commissioner released his stinging report, NDP MPs pushed to hear directly from him at the Ethics Committee.

In a supplemental report to the committee’s report on privacy and digital government issued yesterday focusing on the controversial Sidewalk Toronto project, Angus says this project should be halted. “We are talking about an unprecedented extension of surveillance capitalism into the public and private spaces of Canada's largest city,” said Angus. “The proponents have not done credible work of responding to the tremendous concerns raised by both international data experts and the Ontario Auditor General.” “The development of public space requires a much greater level of public input,” said NDP candidate for Davenport, Andrew Cash. “Sidewalk Toronto is also a risky experiment in turning over public urban space to a huge corporation that hasn’t shown it can be trusted to respect people’s privacy and democratic rights.” Sidewalk Labs was selected as Waterfront Toronto’s Innovation and Funding Partner for the Quayside development in October 2017, and the Alphabet subsidiary submitted a draft master plan to Waterfront earlier this week. “Torontonians and Canadians must be skeptical of this project,” said  NDP candidate for Toronto—Danforth, Min Sook Lee. “Canadians have a right to live free from being watched all the time by both the government and the private sector. Smart cities can be good, but a privatizing experiment in surveillance capitalism is not the way forward for Toronto, or for Canada.” “Google has deep pockets and a long memory. They’re not doing this as a charity project, and the business model is constant, total surveillance,” added Angus. ",2019-06-19 00:00:00

Minister O'Regan a No Show Two Weeks Into Attawapiskat Crisis: NDP ATTAWAPISKAT – Frustration is growing in Attawapiskat over the seeming indifference of Minister Seamus O'Regan to the state of emergency over the water crisis. NDP MPs Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay) and Tracey Ramsey (Essex) held a public meeting in Attawapiskat and met with hunger strikers Sylvie Metatawabin and Theresa Spence. This is a crisis that can be resolved by a coherent commitment to addressing the infrastructure problems. Angus says they were particularly moved by families whose children are being directly impacted by the chemical contamination in the water. ""We met children who get nose bleeds when they are given a bath,” said Angus. “These children deserve better. Their families are wondering why the Minister is not giving this issue the attention it deserves. ""The problem facing the community is seriously inadequate infrastructure. Even if the water plant is able to produce 100% safe water, the water is undrinkable by the time it reaches the taps in the homes. This is because the whole system requires an overhaul. Ramsey says the inadequate infrastructure is compounding the issues facing the community. ""We have over 300 families without homes,” said Ramsey. “The community can't build new homes because the water system is in such poor state. And the poor state of water is making people sick. This is unconscionable in Canada."" The Liberal government is sitting on a full report outlining the needs and cost of ensuring safe drinking water in Attawapiskat. The price tag is about the same amount of money the Trudeau government gave to Galen Weston to repair his fridges. The NDP is calling on Seamus O'Regan to show up in Attawapiskat and explain why his government is unwilling to ensure safe drinking water for the families of Attawapiskat.  ",2019-07-18 00:00:00

Trudeau Refuses to Save New Brunswick’s Only Abortion Clinic Last week, New Brunswick’s only standalone abortion clinic announced that it is closing because of the province’s ongoing refusal to cover the cost of surgical abortion services outside of hospitals - a clear violation of the Canada Health Act. New Brunswick has violated the Canada Health Act every single day Justin Trudeau has been Prime Minister. And every single day, he has ignored widespread calls to use the powers of the act to ensure abortion is funded. This morning, Justin Trudeau was challenged by reporters on his failure to stand up for abortion access in Atlantic Canada. He promised to “sit down with Premier Higgs if re-elected.” He insisted “we had very clear conversations when I was leader and Prime Minister.” He bragged that “we encouraged Premier Gallant to expand access.” But every single day Justin Trudeau was Prime Minister, he chose not to use his powers to protect abortion access. Now, people in New Brunswick are losing access. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau says he stands up for choice, but he has consistently refused to use his power to protect access to abortion. If Justin Trudeau was serious about standing for the right to choose, he would have acted on this four years ago instead of just talking about it. We’ll enforce the law right away so we can save Clinic 554 and we’ll work to protect improve abortion access across Canada.” ",2019-10-15 00:00:00

Singh Meets with Mayor Tory, Commits to Stronger Partnership to Help People of Toronto TORONTO – On Tuesday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh met with Toronto Mayor John Tory to reiterate the NDP’s commitment to being a strong partner to the people of Toronto. A New Democrat government will work with the city of Toronto to deliver funding for affordable housing, better transit, stronger infrastructure, and reliable services to its people. “Municipalities are the fabric of this country, but they’re being asked to do more and more with less and less funding. The federal government must be a better partner to the city of Toronto. Successive Liberal and Conservative governments have failed to massively invest in transit infrastructure and affordable housing and the people in Toronto are paying for it,” said Singh. “To make up for the lack of partnership, municipal governments like Toronto end up having to pick up the slack, stretching their resources to the breaking point. We will make different choices to deliver better results for Torontonians.” During the meeting with Mayor Tory, Singh shared commitments in his New Deal for People that will help the people of Toronto. Singh committed to create half a million units of quality, affordable housing among a host of measures to help people afford to live where they work. To help commuters get to work and fight climate change, the NDP will provide low-cost financing in support of the electrification of transit and other municipal fleets; will create a permanent, direct, allocation-based funding mechanism to modernize and expand public transit in communities like Toronto, and ensure that federal transit funding flows with an emphasis on scaling up low carbon transit projects like zero-emissions buses and electric trains. “New Democrats are strongly and genuinely committed to building a stronger partnership between the federal government and the city of Toronto. Instead of the old Liberal and Conservative approach of prioritizing the richest corporations, we will provide Mayor Tory and municipalities all the tools they need to better serve Canadians,” added Singh. “New Democrats will continue fighting to ensure you receive every single dollar of the funding you were promised. And will be a partner in delivering services to the people of Toronto every step of the way.”  ",2019-07-09 00:00:00

New Democrats Call for Bolstering Our Economy and Jobs Through Building Fighter Jets in Canada OTTAWA – On Thursday, NDP Defence Critic Randall Garrison called on Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government to use a made in Canada approach to replace Canada’s aging CF-18 fighter jets. New Democrats continue to support a fully open and transparent competition to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging CF-18 fighter jets, but one which encourages bidders to provide the best value for money for Canada. “Purchasing new fighter jets provides us a unique opportunity for getting jets which meet Canadian needs and at the same time help sustain a healthy aerospace industry in Canada. That’s why I am calling on the Government today to set criteria for the upcoming competition that will prioritize the defence of Canadian territory and provide maximum benefits to the Canadian aerospace industry by giving extra weight to bidders willing to build those jets in Canada,” said Garrison. “Any fighter jet must demonstrate the ability to operate throughout Canada’s unique geography, including the Arctic, especially given recent threats to Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic by other major air powers,” added Garrison. “And just as the National Shipbuilding Strategy has bolstered Canada’s domestic shipbuilding industry, the CF-18 replacement jets could be built in Canada, providing much needed jobs in the Canadian aerospace industry in cities like Montreal and Winnipeg.” Successive Conservative and Liberal governments have failed to meet the needs of Canada’s Air Force, with the CF-18s being pushed well past their normal operating life-span. It is questionable whether the Liberal purchase of used Australian fighters will have any significant impact on extending the life of our current fleet. “New Democrats welcome the upcoming competition, even though it remains hard to understand how this Liberal government could have taken four years to get it started,” said Garrison. “While this Liberal government has been dithering, other nations like Denmark have held a competition, selected a jet, and will be taking deliveries long before Canada even gets over the start line.” New Democrats strongly encourage the government to prioritize purchasing fighter jets with Arctic capability while maintaining interoperability with our allies. “Weighing the competition toward a priority on Artic capabilities, and production in Canada shouldn’t exclude any of the likely bidders, especially as two have already indicated building the jets in Canada is feasible,” pointed out Garrison. “Our women and men in uniform deserve the best equipment and supports possible to carry out the difficult and dangerous work we ask of them. This is an opportunity to meaningfully renew the Royal Canadian Air Force and to grow the high-tech manufacturing sector of our economy at the same time.” ",2019-06-27 00:00:00

NDP Stands Up For Good-Paying Jobs in Canada OSHAWA – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in Oshawa today to talk about his strategy for retaining and attracting the good-paying auto jobs that workers in communities across Ontario’s manufacturing heartland rely on. Oshawa is bracing for the loss of thousands of jobs when vehicle production ends at the local GM plant this year. “Workers should never, ever feel abandoned by their government – but the Liberals and Conservatives have left workers in Oshawa on their own to deal with these devastating job cuts,” said Singh. “New Democrats will always support the auto sector, but we’ll do it with strings attached – jobs need to stay here in Canada.” Oshawa’s story isn’t unique. Communities across southern Ontario have seen hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs disappear on the watch of Liberal and Conservative governments alike. In some cases, rich companies have been allowed to walk away from Canadian workers after pocketing billions of dollars in tax breaks. “Auto workers deserve better than Liberal and Conservative only show up once the jobs have been lost,” said Singh. “Workers deserve a government that’s on their side, with a plan to attract and keep good-paying auto jobs in the long run. I’m ready to fight to make sure that we’re building the cars of the future right here in Ontario.” Singh vowed to establish a National Automotive Strategy to help attract and retain investment in the sector. The NDP’s commitments include a $300 million Auto Innovation Fund, updating government fleets to Canadian-made zero-emissions vehicles and shifting consumer incentives to made-in-Canada vehicles only.

Miranda, for example, was forced to leave her home of fifteen years after her landlord ended her tenancy.

We can do so much better.” The Liberals have been promising Canadians a pharmacare program for over twenty years and have refused to deliver – leaving workers on their own. And Conservatives will make things even worse, with cuts to the services we all count on. People in Toronto are seeing that with Doug Ford, and Andrew Scheer will do the same thing – it’s what Conservatives do. “It’s a story that’s we’ve heard for so long – Liberals and Conservative promise help during elections, but they get into power and side with the wealthiest,” said Singh. “With different choices we can get better results. New Democrats are going to fight to get you the benefits you need – pharmacare and dental care at no cost, and cutting your cell phone bills every month.” Jagmeet’s New Deal for People includes pharmacare and dentacare programs to make life more affordable for millions of people in Canada, starting right away in 2020. – 30 – Facts: Universal pharmacare and dental care for uninsured Canadians are all part of the NDP’s New Deal for People, which has a number of other measures to help contract, part-time and gig economy workers.

The best way Canada can lower the price of drugs is well documented: buying them in bulk using the negotiating power of a 37-million-person single-payer pharmacare plan. But big pharmaceutical and insurance companies don’t want that, so after meeting with them more than 700 times since 2015, Trudeau’s Liberals are stalling pharmacare, and therefore making life easier for big pharma. And while Trudeau stalls, millions of people are skipping the medicine they need because of the cost. Far too often, they end up in the emergency department. The NDP is leading the fight to expand medicare to include prescription drug coverage for everyone, regardless of their job status, where they live, their age, their health status, or how much money they make.

The disturbing rise of anti-Black racism, anti-Indigenous racism, Islamophobia, and anti-Semitism, while always a reality within our institutions, seems to have intensified in the public sphere in recent years. The NDP vision document on Confronting Racism gives me hope that we will see a government that is finally ready to admit that we too have a “race problem” and that is committed to addressing it in its many forms – overt and direct and systemic and structural.

As a university professor who works with Black, Indigenous, immigrant and other racially diverse communities, I share the NDP’s stated commitment to ensuring that every Canadian is valued and respected, regardless of their race, culture and ethnic background and that every social institution is equipped and ready to identify, name, and address structurally-embedded forms of racism that harm the social, economic, and political well-being of racialized communities.

The system needs to be thoroughly fixed so that it works for everyone.” The report notes that the share of unemployed workers eligible for EI benefits is around 40%, but only 28% of unemployed workers who were earning $15 or less per hour were eligible for benefits in 2017. The report also points out that low-income workers contributed 1.8% of their employment income while higher-income workers contributed 1.1% of their income.

Reality Check: Conservatives Open to Bending the Rules for Corporate Friends Scheer too cozy with big corporation to speak out OTTAWA – When it comes to standing up for Canadians and the rule of law against powerful corporate interests, it’s clear that Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives would have chosen their insider friends from SNC-Lavalin too. Andrew Scheer met with SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce to discuss deferred prosecution agreements as recently as May 2018. (Toronto Star, Feb. 10 2019)
Following that meeting, Scheer would not speak out against a secret deal for SNC-Lavalin: “when asked if Scheer had a position on whether SNC-Lavalin should get such a deal, Harrison would only say that Scheer ‘is opposed to politicians interfering to get charges dropped for accused corporate criminals.’” (Toronto Star, Feb. 10 2019).
In March 2019, Scheer continued to sidestep the question of what he would do when companies break the law, saying that deferred prosecution agreements are “not the issue” he’s concerned with in regard to the SNC-Lavalin controversy. (Global News, March 23 2019)
Scheer’s reluctance to take on corporations that break the law isn’t surprising when you consider the Conservative record: in 2013 it was revealed that at least three companies had been given federal contracts despite violating government integrity policies (iPolitics, June 4 2013) – and in May 2015, the CEO of SNC-Lavalin stated that he had made efforts to seek a settlement with the previous government in order to avoid a lengthy criminal trial. (Trudeau II Report, p. 11) But the coziness between big corporations and Scheer’s Conservatives does not stop there: In April 2019, the Conservatives opposed an NDP motion opposing corporate influence over the Government of Canada (Vote No. 1299)

As Trudeau Campaigns on Abortion, Millions of Canadians Still Face Barriers Accessing It While Justin Trudeau styles himself a defender of abortion rights, his record tells a very different story. People in rural communities across Canada are often forced to travel hundreds of kilometers to access an abortion, while some provinces continue to openly obstruct access. In New Brunswick, abortion services are only covered if performed in a hospital.  Those seeking abortions from private clinics pay up to $850 out of pocket. Many communities have no abortion clinic nearby. In Nova Scotia, barriers to access can sometimes mean travelling over 500 km to a hospital that will provide the procedure. In PEI, abortions only became available in 2016, and there is still only one clinic that provides them. Earlier this year, the Leader of the PEI Liberals attended an anti-choice rally. But the Liberals have refused to impose real consequences if provinces make it hard to access abortion. New Democrats will make sure that abortion services are safe and accessible no matter where you live by enforcing the Canada Health Act, and stepping in to fund abortion services when provinces refuse to do so. The NDP will also bring in a universal pharmacare program that will cover prescription contraceptives at no cost. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “No Canadian should struggle to access the essential health care services they need.

Trudeau Violated Ethics Law to Further Corporate, Partisan Interests Ethics Commissioner reveals that the Prime Minister acted inappropriately VICTORIA – In a bombshell report responding to a complaint launched by the NDP, Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion revealed today that Prime Minister Trudeau broke the law to further the interests of SNC-Lavalin and the Liberal Party. “It is absolutely outrageous that Prime Minister Trudeau violated the trust of Canadians to further the interests of his corporate friends. This report proves that the Liberal government has put the wealthy and the well-connected above the law – and the Prime Minister himself is directly responsible,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. Commissioner Dion was clear that SNC-Lavalin “overwhelmingly stood to benefit from Ms. Wilson-Raybould's intervention”, and that he has “no doubt that the result of Mr. Trudeau's influence would have furthered SNC-Lavalin's interests”. He concluded that Trudeau’s actions were against the constitutional principles of prosecutorial independence and the rule of law. “Justin Trudeau is not who he pretends to be,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay). “Behind closed doors, we now have proof that this Prime Minister went so far as to break the law to cut backroom deals for his corporate friends and to benefit his political party. It’s absolutely unacceptable that the Prime Minister has been twice found in violation of the Conflict of Interest Act, a first. Canadians are rightly outraged.” In A New Deal for People, Singh has pledged that a New Democrat government would formally prohibit corporations facing criminal charges from lobbying elected officials.

Singh Promises Immediate Relief for Students OTTAWA – Jagmeet Singh and the New Democrats have announced a plan to cancel the interest on all existing and future student loans. “Young people, just starting out, deserve a shot to get ahead and build their best life. We need to make sure that cost is never a barrier to education, and we can give those who recently left school relief from the struggle to make ends meet,” said Singh. “It’s wrong for the government to be profiting off the backs of students and grads. That’s why I will eliminate all interest on federal student loans — both outstanding loans, and going forward.” Over the last four years, Trudeau’s Liberals have taken almost $3 billion from graduates in interest payments – profiting from skyrocketing student debt. “Young people deserve to graduate with hope for a better future, not a crushing debt load,” said Singh. “They shouldn’t have to live with their parents because of student debt. They shouldn’t be trapped working hard and not getting by. And they shouldn’t have to put off starting their own family because of student debt. But that’s what’s happening now. “Eliminating the interest on student loans is a simple first step to make it easier to build a good life, and I’m looking forward to talking about more of our plans in the weeks to come.” Singh was joined by Andrew Cash, NDP candidate for Davenport, at a roundtable with young people to discuss the challenges faced by new graduates.

 Facts: The NDP’s plan would immediately drop the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to 0%. This would apply to outstanding loans as well as new ones.
Under the NDP’s plan, a graduate with a debt of $13,500 (average federal student debt) will save $3,400 over the lifetime of the loan.
A graduate with a debt of $20,000 will save $5,000.
The NDP’s New Deal for People also commits to moving from student loans to non-repayable grants, and to a future where post-secondary education is fully part of the public education system so kids can go from kindergarten to a career, without the barrier of cost. ",2019-09-05 00:00:00

Our beautiful coast can be protected from the threat of oil spills. Folks can have an affordable place to live, pharmacare, dental care, lower cell phone bills and less student debt.

Fear has never changed a thing — but hope has.” Singh encouraged voters to vote in the advance polls to send New Democrats to Ottawa to fight for everyday people. “We know how Justin Trudeau’s government works,” said Singh. “It works for big pharma, but not for families who need to buy prescriptions. It works for the rich and powerful who just got another $14-billion tax break, but it doesn’t work for people who are looking for a home that’s affordable. And it works for big polluters, but not the next generation, whose futures are at risk. I don’t work for the very wealthy and the powerful like Justin Trudeau chooses to. I choose you.” The NDP’s New Deal for People delivers universal pharmacare, and a national dental plan, 500,000 new affordable homes and a dental benefit, a commitment to wipe interest off student debt, a cap to make cell phone bills more affordable, and a bold action plan to fight the climate crisis.

And to pay for it, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and the NDP will stop letting the super-wealthy get away with not paying their fair share of taxes. “The system is rigged. And the NDP is going to un-rig it to work better for everyday people,” said Singh. “With Justin Trudeau in charge, the economy works great for the big pharma companies who are making record profits, but it’s not working for families paying sky-high prices for prescription drugs. It works great for the rich and the powerful who got a $14 billion tax break, but not for people struggling to find an affordable place to live. And it works great for the big polluters, but not for the young people who are worried about what kind of earth they’re being left to live on. I’m going to fix that. My plan is all about changing who Ottawa works for, and I choose you.” On Thursday, Singh revealed the NDP’s six priorities the NDP will ensure the next government delivers. A national universal pharmacare plan and a national dental care plan, delivering affordability and better health to Canadians.
A home people can afford, including massive investments in housing, real action on money laundering and a tax on foreign speculators.
Beginning to tackle student debt, by taking all interest off of student loans, current and future.
Lower cell phone and internet bills, by capping prices.
A bold plan and concrete action to fight the climate crisis, ending the subsidies to big oil companies, committing to science-based targets and helping workers during the transition from fossil fuels.
Ensuring the super-wealthy are paying their fair share by introducing a super wealth tax, closing tax loopholes, and ending giveaways for the richest companies and individuals. Singh’s platform includes a Super-Wealth Tax on fortunes over $20 million; an end to offshore tax havens, legally used by the wealthy to avoid paying Canadian taxes; ending all fossil fuel subsidies; and ending tax loopholes. These measures raise progressive new revenues and ensure a declining debt-to-GDP over the four-year plan. Quick Facts Everything in the NDP plan is additional to existing spending and programs.

NDP Will Help More Canadians Get the Dental Care They Need It’s time to expand health care coverage from head-to-toe SUDBURY – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced the unprecedented commitment of making the first step towards free dental care for all Canadians. Including dental care in our health care system for those who don’t get the care they need will help millions of Canadians. ""No one should have to deal with the pain or lifelong damage of going without dental care,"" said Singh. ""Some people have workplace insurance plans – but millions of Canadians don't have any dental coverage at all. Trudeau's Liberals refuse to even consider helping these Canadians. This doesn't make sense. We need to ensure people are getting the care they need."" Millions of Canadians don’t visit the dentist every year because they can't afford to. Liberals and Conservatives chose to ignore these needs. New Democrats will work together with provincial partners and health professionals to expand Medicare to include dental services. ""Our Denticare plan is a down payment on Tommy Douglas' vision – comprehensive dental care as part of our healthcare system,"" added Singh. ""Unlike the Liberals and the Conservatives, New Democrats are going to help people who need it, right now."" This is all part of the NDP's New Deal for People to make life more affordable for families, young people and seniors. Facts Our plan will extend public dental care coverage to 4.3 million Canadians.
We will put in place a national dental care plan to help uninsured Canadians with household incomes below $90,000, starting right away in 2020.
Dental care will be free for housholds making under $70,000, with a sliding copayment for those who earn between $70,000 and $90,000.
Under the NDP’s Denticare plan, a family of four that has a household income of $70,000 or less would save at least $1,240 if they received the recommended dental examinations and cleanings in a single year, and if each child was treated for a single cavity.
Our Denticare plan is a first step towards Tommy Douglas’ vision – comprehensive dental care as part of our healthcare system. He championed the idea more than thirty years ago: ""The ultimate goal of Medicare must be to keep people well rather than just patching them up when they get sick... It means expanding and improving Medicare by providing pharmacare and denticare programs."" (The Future of Medicare, 1984)
Almost 20% of Canadians avoid the dentist every year because of the cost.
Ignoring dental care needs end up costing our health care system. Emergency room visits because of dental emergencies cost taxpayers at least $155 million annually but often don’t address underlying dental issues, leading to return visits and ongoing pressures on our health care system.
The Liberals have refused to even consider helping Canadians with their dental care needs. In fact, Liberal Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor recently said, with respect to dental care, that “no federal investments are being made”. ",2019-09-18 00:00:00

Why Won’t Justin Trudeau Let Jody Wilson-Raybould Tell Her Story? This morning, Canadians learned that Jody Wilson-Raybould met with RCMP investigators on Tuesday as they probe potential obstruction of justice in the SNC-Lavalin scandal. (Globe and Mail, Sept 11, 2019) As Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau gets to decide what Cabinet ministers can say in public. At first, he wouldn’t let Wilson-Raybould speak at all. Under public pressure, he eventually let her testify to the Ethics Commissioner and the Justice Committee – but his waiver only applied to selective time periods and didn’t allow her to discuss the controversial Cabinet shuffle that saw her moved from Justice to Veterans’ Affairs. And the Ethics Commissioner said his investigation hit roadblocks because Trudeau refused to waive Cabinet confidence for nine others who said they had relevant information. Now, it turns out that Wilson-Raybould wasn’t able to give her full story to the RCMP. Why won’t Justin Trudeau let Jody Wilson-Raybould and others with relevant information tell their story?

Reality Check: PM Proud of Trade Deal That Threatens Canadian Jobs Justin Trudeau is trying to sell his CETA trade deal to Canadians this week in Montreal, even though the deal will cost thousands of Canadians jobs, make life less affordable for people and will chip away at our Canadian sovereignty. The CETA trade deal is another example of the Liberals prioritizing wealthy and powerful corporations – and breaking their commitments to the rest of us. Since its entry into force, CETA has: Led to a devastating $3.5 billion trade deficit in favour of European agri-food producers, who are exporting their products to Canada at a much higher rate than Canadians are exporting to Europe, impacting our farmers and producers.
Strengthened patent protections for Big Pharma, while increasing the cost of medication for Canadians. The PBO has found expected annual costs for Canadians would rise by hundreds of millions of dollars, while another study has pegged annual cost increases could go up to $850 million for Canadians.
Chipped away – yet again, like NAFTA 2.0 and the TPP – at Canada’s supply managed sectors, resulting in significant costs for Canadian dairy farmers, who are bearing the brunt of the Liberals’ reckless trade policies without receiving adequate compensation.
Threatened Canadian sovereignty by imposing investor-states provisions that hand more powers to giant multinationals at the expense of our public interest.

This year, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Kwan each moved motions in Parliament urging the end of sex discrimination in the Indian Act, but they were shut down by the Liberal government. “Sex discrimination against First Nations women and their descendants has been enshrined in Canada's shameful colonial laws for more than one hundred years,” said Kwan. “First Nations people across the country should have the right to self-govern and be able to determine their own membership. The demands of First Nations women who have been fighting against this injustice for generations must be honoured and respected.” The final report of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry calls for ending the sex discrimination in the Indian Act. The Inquiry’s Calls to Justice were the latest demand to end discrimination against First Nations women after the “17 Tuesdays” movement and the advocacy work from groups such as the Native Women’s Association, Femmes Autochtones du Québec, and the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action. “Ending the discrimination is a necessary step towards decolonizing Canada. In 2017, the Liberals chose to keep sex discrimination in the Indian Act,” added Jolibois. “They advertise themselves as feminists and keep saying their relationship with Indigenous Peoples is the most important relationship, but they don’t follow their words.

TMX: Liberal Candidate Fought It, Trudeau Bought It Days before Justin Trudeau bought the Trans Mountain pipeline in 2018, his future candidate in Vancouver East called out the Liberals for forging ahead with the project despite “the absence of sound science.” Vancouver East Liberal Candidate and SFU Researcher Kyle Demes wrote: “Our research found large gaps in scientific understanding of the toxicity of diluted bitumen products to marine species and how the products will behave in the ocean.” “The gaps in knowledge, combined with incomplete risk assessment and insufficient baseline data, make it impossible to address the full suite of threats to ocean species and their habitats, or to assess the effectiveness of emergency actions, including spill response.” “In the absence of sound science, government has a duty to delay construction, and err on the side of coastal protection and climate progress.” (The Narwhal, May 24, 2018). Instead of listening to scientific advice from his future candidate, Trudeau bought the pipeline five days after the article was published. Trudeau also plowed over objections from his own MPs and the B.C. government. In 2014, Demes co-authored a study outlining significant scientific concerns, including the threat a spill poses to BC’s economy and human health.

		“The Trump administration’s new “Buy American” provisions will hurt Canada’s manufacturing sector and workers by restricting the access Canadian producers have to the U.S. procurement market. This is a blow for the Canadian steel industry and the whole Canadian economy. Communities across Canada have been let down by Justin Trudeau’s Liberals failing to negotiate a trade deal that protects their jobs. New Democrats know this could have been avoided if the Liberals had stood up to Trump in the NAFTA re-negotiation process. Instead of putting the interests of Canadian workers first, the Liberals withdrew their demand for access to the U.S. procurement market, and pushed forward the New NAFTA with devastating tariffs on our steel and aluminum still in place.  The latest “Buy America” procurement provisions with a 95% domestic steel and iron threshold will restrict Canadians from bidding on many new contracts, jeopardizing our jobs and our highly integrated economies, particularly in the manufacturing sector. What we have in front of us is more evidence of a Liberal government that has failed to stand up for Canadian workers and our steel sector. Once again, the Liberals failure to stand up for workers will result in losses that should have been avoided. When will they start fighting for good paying jobs instead of caving to Donald Trump?

In 2015, Trudeau promised a new relationship with Indigenous peoples, but four years later Indigenous people have been let down and even mocked by the Liberal Leader. “Mr. Trudeau said all the right things about reconciliation — but reconciliation is about action to make people’s lives better, not just pretty words,” said Singh. “The way Mr. Trudeau has treated Indigenous people hasn’t matched up with his words or promises.” On Friday, the federal government announced it is taking First Nations children to court, appealing a ruling that said the government ""willfully and recklessly'' discriminated against them — prompting Singh to say there’s no excuse that justifies the Trudeau Liberals taking First Nations children to court and demanding Trudeau drop the appeal. And in Grassy Narrows, 50 years ago, toxic chemicals were dumped into the English River system in a corporate crime that left generations of families suffering from mercury poisoning. Trudeau has failed to sign an agreement to help the community care for those suffering the effects of the poison. Meanwhile, when a Grassy Narrows community member confronted the Liberal leader at a party fundraiser, Trudeau mockingly shot back: “Thank you for your donation.” “For First Nations people who were hopeful, the trust has been broken. We’ve been let down,” said Turtle. “The people of Grassy Narrows deserve the kind of care and treatment we would all want for our families. And from coast-to-coast-to-coast, First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities have been left waiting for clean water, decent housing and safe schools where the next generation can get a good start. Indigenous children can’t wait another four years.” Singh and New Democrats have committed to building a treatment centre for Grassy Narrows residents affected by long-term mercury exposure, working with the Nation’s leadership and the community. Singh’s New Deal for People also commits to lifting all drinking water advisories for good by 2021 in First Nations communities, and implementing Shannen’s Dream, which spells out equitable access to education, backed by federal investments and infrastructure, so no students are forced into schools that aren’t safe.

I am proud of Robert Aubin’s work on this issue. He has long recognized the potential of high-speed rail and he’s worked hard to pressure Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government to recognize the need for the project,” said Singh. “Unfortunately, what the Liberals have announced today is disappointing. At the end of their mandate, this Liberal government has only done studies and what they’ve announced yet again does not guarantee the construction of high-speed rail.” The high-speed rail project has consensus among main economic and social development actors. In addition to creating good quality jobs, the project will significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. By creating paths dedicated to passenger transportation, this public transit project will allow retirees, business people, workers and students to move quickly and comfortably through the country’s most populated corridor. “People are really disappointed to learn that the announcement was not about the project’s construction, but yet another step that does not guarantee it will be acted upon,” said Aubin. “It seems easier for Minister Morneau to invest $4.5 billion in a pipeline than for Minister Garneau to invest the same $4.5 billion in infrastructure projects for communities living in the most densely-populated corridor in Canada. We can clearly see where the priorities of Justin Trudeau’s Liberals lie!” The NDP believes that fighting climate change is an opportunity to improve people’s lives. In their environment plan, entitled Power to Change: A New Deal for Climate Action, New Democrats outlined their commitment to moving forward with high-frequency rail.
