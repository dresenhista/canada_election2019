FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

TORONTO, ON
– Today, Peter Kent, the Conservative Shadow Minister for Ethics, called on
Justin Trudeau to remove Liberal MP Joe Peschisolido from caucus until the RCMP
gets to the bottom of his alleged ties to organized crime. Kent
issued the following statement:

“This morning’s media reports are extremely concerning.  It is not
appropriate for any Member of Parliament to be connected to criminals and
Justin Trudeau and the Liberals can no longer look the other way.  They
should remove Joe Peschisolido from the Liberal caucus until the RCMP gets to
the bottom of this.

“Leadership starts at the top, and Justin Trudeau has shown his caucus and
cabinet that it’s okay to bend the rules to suit your own political and
personal self-interests.

“Justin Trudeau was the first Prime Minister in our country’s history to be
found guilty of breaking Conflict of Interest rules. Since then, there have
been three other Trudeau Liberals found guilty of ethics violations. Now, we
know the RCMP is probing Peschisolido and former Trudeau Liberal MP Raj Grewal.

“Justin Trudeau promised to be different. He promised ‘sunny ways,’ but clearly
he is Not as Advertised.”

BACKGROUNDER:

Trudeau Liberal RCMP
Probes:  
Raj
     Grewal’s India Guests – The RCMP has launched an investigation into
     the actions of former Trudeau Liberal MP Raj Grewal. According to the
     Prime Minister’s Office, the RCMP has asked questions related to Grewal’s
     invitation of a former business partner onto Trudeau’s disastrous trip to
     India.
 Trudeau
Liberal Ethics Violations:  
Justin
     Trudeau’s illegal vacation to a private island
     – Justin Trudeau was the first Prime Minister in Canada’s history to have
     been found to have broken Conflict of Interest rules
     for two all-expenses paid vacations to a private island in the Bahamas.
      Bill
     Morneau’s fancy French villa – The Finance Minister was found guilty for breaking conflict of interest
     rules after failing to disclose the private corporation which
     housed his fancy French villa. This ruling came after months of ethics
     questions surrounding Bill Morneau’s holding of shares in Morneau Shepell
     which could have benefited from the Trudeau Liberal pension changes. ClaClam
     Scam – Dominic Leblanc was found to
     have broken conflict of interest rules for
     awarding a lucrative clam fishing license to a company run by his wife’s
     cousin. Since then Leblanc has been under fire for his close personal relationships to five of the six
     recently appointed New Brunswick judges.The
     Municipal Robocalls – Just this week, the Conflict
     of Interest Commissioner found Trudeau Liberal MP Anita Vandenbeld in violation of the Conflict of Interest Code
     for using her public office to try and help get her husband elected as an
     Ottawa City Councillor.  
Finally, it’s worth
noting that there continues to be two outstanding Conflict of Interest
investigations into Trudeau Liberals. Canadians are still awaiting verdicts on
the probes into Trudeau’s office’s involvement in the SNC-Lavalin scandal and into Raj Grewal’s actions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – Pierre Paul-Hus, Shadow Minister for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, issued a statement following the final vote on the Liberals’ new firearms legislation, Bill C-71:
“Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have failed to address gun crime. Instead, their legislation senselessly targeting law-abiding gun owners has passed it’s final legislative hurdle.
“Imposing a backdoor gun registry does nothing to keep Canadians safe. Not only does it fail to address gang violence or target gang criminals, but the word “gang” does not even appear in the bill.
“Conservatives believe in putting dangerous criminals behind bars where they belong, as well as respecting the rights of law-abiding firearms owners.
“A Conservative Government led by Andrew Scheer will get tough on gangs, give law enforcement the tools they need to keep Canadians safe and crack down on illegal gun smuggling. And we will repeal C-71 once and for all.”

New conservative government to extend EI parental leave to parents in mourning
A new Conservative government will ensure
that EI parental leave is extended for eight weeks following the death of a
baby, affording parents experiencing unimaginable tragedy a much-needed
opportunity to begin coping with their loss.
“With this policy, we hope to give grieving parents some
much-needed support during a time of unimaginable loss,” said Blake Richards,
Conservative Candidate for Banff-Airdrie. “The government can, and must, do
more to support Canadians undergoing such trying times.”
The loss of a child is a situation no parents should ever
have to face. Unfortunately, so many Canadians across the country are put in
this terrible situation and parents are sometimes forced to return to work with
no opportunity to begin to address the profound and recent tragedy that
confronts them.
Currently, EI parental benefits end abruptly the week
following the loss of a child, which comes as a shock to many. A parent’s
sadness should not be compounded by financial worry, and these parents should
not have to worry about their bottom line. Extending EI parental benefits is
the least a government can do.
“There is nothing that can prepare a parent for this experience. We hope that by offering more time, parents will have the important opportunity to cope, to seek help, and to be comforted by those around then,” said Richards. “My deepest sympathies go out to parents who have struggled with the loss of a child. I am proud that a new Conservative government will do more to provide support and relief to Canadians experiencing such difficult times in their lives.”
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives – “The death of a child, at any age is a painful experience – and the loss of a child is followed by the most intense grief. By extending EI benefits to grieving parents, a Conservative government will provide some relief to mourning parents.”

Conservatives unveil fully costed platform that eliminates Justin Trudeau’s deficit by 2024.
Today, Canada’s Conservatives released Andrew Scheer’s
Plan for You to Get Ahead, a fully
costed platform that details how a new Conservative government will live within
its means and put more money in your pockets.
In his remarks, Andrew Scheer
offered examples of how typical Canadian families will get ahead under a new
Conservative government:
Under a new Conservative government,
an average retired couple living in Tsawwassen will save $2,580 a year.Under a new Conservative government, a family of four – soon to be five –
in Montreal will save $4,642 a year.Under a new Conservative government,
a family of four in Markham will save $3,264 a year.
“Under
Justin Trudeau, Canadians are working harder and harder, but they’re just not
getting ahead. Everything keeps getting more expensive and if Trudeau is
re-elected, it will only get worse,” Scheer said.
“My Plan For You To Get Ahead is filled with
achievable and tangible ways that a new Conservative government under my
leadership will put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.”
The Conservative
platform also shows a costed and independently verified path back to a balanced
budget by 2024-2025. This will be done through a combination of spending
restraint and reductions to both corporate handouts to profitable corporations
and foreign aid to relatively wealthy countries.
“My
plan eliminates Justin Trudeau’s damaging deficits because Conservatives know a
balanced budget is the only way to make sure services like health care are
protected,” Scheer said. 
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will provide:
1. More money for you, for your kids, and for your retirement 
By scrapping Trudeau’s carbon tax, providing a Universal Tax Cut, taking the GST off home heating, making maternity benefits tax-free, boosting the RESP, increasing the Age Credit, bringing back tax credits for children’s arts, fitness, and learning, and introducing the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit.
2. More good jobs
By reversing Trudeau’s tax hikes on small business, creating a National Energy Corridor to generate opportunities, boosting innovation and commercialization, supporting economic immigration, promoting interprovincial trade, building infrastructure projects that reduce commute times and lower emissions, and more.
3. More innovation to fight climate change 
By taking the fight against climate change global and incentivizing industry to develop emissions-reducing technology that can be shared with the world’s highest-emitting countries.
4. More help at home
By supporting our veterans, improving our correctional system, securing our neighbourhoods, strengthening border protection, reducing health care wait times, and more.
5. More strength abroad 
By
confronting the global complexities of climate change, human migration,
cybersecurity, and national defence, renewing relationships with important
allies, and standing up for Canada on the world stage. 
“It’s
time to turn the page on four years of broken promises. As Canadians, it’s time
for Canadians to look to the future once again with confidence,” Scheer said. 
The
platform was verified by Jack Mintz, President’s Fellow at the University of
Calgary’s School of Public Policy.
“I
conclude, therefore, that the Conservative Party fiscal plan is reasonably
estimated, resulting in a budgetary balance in five years subject to
uncertainties that impact any economic forecast including those of the PBO,”
Mintz said.

an expansion of the Child Disability Tax Credit. 
But
the last time Justin Trudeau needed money for his out-of-control deficit

In
2016 Justin Trudeau ordered the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to crack down on

FOR
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – Andrew Scheer, Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and Leader of the Official Opposition, issued the following statement on Black Ribbon Day, the National Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Communism and Nazism in Europe:  “Today, communities across Canada and around the world will take part in ceremonies to mark Black Ribbon Day, a day of tribute to the millions of innocent victims of Communism and Nazism in Europe. 
“Established in
2009 by a unanimous decision of the House of Commons, Black Ribbon Day
commemorates the signing of the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Orchestrated
eighty years ago between the Soviet and National Socialist regimes, this secret
agreement divided Europe into spheres of influence and resulted in the suffering,
humiliation, and death of millions of innocent victims.
On September 1,
1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland from the West, provoking the outbreak of
World War II, and then an equally brutal invasion by the Soviet Union in the
East followed two weeks later. 
“Stalin’s secret
agreement with Hitler allowed the Nazis to perpetrate the Holocaust, while the
Soviets invaded several other independent sovereign nations and sent many
innocent men and women to forced-labour camps, also known as gulags. 
“Following the
end of the war, the Nazi regime was destroyed, but the Soviet regime survived
and spread its terror across the eastern half of Europe for decades. It was not
finally stopped until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
“Many of those fleeing Soviet communist
persecution and oppression made Canada their home. Often arriving alone
and with little means, these remarkably strong-willed and hard-working
individuals made incredible contributions to our society. 
“We
must strongly condemn any whitewashing of the atrocities committed by the Nazi
and Soviet regimes, and the spread of hate, propaganda, and disinformation.

“On behalf of the Conservative Party of Canada and Official Opposition, I
commend those organizing and participating in Black Ribbon Day observances
today. I join with you in remembering the victims of Soviet and Nazi terror in
Europe. It is our duty to educate future generations about the atrocities of
the past in order to ensure that these murderous ideologies never have a chance
to rise again.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 REGINA, SK – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, released the following statement regarding the Trudeau government’s shipbuilding announcement today:
 “There are less than 100 days to the next election, and the Trudeau government is once again campaigning on the taxpayers’ dime, trying to buy people’s votes with their own money.
 “While it is good to see shipbuilding work go to Davie, today’s announcement is nothing but cynical electioneering from a government that will do anything and say anything to cling to power.
 “Canada’s Conservatives have championed the hard-working women and men at the Davie shipyard since day one, because they have delivered much needed ships on time and on budget. Our track-record of support is in direct contrast to the Trudeau government’s record of failure and disappointment. One of the very first things the Trudeau government tried to do after the 2015 election was to try and cancel the Asterix contract with Davie, and when it didn’t go their way they smeared the reputation of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman – a 38 year veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces.
 “When it comes to the shipbuilding industry, the Trudeau government has only ever encouraged delays and mismanagement. They have costed Canadian taxpayers billions of dollars.
 “Canada’s Conservatives will always stand up for our shipbuilding industry and for the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces. This is why, in November of 2017, we called on Justin Trudeau and the Liberals to order a second interim supply ship from Davie. The Trudeau Government has once again failed to do the right thing.
 “While the Trudeau Liberals will try to swoop in at the final-hour, right before an election to buy people’s votes, Canadians should not be fooled. Justin Trudeau is clearly Not as Advertised.”

Justin Trudeau signed letter endorsing a Liberal-NDP coalition in 2008, just months after first being elected as a Member of Parliament
Justin Trudeau will pay any price to hold
onto power. He was willing to do it in 2008 and he is willing to do it now.
As a newly elected Member of Parliament in 2008, one of
Justin Trudeau’s first orders of business was to sign a letter to the Governor
General announcing his support and participation in a Liberal-Bloc-NDP
coalition. https://cpcassets.conservative.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15120538/0d1734dbea4f1b5.pdf
In fact, according to Brian Topp, one of the chief
negotiators of the coalition was Trudeau’s most trusted advisor, Katie Telford.
The 2008 coalition, like the coalition Trudeau refuses to
rule out with Jagmeet Singh, would have led to economic disaster in Canada with
skyrocketing taxes and mass unemployment. 
Canadians cannot trust Justin Trudeau. If he won’t rule
out a coalition with the NDP, it’s because he has a secret plan to do it when
he is defeated. If Trudeau has no plan to join a coalition, why won’t he simply
say it? 
Trudeau is already promising higher taxes and bigger
deficits if he’s re-elected. Imagine how much more you will pay with Trudeau
held hostage by the NDP.
The NDP’s price for propping up Trudeau will be even
higher taxes, more reckless spending, fewer jobs, bigger deficits, and more
debt.
The choice is clear. A Liberal-NDP coalition that will
cost you thousands of dollars more, or a Conservative government that will live
within its means and put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.

conservative,https://www.conservative.ca/five-unanswered-questions-regarding-justin-trudeaus-plastics-ban/,"
Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives recognize that plastic pollution is a real problem that needs to be addressed.
Justin Trudeau has had three and a half years to come up with a real plan for the environment. Instead of real action, Justin Trudeau has always been more interested in chasing headlines and jet-setting to international photo-ops with celebrity friends.
What Justin Trudeau announced today is nothing more than a cynical re-election gimmick which will do nothing to reduce plastic waste and clean up litter in our parks and waterways.
Today’s announcement leaves Canadians with more questions than answers. Here are five things we still don’t know:
1) How much will this cost Canadians?
Whether it’s the local grocer or the family restaurant, small businesses use plastics to offer affordable options to customers. Whether it’s a picnic or a backyard barbeque, families depend on affordable plastic products as they spend quality time together in the summer months.
Regardless of the details of Justin Trudeau’s announcement, it will be responsible Canadians who will pay the price of this cynical re-election scheme. The people deserve to know exactly how much this will cost families and job-creators.
https://www.thestar.com/halifax/2019/06/05/canadians-eager-to-cut-plastic-packaging-on-food-but-lose-their-appetite-once-the-price-increases-study-finds.html
2) What about China and the developing world?
Global problems require global solutions. Going after responsible Canadian consumers while ignoring the real problems that are happening around the world will do nothing to prevent plastic pollution in our oceans.
Here are some cold-hard facts that Justin Trudeau seems to be forgetting as he announces this cynical re-election scheme:
• The majority of all ocean plastics is coming from the developing world: https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-truth-about-ocean-plastic-why-straw-bans-are-not-the-earth-saving-milestone-you-might-think
• A 2017 Ocean Conservancy report concluded that 60 per cent of the world’s ocean plastic pollution could be traced to just five countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam: https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/full-report-stemming-the.pdf
• A 2017 study from Germany’s Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research concluded that up to 95 per cent of the world’s ocean plastic was coming from 10 rivers: Eight in Asia and two in Africa: https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=36336&webc_pm=34/2017
3) Why isn’t Justin Trudeau addressing the root of the problem – plastic waste recycling in Canada?
Canadians are responsible environmental stewards who want to take action close to home to build a better environment for their children and grandchildren.
Canadians want to dispose of their waste responsibly; however a report done earlier this year by Deloitte and ChemInfo Services found that in 2016 only 9 per cent of plastic waste was recycled in Canada, with 87 per cent ending up in landfills: https://www.taxpayer.com/media/En4-366-1-2019-eng.pdf
4) What is Justin Trudeau’s plan for the more than 90,000 Canadians employed in plastics manufacturing?
Between 2012 and 2017, plastics manufacturing became one of the fastest-growing sectors in the entire country. There are 93,000 people employed in the plastics industry in more than 1,900 companies based mainly in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta: https://www.taxpayer.com/media/En4-366-1-2019-eng.pdf
There are 93,000 Canadian families who depend on the plastics industry to keep their lights on and put food on their table.
5) When will Justin Trudeau stop sending Canada’s recycling to other countries to be burned?
Justin Trudeau has created global uncertainty after a number of Asian countries started rejecting Canada’s plastic waste, including China, Malaysia, India, and the Philippines: https://globalnews.ca/news/5199883/canada-recycling-programs/
Any announcement Justin Trudeau makes today, is nothing but a cynical re-election ploy if it doesn’t involve global conservations about the disposal of plastic waste in the developing world.

  *   Chief John Helin – National Coalition of Chiefs (SOURCE: http://www.cpac.ca/en/programs/headline-politics/episodes/66003913)
 
“If the bill is approved as amended by the House, it will hurt our capacity to
create the interprovincial transmission lines necessary to create modern
electrical grids in Canada, it will challenge our ability to improve our ports
to keep Canada connected to global supply chains, and it will make it harder to
develop the infrastructure and rail networks that keep Canadians an Canadian
goods moving.”
 
“The repercussions will hit manufacturers, exporters, and even down to the
technology companies that provide software and services to our major

“Adopting Bill C-69 without the Senate’s proposed amendments is putting
Canada’s economic future in jeopardy, and sacrificing the livelihoods of
hundreds of thousands of Canadians by introducing an unworkable Bill that
increases uncertainty for investors and makes it harder for those directly
impacted by projects to participate.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“Today, I
am pleased to congratulate all those in Canada and around the world celebrating
the 74th anniversary of Korea’s independence from colonialism at the end of the
Second World War. Today we recognize the contributions of Canadians of Korean
heritage and recall Canada’s role in the continued preservation of freedom in
South Korea.  
“Canada
played a key role in protecting Korea’s independence in later years. While
those in the North did not get to experience the full benefits of the
liberation, as one form of subjugation was replaced by another that continues
to this day, Canada enjoys a special friendship with the Republic of Korea in
the South. Over 26,000 Canadians served during the Korean War between 1950 and
1953; 516 gave their lives, and thousands were wounded fighting for freedom and
against communist imperialism. More than 7,000 Canadian soldiers also served in
ongoing peace-keeping duties after the signing of the Armistice.
“Canada is
home to a vibrant Korean community, and our friendship with South Korea grows
continually, as highlighted by the Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement negotiated
and implemented by our previous Conservative government in 2015.
“On behalf
of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to everyone
celebrating the 74th anniversary of the Liberation of Korea. 
“Happy
National Liberation Day of Korea!”

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Lakeland, AB – Shannon Stubbs, Shadow Minister for Natural Resources, issued the following statement on Minister Sohi attending the Energy and Mines Ministers’ Conference in Cranbrook, British Columbia: 
“This week, Minister Sohi has the opportunity to listen to his provincial counterparts instead of ignoring the continued calls of the Premiers to cancel the Liberals’ job killing carbon tax, reverse the anti-resource and anti-pipeline Bill C-69, end the oil export ban Bill C-48, and give back power over economic development to the North that the Liberals removed in Bill C-88. 
 “If Prime Minister Trudeau’s Liberals are serious about making Canada’s energy and mining sectors competitive, Minister Sohi would commit to immediately scrapping Bill C-69 and axing the carbon tax in front of his provincial and territorial partners this week. But Prime Minister Trudeau’s Liberals won’t, because they always put the special interests of a small group of anti-resource and anti-energy activists ahead of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who work in Canada’s natural resource sectors. 
 “There is no region of this country that the Liberals’ anti-resource development agenda has not harmed: from offshore drilling in Atlantic Canada, to oil and gas development in the North, to mining in Quebec, Ontario and BC, and oil and gas development across Western Canada. The Liberals imposed new taxes, increased red-tape, created uncertainty and chaos for project developers, all at the cost of good-paying Canadian jobs – putting Canada at a disadvantage against international competitors. 
 “The Liberal plan to kill Canada’s resource industries is no surprise. Prime Minister Trudeau has been open about his plan to ‘phase-out’ the oil and gas sector, and feels the need to apologize to his international billionaire friends for Canada’s environmentally and socially responsible natural resources. 
 “The Liberals rammed through a carbon tax that makes new mines and resource development in rural and remote communities less competitive. The ‘no more pipelines’ Bill C-69 kills jobs, drives away investment, and already cost our economy billions. Bill C-48 blocks Western Canadian oil from international markets, while doing nothing to stop foreign imported oil from countries with terrible environmental and human rights records. The Liberals also prohibited resource development on wide swaths of northern land – without consultation and without warning.   
















“Canada’s
Conservatives will always stand with struggling families who rely on Canada’s
natural resource jobs. Conservatives will scrap the ‘no more pipelines’ Bill
C-69, axe the carbon tax, and give certainty to the private sector to get
pipelines built. Conservatives are proud of Canada’s world class production of
natural resources, have a plan to get Canadian resources to global markets, and
will finally help hard working Canadians to get-ahead.”

Scheer to restore order, fairness, and compassion to Canada’s immigration system
A new Conservative government will restore
public confidence in Canada’s immigration system by stopping the flow of
illegal border crossers from the United States and prioritizing newcomers from
the world’s most dangerous countries, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said.
“Canadians’ confidence in the immigration system has been
rocked by Justin Trudeau’s chaos and mismanagement,” Scheer said. “When
everybody follows the rules and the laws are enforced, immigration is good for
the economy, good for jobs, and good for the people who have chosen to come to
Canada.
As Prime Minister, I will take steps to restore confidence
in the system and make sure Canada’s immigration system prioritizes those who
need Canada’s help the most.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Prioritize funding to support immigration services like language training, credential recognition, as      well as services specifically designed for vulnerable newcomers like women, girls, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.Prioritize those who apply to come to Canada through the appropriate immigration streams, especially in the family reunification program.Close the loophole in the Safe Third Country Agreement.Move existing Immigration and Refugee Board judges to common illegal border crossing points, speeding up the process and therefore making it less attractive to enter Canada illegally.Hire an additional 250 CBSA enforcement officers.Listen carefully to provinces on immigration issues, with an aim to work closely to best accommodate their needs and priorities. A Conservative government would be ready to negotiate with the Government of Quebec to discuss the selection of those who wish to settle in Quebec.  We will be open to requests to amend the Canada-Quebec Accord on Immigration.
“These measures will restore fairness and compassion to
our immigration system while providing stronger enforcement of the law at the
border,” said Scheer. “If these measures aren’t taken, confidence in
immigration will continue to slide and legitimate refugees will wait longer and
longer for Canada’s help.”
FACTS:
In 2017, Justin Trudeau created an illegal border crossing crisis in Canada with his #WelcomeToCanada tweet, resulting in more than 50,000 illegal border crossers entering Canada and      costing taxpayers $1.6 billion.A poll in August 2018 found that 65% of Canadians believed the massive influx of illegal border crossers      was a “crisis.”Justin Trudeau has compensated Roxham Road residents $400,000 of taxpayer money for “disruptions” from those crossing the border illegally.Canada is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law, and fundamental and universal human rights, and these values must be reflected in our immigration system.Only a Conservative government will restore compassion and fairness to Canada’s immigration system while protecting and securing our borders.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your      family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax      Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income      Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50%, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians      for green home improvements.

Canadians are looking for relief at the gas pumps. Trudeau is only making it worse.
With Saudi Arabia set to shut down half its crude
production, global oil prices will go through the roof, and take gasoline
prices with them.

What does that mean for you? At the pumps, overnight, you could be paying 12 to
25 cents more for gas.

Canadians just can’t afford that.

The question is: What is Trudeau’s plan?

We know the carbon tax is going up. Trudeau’s
environment minister Cathrine McKenna confirmed it. And just today, Liberal
MP Marco Mendicino refused to
answer questions on how much it will go up. 

Yesterday, Conservatives revealed that Trudeau’s carbon tax hike will add 31
cents a litre to the price of gas. So at a time when gas prices are set to
shoot up, Trudeau’s plan is to actually make it worse.

Andrew Scheer and the Conservative will scrap the carbon tax, putting more
money in your pockets so you can get ahead.

This situation of global uncertainty and speculation is also exactly why Canada
needs to build pipelines to get Canadian oil to global markets and to work to
greater energy independence.

We cannot put the bottom line of Canadians at risk.

Andrew Scheer and Canada’s Conservatives have a plan to build a national energy
corridor and to make Canada energy independent by 2030.

Under the Trudeau Liberals, Canada hasn’t built a single inch of pipeline.
Instead, Justin Trudeau levelled a punishing carbon tax, making Canada’s oil
and gas sector less competitive, further driving up the price of gas for
Canadians.

Justin Trudeau has even gone so far as to say he want to “phase-out” Canada’s
oil and gas sector and that high gas prices are “exactly what we want.”

There are a number of Liberal
candidates, running for Justin Trudeau, who are opposed to any oil and gas
development:
 
Justin Trudeau’s star candidate, Steven Guilbeault, has been on the record a number of times opposing the TMX pipeline expansion.Estelle Hjertaas, the Liberal      candidate in Prince Albert, tweeted “[Justin Trudeau] it’s up to you to      say no to Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain” and “False #oilprice narrative used to scare Canadians into accepting Trans Mountain pipeline expansion”Karina Gould, a Trudeau cabinet minister, tweeted “It’s time to landlock Alberta’s tar sands”

What is Justin Trudeau’s plan to protect Canadian drivers and get Canadian oil
to global markets?

Yesterday Postmedia exposed numerous sexist
comments by Justin Trudeau’s handpicked candidate in Sydney-Victoria, Jamie
Battiste, which were made between 2012-2016.
While some of Battiste’s comments are too inappropriate to

clean, cook and fold laundry.
These comments are disgusting and inexcusable. An
individual who makes this many disparaging comments is not worthy of sitting in

“Despite these sexist comments, Battiste is allowed to run
as a Liberal candidate for Justin Trudeau,” said Lisa Raitt, Conservative

groping a journalist in British Columbia, or throwing strong women out of his
caucus for standing up for the rule-of-law, Trudeau never lives up to his own

“At present, across the country, provinces and territories

jurisdictional inequalities in service deliveries that force families to move
or seek services away from home.
“Canada’s Conservatives believe that the federal
government can play an important role in developing a strategy to assist those

work with autism stakeholders to develop a National Autism Strategy.
“An initial investment of $50 million over five years

 New Conservative government to remove museum admission fees, celebrate past Prime Ministers 
A new Conservative government will scrap
admission fees from all of Canada’s national museums, Conservative Leader
Andrew Scheer announced today.
Removing these fees will make it easier for families to
learn about Canada’s proud history and will make school field trips and family
vacations more affordable.
“National museums celebrate Canada by sharing our
foundational stories and most cherished artifacts, the very things that make us
Canadian. They are places of beauty, discovery, and inspiration,” said Scheer.
“Making them more accessible to Canadians and visitors is part of our plan to
celebrate Canadian culture and make life more affordable for families across
the country.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will make it free to
visit national museums 365 days a year for every visitor.
There are nine national museums across Canada:
Canada Agriculture and Food Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum of History (Gatineau, Quebec)Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 (Halifax, Nova Scotia)Canada Science and Technology Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa, Ontario)Canada Aviation and Space Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum of Nature (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum for Human Rights (Winnipeg, Manitoba)Canadian War Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)
A new Conservative government will also designate the RCMP
Heritage Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan as a national museum. Admission would
also be free.
Scheer announced that a new Conservative government will
also designate the gravesites of past Prime Ministers and Governors General as
national historic sites.
“We can and we should celebrate the achievements of our
historical giants like William Lyon Mackenzie King, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and
Sir John A. Macdonald,” Scheer said. “These leaders, and others, have left
their mark not only on our country, but on the entire world and they are worthy
of honour and respect.”
FACTS:
The first National Museum of Canada was established by the Department of Mines in 1927.The current system of national museums (listed above) are administered by six Crown Corporations.According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, this move would save Canadians more than $20 million per year.Admission fees generally represent small proportions of these museums’ revenue mix; these other revenue streams, including Parliamentary appropriations, will not be impacted by this measure, except to increase the appropriations to compensate for reduced revenue from this policy.Smithsonian Institution museums in Washington, D.C. have offered free admission since 1846.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
OTTAWA, ON
– Today, the Honourable Andrew Scheer, the Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and
of the Official Opposition, issued the following statement regarding Justin
Trudeau’s Carbon Tax:
 
“Justin Trudeau pretends he has a plan for climate change but its clear
that his Carbon Tax will not even come close to achieving Canada’s emissions
reductions targets.  The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) confirmed
today that his plan is not as advertised. 
 
“Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would need to be $102 per tonne in order to reach
Canada’s Paris targets. That’s five times more expensive than it is today,
meaning Canadians will pay more for groceries, home heating and gasoline prices
will jump 23 cents a litre.
 
“The Liberal Carbon Tax isn’t a plan to lower emissions, it’s just another cash
grab which is hurting already over taxed Canadians.  That is why my first
act as Prime Minister will be to scrap the Carbon Tax, leaving more money in
Canadians’ pockets, so that they can get ahead.
 
“I will also be unveiling A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment on June
19.  Unlike the Liberal plan, which is not an environmental plan but a
plan to raises taxes on Canadians, our Conservative plan will take meaningful
action to protect our environment while protecting Canadian taxpayers.”

OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues statement to mark the Anniversary of India’s Independence:
“Today, Canadians of Indian descent and the Indian diaspora around the world celebrate the 73rd year of India’s Independence.
“This anniversary represents how India has long been an example of political freedoms and economic opportunity, as it continues to play an important role on the world stage. Boasting a population of over 1 billion people, India’s presence on the international stage and increasing economic development have helped foster international peace and security and helped millions of people to rise out of poverty.
“Canada’s relationship with India has been longstanding, and our two countries have much in common as fellow nations of the Commonwealth, including our shared history and our common values of democracy, pluralism, and economic development.  I was honoured to visit India this past fall to meet with Prime Minister Modi and other Indian governmental, business, and civil leaders, to highlight the importance of this critical relationship.
“Today, over one million people of Indian descent from many different religious and cultural communities call Canada home. The Indo-Canadian community has made tremendous contributions to our country’s success in areas of art, trade, business, technological advancements, and education, helping to keep it strong and prosperous.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I extend my best wishes to everyone celebrating the anniversary of India’s Independence!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Edmonton, AB – Today, the Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and Leader of the Official Opposition, said as Prime Minister he would work with the provinces to implement the Interprovincial Free Trade Agreement (IFTA), a new agreement that will create free trade between provinces and territories.
“My goal will be simple: A brand new and truly free interprovincial trade agreement. The Interprovincial Free Trade Agreement,” Scheer said.
Scheer made the proposal in his fourth My Vision For Canada speech today in Edmonton. Called A Stronger and Freer Federation, the speech outlined Scheer’s vision for how to strengthen Canadian confederation to benefit Canadians.
“To do it, I will appoint a Minister of Interprovincial Trade, whose sole responsibility will be to lead the negotiations and the implementation. I am not talking about an accord or a pact or a memorandum of understanding. This will be nothing like the half-hearted attempts at improving internal trade that have marked our recent history. The Interprovincial Free Trade Agreement will be a free trade deal. Like NAFTA. Like CETA. Like the TPP. Negotiated freely in the spirit of open federalism, with nothing more than the basic promise of greater prosperity bringing all parties to the table.”
Scheer promised to convene a First Minister’s meeting within the first 100 days of a new Conservative government with a new trade agreement at the top of the agenda.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Regina, SK
– The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the
Official Opposition, issued a statement following former Liberal cabinet
minister and Justin Trudeau’s former Ambassador to China John McCallum’s recent
comments on the ongoing China-Canada dispute:
 
“I forcefully and unequivocally condemn recent comments by high-profile
Liberals encouraging the Chinese government to help re-elect the government
this October. This invitation of foreign interference in the Canadian election
– to a regime that has proven itself hostile to Canadian interests – is
absolutely reprehensible.
 
“I also find it appalling that Liberals are attempting to win favour with a
communist government that is illegally detaining two Canadian citizens and
blocking Canadian agricultural imports. Instead of scheming with the Government
of China to win re-election, Liberals should advocate for the safe return of
Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and the restoration of Canadian canola and
meat imports to China.
 
“That Justin Trudeau appointed John McCallum – someone who has repeatedly
advocated against Canada’s interests – to one of Canada’s most important
diplomatic posts demonstrates his incompetence and poor judgment on the world
stage.
 
“However, this latest episode is not particularly surprising considering
Trudeau’s admiration for the Chinese communist regime – or China’s ‘basic
dictatorship,’ as he once put it. As Prime Minister, he has continually failed
to stand up for Canadian interests and has instead chosen to appease the
Government of China at every turn. This approach has failed.
 
“A new Conservative government will always stand up for Canada’s interests on
the world stage and will not allow any country that wishes us harm to push us
around.”

Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act could help 35,000 more Canadians with disabilities
A new Conservative government will introduce the Fairness for
Persons with Disabilities Act, allowing 35,000 more Canadians to qualify and
apply for the Disability Tax Credit, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today. 
This new Act will reduce the number of hours spent per week on
life-sustaining therapy needed to qualify for the credit from 14 to 10. It will
also expand the definition of what counts as life-sustaining therapy to include
determining dosages of medical food and activities related to determining dosages
of medication, including dietary or exercise regimes. This would allow 35,000
more Canadians with disabilities the potential to access savings of an average
of $2,100 a year.
“A new Conservative government will support Canadians with
disabilities in ways that leave more money in their pockets to help them manage
their health needs,” Scheer said. “We will make sure that Canadians with a
disability can care for themselves and parents of children with disabilities can
support their children without worrying about their bottom line.”
Under our policy, a Canadian with type
1 diabetes who currently spends an average of 10 hours per week managing his or
her condition would qualify for the Disability Tax Credit.
In 2017, Justin Trudeau changed how Canadians qualify for the
Disability Tax Credit and the Registered Disability Savings Plan, stripping
important financial support from thousands of Canadians with disabilities.
“Trudeau
has made life more expensive for all Canadians, including those with
disabilities,” Scheer said. “A new Conservative government will live within its
means. We will lower your taxes and put more money in your pocket so you can worry
less about your bottom line and focus on living life to your full potential.” 
Conservative MP Tom Kmiec introduced the Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act in 2018 but the bill did
not pass before parliament was dissolved.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home      heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up      to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of families who make green-home improvements.

Today, Justin
Trudeau and the Liberals are unveiling their election platform – much like the
2015 version it’s not worth the wasted ink and the paper it’s printed on. 
In the last
election, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals promised a lot, but once elected they
broke promise after promise and made life more expensive and unaffordable for
families. Plain and simple, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. If Justin
Trudeau is re-elected he will once again break his promises to Canadians and
raise taxes on hard-working Canadian families. 
Let’s take a
look at some of Justin Trudeau’s most notable broken promises. 
Balanced
Budgets: 
“I am
looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way I always have. We’ve
said we are committed to balanced budgets and we are. We will balance that
budget in 2019.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
It’s 2019, and
as we can see the budget did not “balance itself.” Justin Trudeau is running
endless deficits that threaten the social services Canadians depend on and if
re-elected Trudeau will just raise your taxes to pay for his out of control
spending. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Electoral
Reform: 
“As Prime
Minister, I’ll make sure the 2015 election will be the last under
first-past-the-post system.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
There’s another
election, and guess what? It’s being held under first-past-the-post. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Veterans: 
“Our plan
will give back to those who have given so much in service to all Canadians, and
will ensure that no veteran has to fight the government for the support and compensation
they have earned.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election Platform
Justin Trudeau
looked a military hero in the eye – a man who lost his leg fighting for our
country – and said that veterans are “asking for more than we are able to
give.” 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Accountability:

“We will
restore trust in our democracy.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election
Platform
Justin Trudeau
was the first Prime Minister in our country’s history to be found guilty of
breaking ethics laws, and he did it not once but twice! 
Justin Trudeau
has stonewalled the Ethics Commissioner, shut-down parliamentary committees
search for answers into Liberal corruption scandals, and he is now doing
everything in his power to block the RCMP from investigating his office. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Lower Taxes
for the Middle Class: 
“We will
give middle class Canadians a tax break.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015
Election Platform
Justin Trudeau
has raised taxes on 80 per cent of middle-class families, and his carbon tax
punishes everyday moms and dads driving their kids to hockey practice. 
If Justin
Trudeau is re-elected, his carbon tax is going to increase the price of
gasoline by 31 cents per litre.

“Today, I am happy to join Christians from different
traditions across Canada in celebrating the Assumption.” 
“The feast of the Assumption, also known as the Dormition of
the Virgin Mary, is a day of joy for many Catholic, Orthodox, and other
Christian communities across the country, celebrating the Blessed Virgin’s
entrance into heaven at the end of her earthly life, a sign to all of the
redemptive power found in Jesus Christ. 
Celebrated in different traditions and cultures and known by
many different names across Canada, the celebration of the Assumption is a
symbol of our diversity in unity. 
“Canada is blessed with devout and diverse Christian
Communities. On holy days, such as today, we are especially grateful for their
contributions to our nation’s heritage, culture and traditions.”

my best wishes for a blessed feast day to everyone celebrating across the
country.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Prince George, B.C. — Todd Doherty, Conservative Shadow Minister for Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, released the following statement today regarding the Trudeau government’s announcement for the Canadian Coast Guard:
“While Conservatives support the much-needed procurement of new ships for the Canadian Coast Guard, we are concerned that the Liberals have waited until the last minute to make this announcement and have no plan to actually deliver. Just like we saw with their defence plan, the Liberals continue to make big spending promises, with no plan to actually pay for them.
“The Liberal record on shipbuilding is abysmal. There have been numerous delays because of Liberal mismanagement, which has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. This includes repeated extensions to the design competition for the Canadian Surface Combatant. Justin Trudeau has also refused to award the conversion contract for the second supply ship, Obélix, to the Davie shipyard despite the fact that they delivered the Astérix on time and on budget.
“Our previous Conservative government was proud to launch the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy, to deliver the ships our men and women in uniform need and deserve. However, clearly more must be done. No Canadian shipyard should be sitting idle. The Canadian Coast Guard needs new ships, especially heavy icebreakers, as soon as possible.
“Conservatives have been pressuring the Trudeau government for years on this very issue. With the longest coast line in the world and oldest coast guard fleet, it is about time this Liberals took notice. Conservatives will continue to support the Canadian Coast Guard to ensure that they get the ships they need to keep Canadians safe, while ensuring the best value for taxpayers.”

Scheer is confirmed to attend both the commissioner
English (Oct. 7) and French (Oct. 10) debates. Scheer is also confirmed to

Munk Debate on foreign policy on Oct. 1.
Why won’t Justin Trudeau attend the Maclean’s/CityTV

Just because Trudeau has a lot to run away and hide from
doesn’t mean he should.
He has made life harder and more unaffordable for families
– bringing in a carbon tax and raising taxes on 80% of middle class families.
He is the first Prime Minister in Canadian history to be
found guilty of breaking ethics laws – not once, but twice.
He has been incredibly weak on the world stage – backing
down to Donald Trump on NAFTA, humiliating Canada and severely damaging
relations with India, and failing to stand up for Canada’s interests in China.
And, he has broken promise after promise to the Canadian
people.
Plain and simple, he is not as advertised.
Trudeau should stand before Canadians and answer for these
failures. Instead, he’s running away.
Andrew Scheer is planning to hold Justin Trudeau accountable on the debate-stage while highlighting his own plan to help Canadians get ahead. It’s time for Justin Trudeau to stop hiding.

The Conservative Party of Canada announced country music
singer George Canyon will be the Conservative Party of Canada candidate in the
riding of Central Nova for the federal election. Canyon, originally from Pictou
County, Nova Scotia, has won multiple Canadian Country Music Association, East
Coast Music, and Juno Awards, along with volunteer honours from Diabetes Canada
for his advocacy bringing attention to diabetes.  
“I’m excited to add somebody of George’s experience and
talent to the Conservative team,” said Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives. “Central Nova is George’s home riding and he understands
the challenges people there face trying to get ahead. As their MP, I know he
will work hard to make sure they are heard in Ottawa.”
Canyon’s family, wife Jennifer, and children Kale and
Madison, have always come first in his life, and his passion for Nova Scotia
has never waned throughout his career. He is a Nova Scotia Country Music Hall
of Fame inductee, but more importantly, a Type-1 Diabetic that has used his
platform to bring attention to diabetes research. 
“Excited doesn’t even begin to describe what I’m feeling
today as I become the Conservative candidate for Central Nova,” said George
Canyon. “I believe that if you work hard, you should be able to buy a home,
save for retirement, and care for your children and aging parents, and I want
to be part of a team that understands that. Afterall, it’s hard enough to get
ahead without the government making it harder. Over the next nine weeks, I’m
going to wear the soles out of my boots as I work hard to show people here the
type of representative and advocate I will be for them.” 
Canyon has also been made an Honorary Colonel for 14 Wing
Greenwood Air Force Base in Nova Scotia in 2008 and was appointed the first
ever Colonel Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. He’s a proud Nova
Scotian and huge hockey fan, and is in his sixth season singing the national
anthem during Calgary Flames home games. 
“We’re all completely behind George, and eager to get to
work as we show how a Conservative government will help people get ahead, not
just get by,” said Ryan Sharpe, Central Nova Conservative Association
President. “I’m confident Central Nova will get the attention it deserves from
our federal government with George as our Member of Parliament, and I know our
grassroots volunteers and supporters fully support his campaign.” 
With Canyon in place as the candidate, the Conservative

Canada. Election Day is October 21, 2019.

The Honourable Andrew

letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this morning calling on him to scrap
his secret fuel tax.
The following is an excerpt from the letter:“Your carbon tax has
already increased the cost of gasoline by five cents a litre. This has made it
more expensive for moms and dads to drive to their kids to soccer practice, for
seniors to get to their doctors appointments, for farmers to plant their crops,
and for small business owners to serve their customers. Everyday essentials
like groceries and home heating have also become more expensive, meaning more
Canadians are just getting by, instead of getting ahead.Your secret fuel tax will
undoubtedly increase the cost of gasoline by at least another four cents a
litre, a fact you continue to hide. It is also an unprecedented tax that will
apply to all fuel sources, including the fuel used for manufacturing and home
heating, which will make Canadian businesses less competitive and gas more
expensive.”
The letter goes on to say:“Prime Minister, Canadians
are tired of your government’s never-ending tax hikes and deserve to know the
truth. You promised transparency, but yet again are not as advertised.Given these facts, will
you scrap your secret fuel tax?I can assure you that this

“Of course, Trudeau has set the tone for this government. He was the first

Yesterday, Justin Trudeau was interviewed by

economic record and ethical scandals.
“Trudeau claimed he lowered taxes on the middle-class. In
fact, he raised taxes on 80% of middle-class families and brought in a carbon
tax that makes gasoline, groceries, and home heating even more expensive.
“Trudeau also claimed that he supports first-time home
buyers, when in fact he will raise their taxes even higher as a result of his
endless deficits.
“Trudeau tried to assure reporters he wants to restore
confidence in government institutions, but he used the power of his office to
reward his supporters and punish his critics.
“Most absurdly, Justin Trudeau lied about why he broke
federal law, when he claimed that his motivation during the SNC corruption
scandal was to save jobs. This was simply a made up talking point by the
Liberal Party of Canada. What’s worse, when he was challenged to show evidence,
Trudeau could not answer a direct question about where the 9,000 jobs number
came from.
“Under Justin Trudeau, the scandals will continue and life
will get even more unaffordable. He is not as advertised.
“In contrast, a new Conservative government led by Prime
Minister Andrew Scheer will follow and respect the law, all while living within
its means, and putting more money in your pocket so you can get ahead.”

The reason for this pressure was reportedly due to the ‘election environment’ and therefore Mr. Mulroney had to be ‘very, very careful’.   “This exchange is highly inappropriate and represents a blatant attempt by Justin Trudeau to muzzle a respected former career diplomat. Trudeau has shown a clear pattern of silencing those who speak out.   “Justin Trudeau once said he admires China’s ‘basic dictatorship’, but this is not how things are done in Canada.   “This also raises questions as to whether or not officials have been ordered by Trudeau’s PMO to speak with former Ambassador to China, and former Trudeau cabinet minister, John McCallum. Mr. McCallum has made a number of inappropriate statements over the past year – including his comments on Canada’s extradition process and his encouragement of Chinese foreign interference in the upcoming election.   “As Mr. Mulroney stated, discouraging private citizens with expertise in foreign relations from speaking freely is ‘fundamentally an undemocratic idea’.

“As the Ethics Commissioner notes in his report, “the authority of the Prime
Minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine, and ultimately
discredit,” Jody Wilson-Raybould.
 
“He promised he would be open and honest. But let’s remember on the day this

Wilson-Raybould.  We know now that is false.  He also said that she
never came to him with her concerns.  Again, we know now that was
false.  And he said that he would be happy to work and cooperate with the
Ethics Commissioner.  And now we know that is false as well.
 
“He promised he would be different.  Instead, we now know, beyond a shadow
of a doubt, that Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.  He has stated so
many falsehoods that no one can believe anything he says.
 
“Trudeau may never face a court of law for his role in this scandal, but he
will have to face the Canadian people over the next few weeks.
 
“And on the eve of this election, the choice before Canadians has never been
more clear. Between a Prime Minister who abuses his power, bends the law for
his friends, attempts to silence his critics and destroys their
reputations.  And a Conservative government led by a Prime Minister who
will uphold the rule of law, respect our democratic institutions, and help all
Canadians get ahead.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues the following statement on Korean War Veterans Day, marking the 66th anniversary of the signing of the Korean War Armistice: 
“On this day every year, it is a fitting occasion for Canada to reflect on the sacrifices made by courageous Canadian soldiers, sailors, and airmen during the Korean War. 
“Over 26,000 Canadian Armed Forces personnel joined together with our allies to fight against a violent communist regime. Today, we mark 66 years since the signing of the armistice on July 27th, 1953, which ended the hostilities. More than 7,000 Canadians continued to serve in related peacekeeping duties over the decades that followed.  
“Today, we honour the veterans who bravely fought for peace and who risked their lives in the name of freedom. We also remember the 516 Canadians who gave their lives in this fight for freedom. Their ultimate sacrifice will forever be remembered and honoured by Canada. 
“I encourage all Canadians to take the time to reflect on the lessons of the Korean War and show their gratitude to our veterans who sacrificed everything to protect the fundamental values that we hold so dear. 
“Lest we forget.”

New Military Covenant will clear backlog for Veterans’ benefits within 24 months
Canadian Veterans struggling with months-long waits
for pensions and benefits can count on a new Conservative government to take
immediate action to get them the support they deserve.
Andrew Scheer, leader of Canada’s Conservatives,
announced a comprehensive plan today to deliver more help to Canada’s Veterans
in a timely and respectful manner.
“To every Veteran who has struggled and who
continues to struggle without the support and benefits you have earned through
your service, my message is this: You deserve better. After October 21, we are
going to make things better,” Scheer said. “Instead of forcing Veterans to work
harder for government benefits, it’s time the government worked harder for our Veterans’
benefit. It’s time for a government that works harder for you; it’s time for
you to get ahead.”
Scheer highlighted that a new Conservative
government will:
Enshrine, in legislation, a Military Covenant between the Government of
Canada and all Canada’s Veterans. This will guarantee that every Veteran is
treated with respect and is provided services in a timely manner.Clear the current backlog of Veterans’ benefit applications within 24
months.Create a reliable, dependable pension system that, unlike the Liberal
status quo, is fair to Canada’s most disabled Veterans.Strengthen transition services to support discharged or retired Canadian
Armed Forces members.Strike an independent inquiry to provide answers about Canadian Armed
Forces members who were administered mefloquine.Provide more service dogs to Canadian Veterans in their communities.Put vital
commemoration projects, like the National Memorial for Canada’s War in
Afghanistan, back on track.
“These actions are simple, straightforward, and
practical,” said Scheer. “They require new investment from a new government, but
even more importantly, they require new priorities.  Our military heroes are deserving. Our
military heroes are worth it.”
In 2015, Justin Trudeau promised that no Veteran
would have to “fight the government for the support and compensation they have
earned.”  Yet under the Trudeau Liberals
the number of Veterans left stranded on government waitlists had ballooned to
40,000 – a growth of over 33 per cent. Worst of all, Trudeau continues to fight
Veterans in court, and has dismissed their concerns saying, “They’re asking for
more than we are able to give.”
“Justin Trudeau never turned back SNC-Lavalin’s
lobbyists or claimed they were ‘asking for more than he was able give’,” said Scheer.
“When corporate lobbyists get the red carpet while Veterans get left out in the
cold, it’s proof that Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.”
“To our Veterans, whether you are among the
vanishing generations of heroes who served in 
World War II and the Korean War, or whether you are one of the heroes of
Afghanistan or conflict zones around the world, you deserve our gratitude,”
said Scheer.  
“When we look out for our Veterans, we are looking
out for the people who dedicated their lives to looking out for us. It’s time
for government that will stand up for our Veterans. It’s time for a
Conservative government that will help you get ahead.”

conservative,https://www.conservative.ca/scheer-introduces-cyber-security-measures-to-protect-your-personal-data/,"
Today, the Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives,
announced the measures he would take, as Prime Minister, to safeguard
Canadians’ personal data online. 
 
“The Trudeau Liberal government has been particularly careless on this front,”
said Scheer at the Montreal Chamber of Commerce. “Just recently a Quebec
company made headlines, but they are not the only casualty to this crime. Many
Canadian companies are at risk of being the next victims of these criminals.”
 
“It’s past-time the federal government did something to protect Canadians’
information online,” said Scheer.
 
Increasingly, parts of our lives, important interactions and transactions are
moved online. Paying your monthly bills, transferring money between accounts,
making large purchases, and investing is all done with the click of a button or
the tap of a device. It is vital, that the government adopt new policies and
keep up with technology to make sure that Canadians – their money and their
personal information – is protected. 
 
A Conservative government would take a three-pronged approach to this issue:
sensible regulation, standards and education to ensure that consumers can make
informed decisions, and strong oversight at the highest levels of
government.  
We will ensure that plain language use agreements are put in place so that companies collecting electronic data must receive informed consent from Canadians.We will apply regulatory standards for the ethical and secure use of      artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and create the Canada      Cyber Safe brand to ensure that consumers know when products have met rigorous security standards.An expert committee with industry leaders will define binding cyber security standards for critical infrastructure sectors and penalties for non-compliance.
“As Prime Minister, I
will also establish a Cabinet Committee on Cyber Security and Data Privacy and
conduct periodic cyber security penetration testing on all government
departments and establish performance benchmarks for senior public servants,”
said Scheer. 
 
FACTS : 

Today, Canadians are connected more than ever before, sharing and storing personal information online. Only thirty-four per cent of companies have data protection and control measures.Fifty-four per cent of Canadian businesses were affected by cybersecurity incidents that prevented employees from doing their jobs.Justin Trudeau’s Government has failed to take meaningful action on this front and we have seen numerous incidents impacting millions of Canadians.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 
Regina, SK
– The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the
Official Opposition, released the following statement regarding the resignation
of the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff Paul Wynnyk:
 
“Justin Trudeau’s meddling and political interference has created
unprecedented chaos in the Canadian Armed Forces. In four years, he has
destroyed the careers of two of our country’s most senior military
officers and caused instability and turmoil at the highest levels of the
military.
 
“Vice-Admiral Mark Norman gave 38 years of his life in service to our great
country. He served with honour and integrity, even in the face of Trudeau’s
disgusting smear campaign against him.
 
“Despite everything that has come out, there remain serious and credible questions
about the Trudeau Liberals’ political interference in the Norman prosecution.
Now, as a direct result of Trudeau’s interference, we have once again lost
our military’s second-in-command. Like Mr. Norman, Paul Wynnyk is an
accomplished and dedicated military officer who has been caught in the middle
of Trudeau’s incompetence and poor judgment.
 
“The brave men and women who serve our country as a part of the Canadian Armed
Forces deserve stability and respect. Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau and
the Liberals have continually put their political self-interests ahead of the
heroes who put their lives on the line for our freedom.
 
“This is wrong and unconscionable. We must do better. Justin Trudeau promised
to be different, but clearly he is not as advertised. Under my leadership a
Conservative government will do better.”
 
Unanswered Questions
in the Norman Affair:
Why did the Liberals go to such great lengths to withhold evidence from Mark      Norman’s defence team?
How much are Canadian taxpayers on the hook for Trudeau’s settlement with      Mark Norman?
Was this all a part of an expensive scheme to cover-up Justin Trudeau’s political problems before an election?

serving in a range of roles – both in opposition and in government – as a
Canadian Alliance and then Conservative MP. He was always a champion for his

“Deepak was a constant source of joy inside the Conservative caucus. He
brightened every room he walked into and often injected warmth, kindness, and

“Personally, I will always have fond memories of the time we spent together
during the Conservative Party of Canada leadership race. In addition to the

New tax credit will allow Canadians to save up to $3,800 on green home renovations
Conservative
Leader Andrew Scheer was at Potvin & Bouchard today, highlighting the Conservatives’
proposed Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, a two-year program to encourage
homeowners to renovate their homes in ways that lower their power bills and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Canadians
will be eligible to receive a 20% refundable credit on their income tax for
green improvements to their homes of over $1,000 and up to $20,000. This would
allow Canadians to save up to $3,800
on their renovations each year.
Eligible renovations would include: 
Installation of high-quality insulation Investments in high-efficiency furnaces Replacement of doors and windows with more efficient models Upgrading of ventilation, heating and cooling systemsInstallation of solar panels 
In
2017, emissions from buildings represented 12% of Canada’s overall emissions. 
“No
environmental plan is complete without a serious plan to tackle emissions from
buildings,” Scheer said. “Our Green Home Renovation Tax Credit will help lower
these emissions and fight climate change while putting more money in Canadians’
pockets so they can get ahead.”
This measure is one of the 55 policies of our environmental plan, A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment, introduced earlier this year. It is a realistic plan that balances Canada’s obligation to fight climate change with the core Conservative promise to put more money in Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead.
FACTS:
Justin Trudeau’s signature so-called environmental policy is, in reality, not an environmental policy at all. His Carbon Tax gives big polluters a pass while punishing Canadians for driving to work and heating their homes.Canadian families and small businesses pay 92% of Trudeau’s Carbon Tax, while big polluters are only on the hook for 8%. Justin Trudeau and his environment minister have confirmed that a carbon tax hike is on the table, and the Conservative Party conducted research to determine just how much it would cost the average Canadian household. At the $102/ tonne level, Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would Increase the cost of natural gas by $469 per year Add 31 cents/litre to the price of gasoline. This means $2/litre gasoline is just around the corner if the Trudeau Liberals are re-elected. It is Canadians who bear the cost of Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax. In Ontario, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,151.In New Brunswick, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $959.In Manitoba, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,116.In Saskatchewan, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,930.In Alberta, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $2,002.
Andrew Scheer’s Plan for you to get ahead:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax,
lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut,
saving an average couple $850 per
year.Take the GST off home
heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public
Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free,
putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness
Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports
activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts

Reducing lowest-income tax bracket will put more than $850 back into the pockets of an average Canadian family
The
average Canadian family will save over $850 per year on their income taxes
after a Conservative government reduces the rate of the lowest-income tax
bracket with the Universal Tax Cut, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today.
“It’s
time for a universal tax cut that is focused on you,” said Scheer. “We’re going
to deliver a tax cut targeted specifically at taxpayers in the lowest-income
tax bracket. This means that every Canadian will see their income taxes go
down, and those in the lowest tax bracket see the biggest benefit of all.”
With
the Universal Tax Cut, the tax rate on income under $47,630 will be reduced
from 15 per cent to 13.75 per cent. This will allow an individual taxpayer to
save as much as $440 on their taxes. A two-income couple earning an average
salary would save over $850 per year.  
“That’s
$850 back in your pocket each and every year,” said Scheer. “This means more
money to pay the bills, to save up for your kids’ education or maybe even
finally afford a family vacation.”
Scheer
compared the Universal Tax Cut to the Trudeau Liberal record. Despite
campaigning on a promise to help the middle class, Justin Trudeau refused to
reduce the low-income tax bracket. Instead, the Liberals increased taxes on
essentials like transit passes, textbooks, and after school programs for kids,
while introducing a carbon tax that targets lower income families by increasing
the cost of gasoline, home heating and groceries. Today, 80 per cent of
Canadian middle-class families are paying an average of $800 more per year in
tax compared to when Trudeau was elected.
“Justin
Trudeau is not as advertised,” said Scheer. “Justin Trudeau has always been
able to find millions of dollars to hand out to well-connected corporations.
Under the Liberals, the more you have, the more you get. That’s not how
government should work.”
The
Universal Tax Cut is the next step in the Conservative plan to put more money
back in your pockets. Scheer has already announced that a Conservative
government will:
Cancel the Trudeau Carbon Tax.Take the GST off home heating, saving an
average household $107.Make all maternity benefits tax free, saving
new parents up to $4000. Introduce a Green Public Transit Tax Credit,
saving a family hundreds of dollars per year. 
“You
shouldn’t have to be a billionaire to get your government’s attention. Instead
you deserve a government that respects how hard you work and how much you
already pay,” said Scheer. “You deserve a Conservative government whose first priority
will be to help you get ahead.”

Ottawa, ON

Conservative Shadow Minister for Natural Resources, released a statement
following the final vote on Bill C-48 in the Senate:
 
“Today is a bad day for Canada’s energy sector and the entire Canadian economy.
Bill C-48 will help landlock Canadian energy exports and cost the Canadian
economy billions of dollars. It will rob Indigenous communities in Northern BC
and across the Prairies of potential economic development opportunities.
 
“This bill is an open and transparent attack on Canada’s oil and gas sector. It
is an anti-pipeline bill poorly masquerading as an environmental bill.
Environmental legislation should be based on science, but Bill C-48 is not. The
Liberals announced it 25 days after the 2015 election, with no consultation of
Indigenous communities, no scientific evidence, and no environmental, safety,
or economic independent analysis. Rather, it is part of Justin Trudeau’s intent
to ‘phase out’ Canada’s oil.

“The Nisga’a, the Lax Kw’alaams, the 35 First Nations along the potential Eagle
Spirit energy corridor, and hundreds of other Indigenous communities and
Indigenous-owned businesses, oppose Bill C-48.
 
“Nine premiers and all three territories raised grave concerns with Justin
Trudeau’s anti-energy policies and their severe impact on the Canadian economy.
Instead of engaging the premiers, and accepting their constructive solutions,
Justin Trudeau ignored and dismissed them, along with the millions of Canadians
they represent, and rammed through C-48 and C-69 in the dying days of
Parliament.
 
“While Justin Trudeau is dividing Canadians, killing pipeline projects, and
forcing Canadians to pay his job killing Carbon Tax, Andrew Scheer has a plan
to unite Canadians, advance economic reconciliation with Indigenous peoples,
use green technology instead of taxes to lower Canada’s emissions, lower global
emissions by exporting Canada’s world class technology and ethically-produced
natural resources, and get Canada’s energy sector back to work. That is why an
Andrew Scheer lead Conservative government in will repeal Bill C-49.”

According to B’nai
Brith Canada, Justin Trudeau’s candidate Iqra Khalid continues to associate
with known anitsemite Amin El-Maoued, who advocates for violence and
discrimination against the Jewish community.




Khalid was forced to apologize last year for giving
El-Maoued a certificate of appreciation from Justin Trudeau. At the time Khalid
claimed she condemned his antisemitic views. 
But we now know her apology was a lie.
Recently Khalid attended an event at the home
of El-Maoued. He confirmed in social media posts that Khalid apologized to him
for condemning his antisemitism. El-Maoued blames the “Zionist lobby” for
forcing Khalid to having to issue a public apology.
In response to this news, Khalid says that she
accepts that El-Maoued is not antisemtic, despite the fact that he uses
antisemitic language and leads rallies to call for the destruction of Israel.
El-Maoued is active in the Liberal Party of
Canada, donating and attending party conventions with Justin Trudeau.
Antisemites like Khalid and El-Maoued feel they
have a home in Trudeau’s Liberal Party. 
But what Jewish Canadians are asking is: why did Justin Trudeau fire antisemite Hassan Guillet but continues to support Iqra Khalid?

Toronto, ON –
The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the
Official Opposition, issued the following statement regarding the decision by
the Court of Appeal of Ontario today:

“I agree with Justice Huscroft’s statement that ‘Parliament cannot insist that
its preferred means of dealing with a problem be implemented by the provinces
when that means encroaches on provincial lawmaking authority.’

“Ontarians have said loud and clear that they do not want Justin Trudeau’s
Carbon Tax. The governments of Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and New
Brunswick are each fighting the Liberal Carbon Tax and pushing back against
Trudeau’s so-called environment plan.

“When it comes to climate change, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. His
unfair Carbon Tax gives big polluters a pass and punishes Canadians for driving
to work and heating their homes. Under his plan, major emitters only pay 8% of
the total revenue collected by the carbon tax and the remaining 92% is paid for
by families and small businesses across the country.

“Every day, Canada gets further and further away from meeting the Paris
targets. Not only is the gap widening but the Parliamentary Budget Officer has
said that Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would have to increase five-times to meet the Paris
targets – making life even more unaffordable for Canadians.

“The good news is that after October 21st, provinces will no longer have to
fight the Liberal Carbon Tax in court.  My first action as Prime Minister
will be to scrap Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax and help Canadians get ahead.

“Just last week I released A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment. Our plan is
Canada’s best chance to meet the Paris targets and balances the need for Canada
to fight climate change and lower emissions with our core promise of leaving
more money in Canadians pockets and letting them get ahead.”

Justin Trudeau to distract from his scandals. 
Trudeau’s Liberals promised pharmacare in 1997
and 2004. They broke their promise then and Justin Trudeau will do it again.
Trudeau cannot be trusted and he is not as advertised.
The proof that he plans to break his promise is
found in the fact that Trudeau is only offering a fraction of the funding
needed to achieve universal pharmacare coverage.  
To pay for his massive deficits, Justin Trudeau
will cut health care funding or raise taxes on middle-class families. Liberal
cuts are exactly what happened in the 1990s, cuts Trudeau said he supported. 
Only Andrew Scheer and the Conservative Party
can be trusted to maintain and increase health care spending by 3% per year.
Under a new Conservative government, Canadians will be able to count on stable
and predictable health and social program funding.

Trudeau Liberals’ have put home ownership further out of reach for Canadians
Today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced that a new Conservative
government would introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time
homebuyers to buy a home.
“With his poor judgement and tax hikes, Justin Trudeau has put the
dream of home ownership further out of reach for so many, especially young
Canadians,” Scheer said. “As Prime Minister, I will fix his bad policies and
work to get more homes on the market to lower the price of housing.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will: 
Fix the mortgage stress test to ensure that first-time homebuyers aren’t unnecessarily prevented from accessing mortgages and work with OSFI to remove the stress test from mortgage renewals to give homeowners more options. Increase amortization periods on insured mortgages to 30 years for first-time homebuyers to lower monthly payments. Launch an inquiry into money laundering in the real estate sector and work with our industry partners to root out corrupt practices that inflate housing prices. Make surplus federal real estate available for development to increase the supply of housing. 
Canada’s
Conservatives know the government has an important role to play to put home
ownership within reach for more Canadians. When you work hard, save, and invest
in your future, the government should help you – not stand in your way. 
FACTS
New data shows the country’s youngest
buyers are affected most by the Trudeau Liberals’
stress test.Justin Trudeau’s latest homebuyer “incentive” has
so many terms and conditions that most first-time homebuyers don’t qualify.
What’s more, it only targets select cities.Right now, more than 80
per cent of middle-income families are paying $800 more in taxes a year than
they did in 2015. The cost of housing continues to skyrocket, and the carbon
tax means that everyday necessities like gas, groceries and heating your home
keep getting more and more expensive. It’s harder than ever before to save for
a down payment or monthly bills. Justin Trudeau has proven that he
can’t be trusted to help Canadians get ahead. If he’s given four more years,
his carbon tax will cost Canadians hundreds of dollars a year. Life is
expensive enough for Canadian families without Justin Trudeau costing them even
more.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs. Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest-income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boosting the government’s matching RESP contributions by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids education. For some, that could be $540 more.

A new Conservative government will work with provinces and territories to protect waters
Conservative candidate for Richmond-Arthabaska Alain Rayes was joined by Robert Coutu, candidate for La Pointe-de-l’île, and spoke at Parc de l’hôtel de ville about Canada’s Conservative’s plan to protect our waters. A new Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer will work with the provinces and municipalities to put an end to raw sewage being dumped in waterways across Canada. 
“Our waterways should not be used as a toxic dumping ground and it’s
our responsibility to protect these vital natural assets for future generations
to enjoy,” said Rayes. “In one of her first acts as environment minister,
Catherine McKenna gave the go-ahead to the City of Montreal to dump eight
billion litres of raw sewage into one of Canada’s most iconic waterways, the
Saint Lawrence River. It’s disgusting and it’s wrong. We will help put an end
to it.”
Eight billion litres is the equivalent of 3,200 Olympic-sized
swimming pools.
In
2017 alone, municipalities dumped 215 billion litres of raw sewage untreated
into lakes and rivers across the country. 
“Since taking office, Justin Trudeau has failed to protect our waterways
from pollution,” said Rayes. “This is not acceptable. Trudeau is putting the
biodiversity values of our land, waterways, and marine environments at risk.”
When it comes to the environment, Justin
Trudeau makes big promises and then fails to deliver. He claims his government
is on track to reduce
Canada’s emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 but reports by his own
government say he’s not even close. When it comes to protecting our
environment, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. 
Canada’s Conservatives have a proud legacy when it comes to
managing Canada’s natural environment and improving Canada’s environmental
performance. A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment builds on
this proud legacy andwill further
lower Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen environmental
protections, with the core Conservative
promise to put more money in Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead.
FACTS:
Since coming to
power, Justin Trudeau has done nothing to tackle this problem. He continues to
use our waterways as a dumping ground for toxic waste.In 2007, the
previous Conservative government implemented the Lake Simcoe Clean-Up Fund. It
funded over 200 community-based projects that restored fish and wildlife
populations, planted thousands of new trees, and reduced harmful sewage and
waste dumps into watersheds. The Trudeau Liberals cancelled the fund in 2017. The previous Conservative
government had an excellent track record on waste management. We created the
Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations to set higher standards for wastewater
treatment, and made wastewater investments across the country.Canada’s Conservatives
recognize the global environmental impact of climate change. That is why we
have a responsible, fully costed and effective plan to address global
emissions, built on three guiding principles: Green Technology, Not TaxesA Cleaner and Greener Natural Environment Taking the Climate Change Fight Global

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Michelle Rempel, Shadow Minister for Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship, and Pierre Paul-Hus, Shadow Minister for Public Safety, Border Security, and Emergency Preparedness, issued the following statement on reports of a spike in Mexican nationals with ties to drug cartels in Canada following the removal of the visa requirement for Mexicans:
“Today’s reports are alarming and reinforce the fact that the Liberals’ careless decision to lift visas off Mexican nationals travelling to Canada was ill-conceived and not only jeopardizes the integrity of Canada’s immigration system, but presents significant public safety risks to Canadians.
“The Canadian Border Services Agency has also warned that lifting visas would allow Mexican drug cartels to strengthen smuggling chains into Canada but the Liberals ignored their advice.
“The reports today, coupled with the dramatic rise in asylum claims, show that the Conservative Party was right all along – that the visa requirement on Mexico should never have been lifted without a formal review. It is also clear that Justin Trudeau has failed to manage our border in the context of our relationship with the Mexican government.
“Given both of these serious issues, it is incumbent upon the Liberal government to immediately take concrete steps to rectify these issues, so that an incoming government won’t have to take stronger corrective measures in the fall.
“From the beginning, Conservatives have urged Justin Trudeau to follow a standard process and conduct a formal risk assessment before removing the visa for Mexican travelers to Canada. They have, instead, ignored the advice of immigration officials, which has caused a massive spike in asylum claims and eased entry for criminals into the country.
“Successive Canadian governments have consistently applied the same objective criteria in assessing whether to grant visa exemptions. This is to ensure that visa policy is based on Canada’s national interest, and in accordance with the rule of law, rather than on arbitrary political considerations as Justin Trudeau has chosen to do.
“A Conservative government will deal swiftly and firmly with gang crime as part of our overall plan for A Safer Canada, by listing gangs in the Criminal Code and facilitating prosecutions. We will restore fairness, order, and compassion to Canada’s immigration system, and ensure it is not being abused by criminals.”

Trudeau Liberals to send another $2.544 billion dollars in debt interest payments to bankers and foreign creditors
Canadians know that Justin Trudeau is not
as advertised, and now we know that their platform is not as advertised either.

The Trudeau Liberals are failing to
account for changes in public debt charges as a result of their endless
deficits. 
In total, the Trudeau Liberal platform will send an additional $2.544 billion dollars to bankers and foreign creditors to pay for their out-of-control spending. 

The PBO offered all parties costing tools
to determine the changes to public debt charges. Clearly, the Trudeau Liberals
didn’t use these tools or the Trudeau Liberals intentionally left the numbers
out of their fiscal track. 
On top of that, a number of Trudeau Liberal promises remain un-costed by an independent analysis:  
Pharmacare; 
Net-zero emissions by 2050; 
Assigning a family doctor to every Canadian; 
Lowering after-school fees by 10 per cent; 
 High
speed internet across the country
Guaranteed paid family leave; 
With the release of their platform, Justin
Trudeau’s Liberals are doubling down on their endless deficits that threaten
the social services, like health care and education, we all depend on. 
If Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are
re-elected, they will do what they did last time and hike your taxes to pay for
their out-of-control spending. 
Additional information: 
Justin Trudeau’s campaign promises added to his existing deficits will pile on $100 billion of new      debt to the books;His deficit will hit $27.4 billion in 2020; and,Total debt by the end of Justin Trudeau’s second term would be over $800 billion.
What does that mean for you? Justin
Trudeau’s never-ending spending will threaten the quality of our health and
social programs. He will be forced to raise taxes to pay for his endless debt
and deficits.
To pay just half of Justin Trudeau’s
deficits ($14B), he would have to either:
Raise the GST by 2% or;Raise the rate on the first income tax bracket from 15% to 19% or;Raise the rate on the second income tax bracket from 20.5% to 27%

MILTON, ON
– The Honourable Lisa Raitt, Deputy Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and Shadow
Minister for Justice, issued the following statement:
 
“During the height of the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal, Justin Trudeau and
the Liberals made it clear to Canadians just how far they will go to cover up
the truth.  Justin Trudeau tried to interfere in a criminal court case and
when he got caught he shut down multiple investigations and then tried to
distract Canadians by launching a study into the possible separation of the
role of Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
 
“He even appointed former Liberal cabinet Minister Anne McLellan as an
‘independent advisor’ despite the fact that when she was appointed she was
still scheduled to make headline appearances at Liberal Party
fundraisers.  What Justin Trudeau doesn’t understand is that the problem
isn’t with the rules, the problem is when you have people who are trying to
break the rules.  Politicians who try to break rules will always find new
ways of breaking new rules.
 
“McLellan’s report was due by the end of June and even though she wasn’t
mandated to report on the culture of corruption endemic to the Liberal Party,
Justin Trudeau has still not released her recommendations.
 
“Trudeau promised accountability and transparency. He promised to do politics

“One-hundred and five years ago today, the Komagata Maru, a ship carrying nearly four hundred Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims of South Asian origin, was turned away from our shores. Forced to return to India, this event has caused terrible hardship for its passengers, ending tragically for many.
“It was a humbling experience to be a part of the first Government in Canada to officially recognize the Komagata Maru tragedy and apologize for it. It was our previous Conservative government that took a number of steps to address this terrible tragedy and make sure that for generations to come, Canadians will not forget of this dark chapter in our history.
“In addition, we created educational programs, built the first ever public museum dedicated to the tragedy that is now housed at the Khalsa Diwan Society in Vancouver, as well as the first ever public monument in Vancouver’s Harbour Green Park. As a result, in 2014 Canada Post released a special stamp on the hundredth anniversary to further create awareness.
“Today, Canada is home to well over a million Canadians of South Asian descent. Our country has been greatly enriched by the contributions of the Sikh, Hindu and Muslim communities and we are grateful for the tremendous dedication that they have shown in helping build our country.

OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues statement to mark World Refugee Day:
“Today on World Refugee Day we call to mind the plight of refugees and displaced people and celebrate Canada as a beacon of hope and land of refuge.
“Refugees and the displaced overcome countless challenges to flee sometimes horrific persecution and hardship. Leaving their homes and homelands behind, they have to demonstrate extraordinary resilience and bravery to begin their new lives in our free and open country.
“This is an opportunity to reflect on one of the most significant challenges facing humanity. Today, we are witnessing very high numbers of people either internally displaced or seeking refuge or asylum. Persecution, conflict, and instability have forced an unprecedented number of people, mostly children, out of their homes and communities and into the unknown.
“The economic, political, and social challenges that have led to displacement around the world are not lost on Canadians – whether it’s in the Middle East where Yazidis and Christians have been brutally persecuted for their religious beliefs, or in Venezuela where a corrupt and oppressive government has forced its citizens to seek a new home simply to survive, or the Rohingya people who have been denied citizenship in their native Myanmar and forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.
“The generosity of Canadians opening their homes and communities to refugees from around the world is one of the finest examples of the Canadian spirit. Canada has welcomed countless individuals and families who were once forcibly uprooted from their homes, but are now thriving members of Canadian society. Under a Conservative government, with fair, orderly, and compassionate immigration, refugee, and asylum systems, we can do more to help the world’s most vulnerable.
“This World Refugee Day, let us remember the hardships that refugees around the world have endured, and let us celebrate Canada, where so many of those refugees have found freedom, peace and the rule of law.”

New Conservative government to make it easier for volunteers to qualify for tax credits recognizing their service 
A new Conservative government will allow more search and rescue volunteers and volunteer firefighters to qualify for tax savings, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today. 
“Communities across Canada rely on
volunteers for essential services like fire protection and search and rescue,”
Scheer said. “These are people of courage, character, and strength who step up
when their neighbours need it most, often at significant personal expense. A
new Conservative government will recognize this service and sacrifice by making
it easier for them to qualify for tax savings so they can get ahead.”
A new Conservative government will put
more money back in the pockets of these hometown heroes by reducing the number
of service hours required to qualify for federal tax credits from 200 to 150
hours per year.
Volunteers
often pay out-of-pocket for equipment, uniforms, transportation, training, and
insurance – costs that run into the thousands of dollars. 
Volunteers
will continue to receive a $450 rebate every year. The Parliamentary Budget
Officer estimates that lowering the number of required hours by 50 will allow more
than 5,000 additional volunteers to apply for and receive these benefits. 
Scheer
made today’s announcement in New Brunswick, where volunteer search and rescue
teams have been active for more than 35 years. Upper Kingsclear also relies on volunteer
firefighters for its protection, several of whom were on hand for today’s announcement.
 “A new Conservative government will live
within its means and put more money back in your pockets – for you, for your
family, and your retirement,” Scheer said. 
FACTS:
Last
year, the National Fire Protection Association reports that of the 152,650 local firefighters
in Canada from 2014-16, 126,650 (83 per cent) were volunteers. That same report
found that of 3,672 fire departments in Canada, 3,061 are all-volunteer.The
Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada (SARVAC) says 9,000 volunteers serve on 300 search and
rescue teams across the country. All told, these volunteers contribute more
than 600,000 hours of training, administration, and searches each year.The
previous Conservative government introduced the Volunteer Firefighter Tax Credit
in Budget 2011 and the Search and Rescue Volunteer Tax
Credit in Budget 2014.In
2016, nearly 43,000 individuals claimed the Volunteer Firefighter Tax Credit
and 4,800 individuals claimed the Search and Rescue Volunteer Tax Credit.Justin
Trudeau has done nothing with these tax credits and nothing for these
volunteers.

Investment will reduce wait times for potentially life-saving scans 
A new Conservative government will invest $1.5 billion in its
first term to purchase MRI machines and CT machines to replace aging equipment and
add machines across the country, reducing wait times for potentially
life-saving tests for Canadians, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“Hundreds of thousands of Canadians wait longer than the recommended
time for an MRI or a CT scan. That is just not good enough”, said Scheer. “This
investment will help our health care providers to deliver quality services with
the most up-to-date technology, giving patients quicker access to reliable,
potentially life-saving tests.”
Justin Trudeau’s never-ending deficits and out-of-control
spending have put Canada on track to hit $1 trillion in debt by 2035. If
Trudeau is given four more years, his debt and never-ending deficits will
threaten our ability to deliver quality public services like health and social
programs.
A
new Conservative government will live within its means to protect health care
in the long term. As written in a letter to all Premiers in August 2019, as
Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will maintain and increase the current funding
formula for the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer. 
“Canadians need a government that understands that balancing the budget is the best way to maintain the services that they rely on the most, including health care,” Scheer said. “Canada’s Conservatives will give you more help for your health, so you can get ahead.”
FACTS:
Justin Trudeau said he would balance the budget
by 2019. Instead, he has raised taxes, imposed a carbon tax, and his massive overspending
now puts health and social programs at risk.According to a recent report
by the Conference
Board of Canada, Canada’s stock of MRI and CT
machines is aging, supply is not keeping up with demand, and wait times for
these important diagnostic tests exceed the wait-time recommendations from the
Canadian Association of Radiologists. By upgrading and increasing available
medical imaging equipment, Canadians will have better, faster access to quality
tests. Getting earlier access to a test could mean an earlier diagnosis for the
patient. In addition to improving wait
times, this investment will also give provincial governments some additional
spending flexibility, as the federal government would pick up the bill for
replacing out-of-date imaging equipment that the provinces would likely have to
replace. Demand for medical imaging
tests is only expected to increase as our population ages.

$2/litre gasoline is just around the corner
New research from the Conservative Party of
Canada reveals Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax increase will hit Canadians hard,
adding hundreds of dollars to their bottom line.
Trudeau’s environment minister Catherine McKenna just
recently revealed the Trudeau Liberal’s hidden agenda
to increase their Carbon Tax.
Canadians are now wondering just how high it will go – and
what it will mean for their bank accounts.
We did the math.
The carbon tax right now sits at $20/tonne and will have
to go up to $100/tonne after 2022, and as high as  $300/tonne by
2050 for the Liberals to reach their environment targets. The Parliamentary
Budget Officer confirmed the carbon tax would have to be $102/tonne to meet the
targets.
Given Trudeau has confirmed a carbon tax hike is on the
table, the Conservative Party has conducted research to determine just how much
it would cost the average Canadian household.
At the PBO’s $102/tonne level Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would:
Increase the cost of natural gas for an average household by $469 a yearAdd 31 cents/litre to the price of gasoline.
That means $2/litre gasoline is just around the corner if
the Trudeau Liberals are re-elected. At the end of the day, it’s Canadians who
will bear the cost of Justin Trudeau’s taxes as the price of every day
essentials are increased:
In Ontario, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,151.In New Brunswick, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $959.In Manitoba, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,116.In Saskatchewan, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,930.In Alberta, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $2,002.
“Justin Trudeau has proven that he can’t be trusted to
help Canadians get ahead,” said Pierre Poilievre, MP for Carleton. “If he’s
given four more years, his carbon tax will cost Canadians thousands of dollars
more every year. Life is expensive enough for Canadian families without Justin
Trudeau costing them even more.”
Poilievre highlighted Trudeau’s Carbon Tax increase at
Abby Hill Farms, a country market in Ottawa that has been hit hard by the
carbon tax.
Having campaigned in 2015 to offer “real help to Canada’s
middle class and all those working hard to join it,” Trudeau is instead making
life more difficult for the very families he promised to support.
“Only Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have a plan to live within our means and put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead,” Poilievre said.

NOVEMBER 9, 2019
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“Today, Canada joins our friends and allies in marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
“Built by the Communist government of East Germany, the so-called German Democratic Republic, the Berlin Wall physically divided Berlin for 28 years from 1961 to 1989, serving as a physical reminder of where communism ended and freedom began. Built to imprison East Germans and keep them captive to their socialist system, it quickly became one of the most notorious symbols of the “Iron Curtain”, dividing not only East and West Germany, but also eastern and western Europe.
“Approximately 5,000 East Germans managed to escape across the Berlin Wall to freedom, but sadly, another 5,000 were captured by the Stasi and 191 individuals were killed during their attempts to cross the wall.
“Thirty years ago today, thousands of East Germans bravely took to the streets to tear down the wall that symbolized the tyranny of communism and separated many from their family, friends and the free world. A wave of democratization swept through Eastern Europe in 1989, and the widespread discontent with the failures of communism, combined with a deep desire for liberty, drove the fall of the Berlin Wall and the pursuit of political and economic freedom for all Europeans.  
“Today, we also remember the one million members of the Canadian Forces and their families that were stationed in NATO bases across Western Europe, many of them serving at CFB Lahr and CFB Baden-Soellingen. In remembrance of our brave soldiers, the German government presented a piece of the Berlin Wall to Canada, which Prime Minister Stephen Harper placed in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa in 2009 for permanent display. Let us never forget the Canadian and Allied heroes who served in the Cold War, defending democracy and fundamental human rights.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I encourage all Canadians to learn about and remember the history of the Berlin Wall, the Cold War, and Canada’s valiant role in the Allied victory.”

Conservative plan takes real action to fight crime vs. Trudeau’s do-nothing gun ban
A new Conservative government will take real
action to fight gang and gun violence, combat human trafficking, and tackle
drug addictions and recovery, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced
today.
“As Prime Minister, I will lead a government that
honours its most sacred duty – to keep its citizens and their streets safe,”
Scheer said. “Justin Trudeau has failed in this regard and all of his proposed
measures to fight crime simply will not work. Canadians can’t trust him to keep
them safe.”  
The Conservative plan for safer streets targets
illegal firearms crossing the border and ending up with gangsters, while
strengthening penalties to keep gang and gun criminals behind bars.  
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer’s plan for A
Safer Canada will: 
End automatic bail
for gang members awaiting trial and revoke parole for any gang member who
associates with their former gang following release.
Identify known
gangs as criminal entities in the Criminal Code, similar to how terrorist
organizations are currently listed.
Bring in tougher
sentences, including a five-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for violent
gang crime, with a new five-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for
possession of a smuggled firearm. 
Create a Canada
Border Services Agency firearms smuggling task force to intercept illegal
firearms at the Canada-US border.
Strengthen
background checks for gun licenses and make it a crime to provide a firearm to
anyone who has been prohibited from owning them. 
Revise the
Canadian drugs and substance strategy to focus on helping Canadians recover
from addiction.
Strengthen human trafficking laws, including consecutive sentences for
those who are convicted on multiple counts of human trafficking and ensuring
Canada meets our commitments under the Palermo Protocol. 
Scheer contrasted the detailed Conservative plan
with Trudeau’s vague firearms ban that will do nothing to crack down on gun
crime.
“Forcing law-abiding Canadians to follow even
more laws will not reduce crime,” Scheer said. “Criminals don’t follow laws and
that’s exactly why we have to target them. My plan does the hard work of
tracking down criminals and putting them behind bars where they belong so you
and your family can be safe and get ahead.”
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs. Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50%, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of families who make green-home improvements.

A new Conservative government would take measures to safeguard against abuse of power
In Justin Trudeau’s
riding of Papineau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today that a
new Conservative government would launch a judicial inquiry into the
SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.
A new Conservative government will also introduce the No More Cover-Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access information protected by cabinet confidence by making an application to the Supreme Court of Canada. This will prevent corrupt politicians from hiding behind cabinet confidence to escape police investigation. 
As confirmed by
hours of Parliamentary testimony, taped conversations, and an Ethics
Commissioner’s guilty verdict, Trudeau politically interfered in SNC-Lavalin’s
criminal prosecution by trying to “circumvent, undermine, and ultimately attempt
to discredit” former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould.
However, to
this day, Trudeau refuses to waive cabinet confidence, keeping important
details of the scandal secret and preventing several key witnesses, including
Ms. Wilson-Raybould, from disclosing evidence.
“Justin Trudeau
has covered up his role in the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal every step of the
way,” Scheer said. “He blocked three Parliamentary investigations, refused to
co-operate with the Ethics Commissioner, and is currently blocking the RCMP
from obtaining key evidence. As Prime Minister, I will call a judicial inquiry
so Canadians can finally get the answers they deserve.”
“No longer will
a corrupt Prime Minister be able to be the gatekeeper of his own misconduct,”
said Scheer. “These measures will safeguard our democracy against the whims of
sleazy and unscrupulous politicians. Justin Trudeau has so far avoided
consequence for the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal, but the Canadian people
will deliver their verdict on October 21.” 
FACTS: 
In
2017, Justin Trudeau became the first Prime Minister in Canadian history to be
found guilty of breaking ethics laws for accepting a vacation from a lobbyist.
In August, he was found guilty again for his role in the SNC-Lavalin corruption
scandal.Trudeau
abused the power of his office to shut down two separate Ethics Committee
investigations and a Justice Committee investigation.In
his final report, Trudeau II, Ethics
Commissioner Mario Dion noted, “During this examination, nine witnesses
informed our Office that they had information they believed to be relevant, but
that could not be disclosed because, according to them, this information would
reveal a confidence of the Queen’s Privy Council and would fall outside the
scope of Order in Council 2019-0105.”Right
before the election, Canadians learned the RCMP is being prevented from
investigating possible obstruction of justice because Trudeau refuses to waive
cabinet confidence.

New Conservative government to repeal Trudeau tax increases and reduce red tape
Small
business owners can look forward to a new Conservative government repealing
Justin Trudeau’s tax increases and cutting red tape, announced Andrew Scheer at
Cracker Jack’s Bar and Grill today. 
“Justin
Trudeau thinks small businesses are tax cheats, “said Scheer. “In the last four
years, it has become more expensive than ever to run a business. Trudeau’s
Carbon Tax raised the price of gasoline and heating, making it harder to pay
monthly bills. His payroll tax hikes hurt the bottom line, and his
unprecedented tax hike on small businesses in 2017 – although Canada’s
Conservatives and business leaders came together to try to stop it – ended up
costing small businesses even more.” 
The government
should not stand in the way and make life more difficult for those trying to
make a living and grow their business. 
Not
only are small businesses victim to the Trudeau government’s tax hikes, small
businesses across the country are also struggling under a massive regulatory
burden. Justin Trudeau has imposed more than 4,300 job-killing, growth-choking
federal regulations on Canadian business since 2015. 
A
new Conservative government will take several measures to support our small
businesses: 
Repeal
Trudeau’s tax increases on small business investments Exempt
spouses from Trudeau’s tax increases on small business dividends Make
it easier to navigate Canada’s tax system and the Canada Revenue AgencyReduce
federal regulations by 25 per centImplement
a 2-for-1 rule for new regulations Assign
a Minister reporting directly to the Prime Minister to lead red tape reduction
effortsMandate
ministers and regulators to support innovation, economic growth, and global
competitiveness Champion
Canada’s small businesses to the world  
“A
new Conservative government will continue to celebrate small businesses as
drivers of prosperity, and not view them merely as sources of revenue,” said
Scheer. “It’s time to stop Justin Trudeau’s attacks on small business owners.
It is time for Canada’s small businesses to get ahead.”
FACTS:
Of
the 95,000 businesses that are created in Canada each year, barely 50 per cent
will survive to celebrate their tenth anniversary. Over the last four years, it
has become more difficult than ever to start and grow a business.In
2017, Trudeau proposed a disastrous set of small business tax increases that
were only partially abandoned because of effective pressure by Canada’s
Conservatives and massive public outcry.Trudeau
tried to hike taxes on small businesses’ investment income to 73 per cent, and
then went after small business owners’ spouses, ending a long-standing tax
exemption on dividend payments. The
Canadian Chamber of Commerce (CCC) reports there were 131,754 federal regulations
on the books when Justin Trudeau took office in 2015. Public policy think-tank
MEI reports that by 2018, the number of federal
regulations rose to 136,121 – an increase of more than 4,300.In
late 2018, the Financial Post reported that regulatory burden was
“killing Canada’s competitiveness.”

Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost      of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an      average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your      family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit,      saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Regina, SK – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition issued the following statement on Justin Trudeau’s failure to get an exemption from the latest Buy American rules:
 “Justin Trudeau failed Canadians by surrendering so much and getting pushed-around by President Trump during the NAFTA re-negotiations, and now we are seeing it happen once again with the United States’ Executive Order on Buy America.
 “When Justin Trudeau had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to negotiate a better deal for Canadians, he gave up concession after concession to Donald Trump without securing anything in return. Canada’s hard-working steel and manufacturing workers are now paying the price.
 “Just last week, Canada’s Premiers came together to call-on the Trudeau government to secure Canadian exemptions from Buy America policies. We have already seen the damage these Buy America policies can cause, and even though the Premiers raised their concerns, things have gotten worse.
 “Justin Trudeau promised that Canada would be respected on the world-stage, but clearly he is Not as Advertised. It’s obvious that our trading partners see Justin Trudeau as a weak leader who will be pushed-around every step of the way on the world stage.
 “A Conservative Government will always fight for Canadian workers, and unlike Justin Trudeau and the Liberals, we will stand firm in defence of Canadian interests.”

A new Conservative government would engage new strategies, partnerships
and provide funding to support critical industry
Alfie MacLeod, Conservative Candidate for Cape Breton
– Canso, and Eddie Orrell, Conservative Candidate for Sydney – Victoria, were
in Glace Bay today to speak with local fish harvesters about Andrew Scheer’s
plan to promote and support Canada’s fisheries by adopting new strategies and
partnerships to strengthen relationships and build consensus on how to restore
fish stocks. Similar announcements were made by Conservative candidates across
the country.
“The Trudeau Liberals have failed to consult fish
harvesters over the past four years and this has had a real impact on our
coastal communities,” said Alfie MacLeod. “Livelihoods throughout our
province depend on the fishery. 
Conservatives will work with Nova Scotians to strengthen this vital
resource.”
To renew engagement and consultation to support our
fisheries, a new Conservative government will:
Create advisory panels with fish harvesters and anglers, Indigenous groups, and other experts
as appropriate, to rebuild critical stocks and ensure that everyone is working
together. Enhance and rebuild wild Atlantic and Pacific salmon stocks by increasing support for community-led conservation and enhancement
projects and increasing the price of the Salmon Conservation Stamp for
non-residents to benefit the Pacific Salmon Foundation.Complete new recovery
plans for all of Canada’s critical fisheries and develop strategies for managing
predators and invasive species where necessary.Repeal measures that
bypass community consultations for Marine Protected Areas while ensuring that the process is robust and timely. Justin Trudeau’s changes have short
circuited important community consultations for Marine Protected Areas. Work with industry to
develop a strategy for preventing seafood fraud.Create a modern
aquaculture act.Support the advancement
of technology and practices that reduce contact between wild and farmed salmon.
“It is so important to note the important role that
fisheries play in our local economies,” said Alfie MacLeod. “To maintain
infrastructure and support communities, a new Conservative government will provide $250 million in additional support for small craft harbours.”
Supporting our fisheries is also an important part of A
Real Plan to Protect Our Environment. As part of our
efforts to combat oceans plastic, a new Conservative government will work with
international partners to reduce the prevalence of “ghost gear”, or abandoned
and lost gear, which entangles marine wildlife and contributes to the world’s
oceans’ plastic problem. We will work to protect our oceans against one of the
deadliest forms of marine litter.
“A new Conservative government will support our fishing
industry to ensure our local communities and economies continue to thrive,”
said Eddie Orrell. “These are necessary measures – strategies, partnerships,
and funding – to make sure this critical industry continues to thrive.”
Andrew
Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives: “Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.

A new Conservative government will fund projects that get Canadians home faster, reduce commute times
A new Conservative government will fund the Ontario Line and Yonge
Subway Extension projects as part of a plan to prioritize projects that get
Canadians home faster, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension are two great
examples of projects that reduce commute times and relieve traffic congestion
for hard-working commuters,” Scheer said.
“These are exactly the kinds of infrastructure projects a new
Conservative government will prioritize and I’m pleased to announce that as
Prime Minister, my government will fund them.” 
The 7.4-kilometre Yonge Subway
Extension will connect Toronto to Markham, Vaughan and Richmond Hill – one of
the fastest growing regions in Ontario. The 15-kilometre Ontario Line will
increase capacity by 30 per cent on a critically needed east-west and
north-south route. 
Scheer was joined by Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti and Richmond
Hill Mayor David Barrow and pointed out that despite a $187 billion infrastructure
spending commitment, Justin Trudeau has failed to deliver much-needed commuter
infrastructure for Canadians.
“Justin Trudeau was elected on a promise to invest in
infrastructure and get these kinds of projects built. But four years later, he
has spent the money but has nothing to show for it. We got the deficits without
the infrastructure,” Scheer said. “Once again, he is not as advertised.”
Only Canada’s Conservatives have a plan to lower your taxes and
put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead. We will build the
desperately needed infrastructure Canadians need to get home faster at the end
of the day.
FACTS:
Commute times in Toronto are
up an
average of almost 8 per cent since 2013, with
an average commute of 42 minutes.The Ontario Line is estimated
to cost $10.9 billion and is scheduled to be complete by 2027.The Yonge Subway Extension is
estimated to cost $5.6 billion and should be operational right after the
Ontario Line opens. A new Conservative government
would fund projects that reduce commute times across the country like the George
Massey Tunnel replacement project in Vancouver and the third link across the
Saint Lawrence River in Québec City.According to the Parliamentary
Budget Officer (PBO), for every dollar
Justin Trudeau promised for infrastructure, he only spent 60 cents: “the
Government failed to spend about 40 per cent of its planned infrastructure
budget.” Analysis
showed that for all his spending, there are no substantial results to show for
it.In its analysis of Budget 2018,
the PBO reported:
“Budget 2018 provides an incomplete account of the changes to the Government’s
$186.7 billion infrastructure spending plan. PBO requested the new plan but it
does not exist.”If given four more years,
Justin Trudeau’s debt and never-ending deficits will delay badly needed
infrastructure, threatening the future of important projects like the Ontario
Line and Yonge Subway Extension, and doing nothing to reduce commute times.Trudeau’s Carbon tax will add
31 cents a litre to the price of gas, adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of
everyday essentials. In Ontario, his carbon tax will cost you over a thousand
dollars each and every year.

A new Conservative government will put more money in your pocket for you and your family.
When Canadians go to the polls on Oct. 21,
only the Conservative Party of Canada will have a trustworthy plan to put more
money in your pockets so you can get ahead.
Today, Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives,
officially launched the Conservative Party’s election campaign with a clear
plan to help all Canadians whose lives have gotten more expensive under Justin
Trudeau and the Liberals.
“Canadians are working harder and harder, but they’re just
barely getting by and just can’t seem to get ahead. I’m running to be Prime
Minister with a clear plan to make life more affordable for you and your
family,” said Scheer.
Scheer highlighted that after four years, Justin Trudeau’s
huge deficits, mounting debt, tax hikes, and broken promises have left Canadian
families worse off. Under Trudeau, 80% of middle-income families have seen
their federal taxes increase by $800 or more per year.
“Justin Trudeau was elected on a promise to help the
middle class. But the last four years have shown he is just not as advertised,”
said Scheer. “Instead of ‘sunny ways’ and ‘real change,’ you got four years of
higher gas prices, massive deficits, mounting debt, and a carbon tax that makes
everyday essentials more expensive.”
Scheer added, “Four more years of Justin Trudeau is four
more years of deficits that threaten our health care and education systems, a
higher carbon tax on gas, groceries and home heating, and four more years of
weakness on the world stage, scandals, and cover ups.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Take the GST off home heating costsScrap the Trudeau Carbon TaxMake maternity benefits tax-freeCreate better, higher paying jobs by embracing nation building projects at home, while standing up for Canadian workers on the world stage.
“I’m a kid that grew up in a townhouse, in a family that
didn’t own a car, whose mother lived with her eight siblings in a two-bedroom
house on a dirt road, and today I am running to be Prime Minister. That’s the
kind of opportunity Canada offered me. I want Canada to be that place for
everyone,” Scheer said.

A new Conservative government will prioritize critical
infrastructure projects that shorten commute times like the George Massey
Tunnel replacement in the Greater Vancouver Area, Conservative Leader Andrew
Scheer announced today.
“Canadians are sick and tired of being stuck in traffic and
waiting for delayed public transit,” said Scheer. “Canada’s Conservatives will

times for everyone, whether you drive or catch public transit.”
Examples of the type of projects that would be prioritized for
funding include:
The George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project (British Columbia)The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension (Ontario)The third link between Quebec City and Levis (Québec)
Scheer pointed out how, despite making a $187-billion
infrastructure spending commitment in the 2015 election, Justin Trudeau has
failed to deliver important projects for Canadian commuters.
“He’s made billions in promises but hasn’t delivered. When it
comes to getting shovels in the ground and getting projects built, Justin

infrastructure spending by scrapping Justin Trudeau’s $35-billion Infrastructure
Bank which has been nothing but a waste of taxpayer dollars, adding countless

infrastructure projects that have already been committed to will move forward. Going
forward, a new Conservative government will have a strategy in place to prioritize
future transportation projects on whether they lower commute times and also provide
more housing options for Canadians.”
FACTS:
Statistics Canada found that 1.5
million Canadians spent at least an hour commuting to work in 2016.According to the Parliamentary
Budget Officer (PBO), for every dollar
Justin Trudeau promised for infrastructure, he only spent 60 cents: “the
Government failed to spend about 40 per cent of its planned infrastructure
budget.” Analysis
showed that for all his spending, there are no substantial results to show for
it.In its analysis of Budget 2018,
the PBO reported:
“Budget 2018 provides an incomplete account of the changes to the Government’s
$186.7 billion infrastructure spending plan. PBO requested the new plan but it
does not exist.”If given four more years,
Justin Trudeau’s debt and never-ending deficits will delay badly needed
infrastructure, threatening the future of important projects like the George
Massey Tunnel replacement. 
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up      to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESP’s by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians for green home improvements.

Liberals not as advertised on Canada’s Veterans
The Conservative Party today released a manifesto by
Liberal MP and candidate for Don Valley West, Rob Oliphant, in which he bemoans
Remembrance Day as something “used to
promote the remilitarization of Canada,” and “continue towards becoming a
national war-machine.”
Oliphant explains how “conflicted” he is about Remembrance Day and
his belief that it tends to “glorify war.” 
If it isn’t shame for Remembrance Day like that which Mr. Oliphant
has, it’s lying to Veterans and telling them they’re asking for more than the
Liberals can give, like Justin Trudeau infamously told one Veteran. 
Liberals clearly have a problem with the men and women that have
served in Canada’s military, and a problem showing them the respect they
deserve.
Unlike the Trudeau Liberals, the Andrew Scheer Conservatives know
our Veterans are heroes. They dedicated their lives to protecting us.  Now it is our responsibility to respect their
service by doing our part to look out for them.
Under the Liberals, the number of Veterans stranded on a waitlist
for financial support had ballooned to over 40,000 people – an increase of
11,000 over the previous year.
Only Andrew Scheer and Canada’s Conservatives treat Veterans with
respect and deliver the supports they need in a timely manner, all enshrined in
law through a just announced legislated Military Covenant, found here https://www.conservative.ca/andrew-scheer-promises-more-support-for-canadas-veterans/
Justin Trudeau and Rob Oliphant should feel absolutely ashamed of not just their own record on Veterans and Veterans support, but now their anti-Remembrance Day position.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Lac-Mégantic, QC – Luc Berthold, Conservative Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Agri-Food, released the following statement outlining expectations of the Trudeau government ahead of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Federal-Provincial-Territorial Agriculture Ministers in Quebec City:
 “Justin Trudeau’s Minister of Agriculture Marie-Claude Bibeau promised Canadian milk, egg and poultry farmers that a compensation plan would be in place by June 30th, but the Liberals have blown past their own deadline and failed to deliver any of the $3.9 billion farmers are counting on. Sadly, this comes as no surprise since the Liberals have been failing our agriculture sector for the last four years – raising taxes, making concessions to Donald Trump during NAFTA negotiations, failing to stand up for Canada when China banned meat, soy and canola seed exports, and leaving our farmers with greater uncertainty.
 “With the election three months away, the Trudeau government would rather play politics and delay compensation for their re-election campaign than deliver on their promises. Justin Trudeau must finally release the compensation details promised to Canadian farmers so they can finally receive the support they need. Our farmers can’t afford to wait any longer and they need certainty now.
 “Given Minister Bibeau has the second highest number of dairy farmers in her riding in the country, she should understand how her government’s failures are hurting Canadian farmers. Anything less than a fully-detailed compensation plan is unacceptable.
 “A Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer will always stand up for milk, egg and poultry farmers and ensure they receive the support they deserve.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues the following statement on the Anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising:
“Today
marks the 75th Anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, which began on August 1, 1944
and lasted 63 days. The uprising by the Polish underground resistance, led by
the Polish Home Army, was a brave effort to liberate Poland’s capital from
German occupation. Though the uprising was ultimately defeated, for those
63 days, Canada’s Polish friends and allies fought the German Army, inflicting
numerous losses of troops and resources. 
“Today we
pay tribute to the people of Warsaw, both the combatants and the civilian
population, who demonstrated an inexhaustible willingness to sacrifice all to
preserve their freedom, independence, and the right to a sovereign future.
“On behalf
of Canada’s Conservatives, I encourage all Canadians to learn more about the
history of World War II and the sacrifices made by the ‘greatest generation’ in
defeating tyranny.”

A new Conservative government would put $4,000 in new parents’ pockets  
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives, spoke to new parents about his plan to help Canadians get ahead
by making maternity benefits tax-free.
“It’s young people – starting their careers and starting
their families – who pay the most tax and are hit hardest by government tax
increases,” Scheer said. “I hear that you have jobs, you’re working hard, but
you’re just getting by, and you’re definitely not getting ahead.”
“Only Conservatives can be trusted to make life easier and
more affordable for you and for your family,” said Scheer. “Making maternity
benefits tax-free will put $4,000 back in your pocket so you can focus on your
newborn and not worry too much about your bottom line or bank balance.”
Right now, in Canada, more than 80 per cent of
middle-income families are paying $800 more in taxes a year than they did in
2015. In 2018, the Trudeau Liberals and the NDP cost Canadian families hundreds
of millions of dollars by refusing to support a Conservative bill to support
young families.
“Conservatives believe parents are best placed to make the
decisions that are right for them and their family,” said Scheer. “Only
Canada’s Conservatives can be trusted to leave more money in your pocket so you
and your family can get ahead. It’s time for you to get ahead.”
FACTS:
In 2018, the Liberals and the NDP cost Canadian parents hundreds of millions of dollars in savings when they voted against a Conservative bill, introduced by Andrew Scheer, that would have brought immediate tax relief to families.Families of all income levels and anyone that pays into employment insurance will be eligible for this new benefit.A new Conservative government will provide a tax credit of an equivalent amount for residents of Quebec who receive benefits under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP).

Yesterday, the NDP let the cat out of the

Canadians don’t elect a Conservative majority government on Oct. 21.
When asked about it today, Trudeau did not rule out a

Trudeau as Prime Minister.
With Trudeau forced to rely on the NDP to hang on to
power, what will that mean for you?
An even higher carbon tax. Trudeau is already planning to hike
     the carbon tax if he’s re-elected. But to keep the NDP happy, he’ll have
     to hike it even higher.
      Fewer jobs. NDP economic policies fail
     everywhere they’ve been tried. With the NDP calling the shots, Trudeau

      Even bigger deficits. To meet the NDP’s demands, Trudeau
     will have to spend billions more than he was already planning to, racking
     up huge deficits that will threaten social programs like health care.
Justin Trudeau will pay any price to stay in power. And
it’s your money he will pay with.
There’s only one way for Canadians to stop this coalition

In the face of scandal, Trudeau reveals platform, making billions in farcical promises to Canadians  
In
an attempt to cover up international embarrassment, Justin Trudeau has revealed
his platform, announcing a staggering $57 billion in campaign promises. The
tally of his disastrous campaign is mounting, and so is his debt. 
“Justin
Trudeau will do or say anything to get re-elected. If given four more years, we
know that Trudeau is going to raise your taxes to pay for his out of control
spending,” said Pierre Poilievre, MP Carleton at a media availability in
Ottawa.
To
reveal the true cost of Justin Trudeau’s poor judgement, the Conservative Party
has once again done the math:
Justin
Trudeau’s campaign promises added to his existing deficits will pile on $100
billion of new debt to the books; His
deficit will hit $27.4 billion in 2020; and, Total
debt by the end of Justin Trudeau’s second term would be over $800 billion.  
What
does that mean for you? Justin Trudeau’s never-ending spending will threaten
the quality of our health and social programs. He will be forced to raise taxes
to pay for his endless debt and deficits. 
To
pay just half of Justin Trudeau’s deficits ($14B), he would have to either:
Raise
the GST by 2% or; Raise
the rate on the first income tax bracket from 15% to 19% or;Raise
the rate on the second income tax bracket from 20.5% to 27% or; Lower
the basic personal amount from $12,069 to $6,869. 
Further,
by reaching $823 billion in total debt, Trudeau is will spend $35 billion on
interest payments alone. That’s $35 billion that will not go to Canadians’
priorities.
Justin
Trudeau campaigned on a promise to help the middle class. Instead, he raised
taxes on 80 per cent of middle-class Canadians and imposed a carbon tax that
makes everyday essential more expensive. If Justin Trudeau is re-elected, his
carbon tax is going to increase the price of gasoline by 31 cents per litre. 
“This
election will come down to the choice between a government who thinks they can
spend your money better than you, raises taxes, and makes your life more
unaffordable – and a new Conservative government that will lower your taxes and
put more money in your pocket,” said Poilievre. 
JUSTIN
TRUDEAU’S BROKEN PROMISES: 
Balanced
Budgets: 
“I
am looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way I always have. We’ve
said we are committed to balanced budgets and we are. We will balance that
budget in 2019.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
It’s
2019, and as we can see the budget did not “balance itself.” Justin Trudeau is
running endless deficits that threaten the social services Canadians depend on
and if re-elected Trudeau will just raise your taxes to pay for his out of
control spending. 
Electoral
Reform: 
“As
Prime Minister, I’ll make sure the 2015 election will be the last under
first-past-the-post system.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
There’s
another election, and guess what? It’s being held under first-past-the-post. 
Veterans:

“Our
plan will give back to those who have given so much in service to all
Canadians, and will ensure that no veteran has to fight the government for the
support and compensation they have earned.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015
Election Platform
Justin
Trudeau looked a military hero in the eye – a man who lost his leg fighting for
our country – and said that veterans are “asking for more than we are able to
give.” 
Accountability:

“We
will restore trust in our democracy.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election
Platform
Justin
Trudeau was the first Prime Minister in our country’s history to be found
guilty of breaking ethics laws, and he did it not once but twice! 
Justin
Trudeau has stonewalled the Ethics Commissioner, shut-down parliamentary
committees search for answers into Liberal corruption scandals, and he is now
doing everything in his power to block the RCMP from investigating his office.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues statement to mark World Refugee Day:
“Today on World Refugee Day we call to mind the plight of refugees and displaced people and celebrate Canada as a beacon of hope and land of refuge.
“Refugees and the displaced overcome countless challenges to flee sometimes horrific persecution and hardship. Leaving their homes and homelands behind, they have to demonstrate extraordinary resilience and bravery to begin their new lives in our free and open country.
“This is an opportunity to reflect on one of the most significant challenges facing humanity. Today, we are witnessing very high numbers of people either internally displaced or seeking refuge or asylum. Persecution, conflict, and instability have forced an unprecedented number of people, mostly children, out of their homes and communities and into the unknown.
“The economic, political, and social challenges that have led to displacement around the world are not lost on Canadians – whether it’s in the Middle East where Yazidis and Christians have been brutally persecuted for their religious beliefs, or in Venezuela where a corrupt and oppressive government has forced its citizens to seek a new home simply to survive, or the Rohingya people who have been denied citizenship in their native Myanmar and forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.
“The generosity of Canadians opening their homes and communities to refugees from around the world is one of the finest examples of the Canadian spirit. Canada has welcomed countless individuals and families who were once forcibly uprooted from their homes, but are now thriving members of Canadian society. Under a Conservative government, with fair, orderly, and compassionate immigration, refugee, and asylum systems, we can do more to help the world’s most vulnerable.
“This World Refugee Day, let us remember the hardships that refugees around the world have endured, and let us celebrate Canada, where so many of those refugees have found freedom, peace and the rule of law.”

approve the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion:
 
“Today’s cabinet approval of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion will come as
no surprise. This will, in fact, be the third time the Liberals approve this
project. Approving it for a third time is meaningless.
 
“The question is when will it get built. The Liberals still have absolutely no
plan for construction.
 
“After approving it for the first time in 2016, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals
failed to demonstrate the leadership and political will to get it built.
 
“So, with the project in jeopardy, the government purchased it with $4.5
billion in taxpayer dollars. This sent a message to the world that the only way
to get a big project built in Canada is to have the government nationalize it.
 
“Despite these approvals, not a single inch of new pipeline has been laid and
not a single ounce of dirt has been moved. These delays have cost Canadians
billions in economic activity.
 
“Today’s cabinet decision gets us no closer to having this vital, job-creating
protect than we were when it was first approved two and a half years ago.
 
“Justin Trudeau has said he wants to “phase out” Canada’s oil and gas sector.
For once, all is going according to his plan.
 
“Fortunately, Canada’s Conservatives have a plan to get pipelines built.
 
“We will cancel the Trudeau carbon tax, repeal the No-More-Pipelines Bill C-69
and Oil-Export-Ban Bill C-48, establish clear timelines for approvals,
eliminate foreign interference in the approvals process, and invoke federal
jurisdiction when necessary.”

It’s not surprising that Trudeau is running from his
record of disastrous foreign policy decisions, embarrassing behaviour, and
refusal to stand up for Canada’s interests against hostile foreign powers. 
When Justin Trudeau was first elected in 2015 he
proclaimed that Canada was back. Instead, he has diminished Canada’s role on
the world stage by:
Pulling our troops out of the fight against ISIS and
initially refusing to acknowledge the genocide being committed by the Islamic
State;Damaging relations with Canada’s allies like Japan and
Australia;Embarrassing Canadians by bringing a known terrorist

four years failing Canada’s agriculture sector.
 
“This trend of failure by the Trudeau Liberals should alarm Canada’s
supply-managed farmers and Canada’s agriculture sector. Not only has Canada
lost market access to China for meat, soy and canola seed, but Minister Bibeau
has failed to present a real plan for Canada’s supply-managed farmers. It is
clear than Justin Trudeau’s support for Canada’s milk, egg, and poultry farmers
is not as advertised.
 
“Canada’s milk, egg, and poultry farmers deserve a transparent compensation plan
from the Trudeau Liberals, not a re-election plan.
 
“A Conservative government, led by Prime Minister Andrew Scheer, will continue
to stand up for milk, egg, and poultry farmers and ensure farm families get the
respect they deserve.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issued the following statement on Global Coptic Day:
“Today, Coptic Christians in Canada and across the world will gather with friends and family to celebrate the first Global Coptic Day. Coptic Christians have successfully preserved their rich faith and tradition throughout the centuries, despite facing much oppression and mistreatment.
“Today is also the feast day marking the Entry of Jesus Christ into Egypt, during the Holy Family’s flight from the persecution of King Herod. Proudly maintaining their identity as the descendants of the original people of Egypt who converted to Christianity, the Coptic community to this day cherishes the memory of the Egyptian exile of Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
“The Coptic community have themselves known persecution and martyrdom, the ultimate witness to their faithfulness to Jesus. Even in recent years there have been multiple instances of horrific attacks against Copts, who were targeted simply because they are Christian. This is completely unacceptable.
“Canada is blessed to be a land of freedom. Canada’s Conservatives will always support religious freedom and stand up for the fundamental right of everyone to practice their religion.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to all Coptic Canadians celebrating Global Coptic Day!”

Conservatives plan to increase health care transfers to the provinces by at least 3% per year
When it comes to improving Canada’s health
care system, Canadians can only trust a Conservative Government led by Prime
Minister Andrew Scheer. Justin Trudeau is simply not as advertised.
Under a Conservative government, funding for health care
will increase by at least 3% every single year, and we will maintain additional
Shared Health Priorities funding for mental health and home care for provinces.
We will make major investments in new medical equipment
and introduce a National Autism Strategy. Andrew Scheer is also committed to
working with provinces to ensure that Canadians with rare diseases have access
to the treatments that they need.
Unfortunately Canadians cannot trust Justin Trudeau. The
media have already reported that Justin Trudeau’s health care promises won’t fill the
gaps in Canada’s health care system. What’s worse Trudeau’s reckless
deficits will force him to cut health care spending. In fact, in the 1990s,
Liberals cut health care
spending by nearly 40%, cuts Trudeau said he
supported.
Given that Trudeau has historically supported deep health
care cuts, it’s no surprise that he cut health care
for our brave military heroes.
Unlike Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer has a real plan, a
plan that helps you get ahead.

MPs Erin O’Toole, Ziad Aboultaif and Leona Alleslev sent a letter to the Clerk

Conservatives intend to call the following witnesses: Minister of Foreign
Affairs Chrystia Freeland, Paul Thoppil, Assistant Deputy Minister for
Asia-Pacific, Global Affairs Canada, Mr. Mulroney and Mr. Saint-Jacques.
 
“These exchanges are highly inappropriate and represent a blatant attempt by
Justin Trudeau to muzzle respected former career diplomats. Justin Trudeau has
shown a clear pattern of silencing those who speak out,” said the Hon. Erin
O’Toole, Conservative Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. “As Mr. Mulroney
stated, discouraging private citizens with expertise in foreign relations from
speaking freely is ‘fundamentally an undemocratic idea’. Justin Trudeau must
answer for the many times he has exploited Canada’s non-partisan, public
service for his own political purpose.”

Regina, Saskatchewan – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, issued the following statement regarding today’s Third Link announcement:
“The announcement of the construction of a Third Link between Quebec City and Lévis is great news for the Greater Quebec City area and the eastern part of the province. I have supported this project since the leadership race in 2017. It has always been a priority for me and for Conservative MPs in Quebec.
“Unfortunately, the nomination of Steven Guilbeault, as the Liberal candidate in the Montreal riding of Laurier—Sainte-Marie, sends a clear signal that Justin Trudeau does not support the project and will try to block it if he is re-elected. Liberal MPs Joël Lightbound and Jean-Yves Duclos have never shown any leadership on this file.
“Steven Guilbeault has always been opposed to the Third Link project. As he said to Radio-Canada on October 13, 2018, “The Third Link will not work. It’s a political pitch to pander to voters in Quebec City’s southern suburbs. This project does not make sense.”
“Only a Conservative government, under my leadership in 2019, will work with the Quebec government and be an ally and proponent of the Third Link. Mobility issues are important in the Greater Quebec City area and we sincerely believe that the Third Link will be an important part of addressing this situation.”-30-

Liberals continue to attack whistleblowers and bully

Ottawa, Ontario – The media are reporting that a whistleblower was let go by a Trudeau cabinet minister after the whistleblower tried to flag concerns about a conflict of interest. According to the media, the Liberal Government appointed Moreen Miller as the new Chair of the of Defence Construction Canada (DCC). The only problem is that Ms. Miller continued her role as President of Fowler, a firm that bids on DCC contracts.  Only now, after once again being exposed, the Government was forced to order an ‘urgent’ investigation into the file. This, on the eve of an election.  This is a pattern. First Vice-Admiral Mark Norman was thrown under the bus for raising concerns about the Trudeau government’s unethical behaviour. Then Jody-Wilson Raybould was fired for raising concerns about the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.  Now a third whistleblower has been let go for flagging a conflict of interest.  It’s obvious that there are one set of rules for Trudeau and his friends, and another set of rules for the rest of us.  Justin Trudeau cannot be trusted and if he is re-elected he will continue to break laws and grant insider access to Liberals and corporate lobbyists.  Under Prime Minister Andrew Scheer the corruption in Ottawa will end. It starts with a judicial inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal and introducing the No More Cover Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access information protected by cabinet confidence.

A new Conservative government will expand RESP so parents can get more for their kid’s education 
A new
Conservative government will boost the Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP),
putting more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadian parents trying to
save for their children’s education, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today.
Under the Conservative plan,
the government’s contribution to an RESP will rise from 20 per cent
to 30 per cent for every dollar invested up to $2,500 a year. This change
will boost the maximum annual grant from $500 to $750. 
“For most parents, sending their kids to college,
university, or trade school is the culmination of years of scrimping and
saving,” Scheer said. “By boosting the RESP, a new Conservative government will
put more money in the pockets of parents working hard to help their children
get ahead.”
Under the Conservative plan:
A couple who begins contributing $25 a month to an RESP right
after their child’s birth will receive $1,620 by age 18. That’s $540 more
than they would receive currently. 
Another couple that is able to invest $50 a month will receive $3,240
in government contributions by age 18. That’s $1,080 more than they
would receive currently. 
Low-income parents will receive 50 per cent
on the first $500 they invest every year. Today, they only receive 40 per
cent. 
“RESPs are the most effective way parents can save
for their children’s education and more and more working families are investing
in RESPs every year,” added Scheer. “A new Conservative government
will help you and your family get ahead. We will make sure that Canadians can
give their kids a smart start.”

Increase the Age Credit to help our seniors get ahead 
Today, Andrew Scheer, the Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, announced
that a new Conservative government will increase the Age Credit by $1,000. This
measure is part of the Conservative plan to put more money in the pockets of
all Canadians to help them get ahead.
“The increase will benefit seniors with low or medium incomes most,” said
Scheer. “Many seniors live on a fixed income and they are at the mercy of
governments like Justin Trudeau’s, which has increased the cost of living and
the price of everyday essentials.” 
Since the Age Credit is income-tested, it will benefit low to middle
income seniors.  With this measure, an
individual aged 65 could receive up to $150 more per year and a couple could
receive up to $300 more per year. 
“Our commitment is clear: it’s time for you to get ahead. This $300 tax
relief for senior couples is on top of our Universal
Tax Cut for all Canadians. We will also eliminate the GST from home heating
costs and introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit. Seniors will benefit
from all those tax cuts and file a single tax return in Québec, as we committed
to do,” concluded Mr. Scheer.
This increase will be the third of its kind made by a Conservative
government. In 2006, and again in 2009, Canada’s Conservatives increased the
Age Tax Credit by $1,000.

Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, today released the following statement:
“Today is the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland, which started the Second World War. On September 1, 1939 Adolf Hitler sent his troops into Poland, a week after signing the Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. During the first few days of the invasion, the German Army was able to destroy the Polish Air Force and capture much of the Polish Army.
“Sixteen days after Germany invaded Poland from the west, the Soviet Army launched its own invasion from the east, which led to the death of nearly a million innocent Poles in just the first few weeks of the occupation. Poland’s initial defeat in its defensive war of 1939 did not break the spirit of the Polish people, who formed the biggest underground movement in Europe in order to defend their country.
“On September 10, 1939, Canada joined the Second World War, serving in six battles and becoming instrumental in ensuring the Allied victory. At that time, for a country with only 11 million people, Canada’s contribution to the War was incredibly significant as more than one million Canadians and Newfoundlanders served in the military. Of these military troops, over 45,000 gave their lives and another 55,000 were wounded. By the end of the War, Canada had become a major military power with one of the largest navies in the world, the fourth largest air force, and an army of six divisions.
“The Second World War remains one of the darkest and most traumatic events in world history. Then as now, Canadians stood for freedom, human rights, and the dignity of all.
“Let us never forget the Canadian and Allied heroes who fought in this war, fighting for democracy and fundamental human rights.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I encourage all Canadians to take the time to educate themselves about the history of World War II and Canada’s valiant role in the Allied victory.

Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, released the following statement on the 77th Anniversary of the Dieppe Raid:
“Today we remember a crucial day in the history of our country and the world. In the dark days of 1942 when Nazi forces occupied most of Europe, 5000 Canadian soldiers went forth to Dieppe, Puys, and Pourville. What would be later known as the Dieppe Raid, laid the groundwork for a successful D-Day invasion in 1944.
“Though the raid would provide crucial information and intelligence to the allied forces, the attack on August 19th was one of the costliest battles that our country  has ever been a part of. Just 2,210 Canadian soldiers returned from France, many of whom were injured.
“Canada’s heroes proved once again their courage and valour on that battlefield, two of whom earned the Victoria Cross for their bravery. They demonstrated to the people living under Nazi occupation that we would never give up the fight for freedom.
“Today, I encourage all Canadians to join me in honouring the souls lost, taken prisoner, and injured during the Dieppe Raid and all who fought for Canada throughout World War II, lest we forget. I also ask Canadians to take a moment to thank the brave and men women of the Canadian Armed Forces who continue to protect our freedom today.”

Tonight, the Liberal Party will nominate a new candidate in the riding of Pierrefonds-Dollards. Justin Trudeau’s preferred candidate in the riding is Sameer Zuberi – a radical activist whose student activism targeted Jewish groups on the Concordia University campus and who has promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11.
When Zuberi was Vice President of the Concordia Students Union, he helped lead a campaign to suspend Hillel, a non-partisan Jewish student organization, from club status.
Jewish students on campus know all too well about the rampant antisemitism they face on campus. Radical student unions consistently try to use technicalities and process to shut-down Jewish-Canadians’ right to freedom of speech and freedom of association on campus as a way to mask their rampant antisemitism.
The fact that this Liberal nomination candidate helped lead the charge should be a red flag for the Liberal Party, however, they have kept him on and green lit him as a candidate.
This is part of a larger trend of festering antisemitism within the ranks of the Liberal Party of Canada. A couple weeks ago, the Liberal Party of Canada was forced to remove a candidate for horribly antisemitic and anti-Israel comments. The Liberal Party knew about these comments for months and were working on a PR campaign to cover them up. It was only once this became a media story that they removed him as a candidate.
Justin Trudeau has still not personally addressed these comments.
Zuberi has also promoted conspiracy theories about the terrorist attacks on 9/11. He commented on Facebook that Bin Laden’s role in 9/11 “is still a matter of public debate.”
9/11 was the most horrific terrorist attack the western world has ever seen.
The facts are not still a matter of public debate.
Osama Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda, and Canada’s and America’s enemies orchestrated a direct attack on our way of life and the freedoms we hold dear.
These conspiracy theories are offensive to the more than 3,000 people who died on that horrible day – including 24 Canadians. Anybody who peddles them is unfit for public office.
Justin Trudeau needs to do the right thing and immediately fire this candidate.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued a statement on Justin Trudeau’s flip flop on his approach to China:
“Justin Trudeau’s sudden change of heart on China is nothing more than a desperate election-year flip flop.
“After years of failed attempts to win favour with Beijing and months of doing nothing while China detains Canadian citizens and blocks important Canadian exports, Trudeau expects Canadians to believe he will suddenly and finally stand up to China with strength and resolve. Meanwhile, he refuses to pull Canadian tax dollars out of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. This is empty rhetoric and a desperate and transparent political manoeuvre that China will see for exactly what it is.
“It is no coincidence that Trudeau’s flip flop comes on the eve of an election and only after Conservatives have clearly and consistently articulated a strong approach to China that puts Canada’s interests first.
“It’s worth noting that Trudeau is, at heart, an admirer of China’s ‘basic dictatorship.’ If he’s re-elected this fall, he will resume his policy of appeasement with China.
“Canadians should know that Trudeau’s sudden shift on China is simply not as advertised.”

Privacy and Ethics have called for an emergency committee meeting so that
parliamentarians can receive a briefing from the Conflict of Interest and
Ethics Commissioner. 
 
Yesterday, the Commissioner released the “Trudeau II Report” which found that
“The Prime Minister, directly and through his senior officials, used
various means to exert influence over Ms. Wilson Raybould. The authority of the
Prime Minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately
attempt to discredit the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as
well as the authority of Ms. Wilson Raybould as the Crown’s chief law officer.”
 
MPs Peter Kent and Jacques Gourde sent a letter to the Chair of the Standing
Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics today requesting an
urgent briefing on this important issue.  In January 2018, former Ethics
Commissioner Mary Dawson appeared at the Committee to provide a similar
briefing on the “Trudeau Report”.  Should the committee agree,
Conservatives intend to move the following motion:
 
That, given the
unprecedented nature of the Trudeau II Report, the Committee invite the
Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to brief the Committee on his
report, and that the Committee invite any further witnesses as required based
on the testimony of the Commissioner.
 
“The Commissioner’s findings are incredibly concerning and show that Justin
Trudeau used the power of his office to reward his friends and punish his
critics.  This is a grave situation.  Not only is Mr. Trudeau the
first Prime Minister to have been found guilty of breaking the law, he is a
repeat offender. Canadians deserve fulsome answers to the many remaining
questions,” said MP Kent.

Taxpayer handouts to wealthy executives, shareholders, and foreign companies to be eliminated, savings to be redirected to Canadians 
Today, Andrew Scheer announced that as Prime
Minister he will appoint Kevin Falcon, the former deputy premier and finance
minister of British Columbia, and Yves Desjardins-Siciliano, the former
president and CEO of VIA Rail Canada, to lead the Commission on
the Reduction of Government Subsidy Programs to Corporations. This is the first
announcement of Andrew Scheer’s 100 Day Action Plan – the steps a new
Conservative government would take to help Canadians get ahead. 
“You shouldn’t have to be a billionaire to get your
government’s attention,” Scheer said. “You deserve a government, and a Prime
Minister, whose first priority will be to help you get ahead.”
The Commission on
the Reduction of Government Subsidy Programs to Corporations will
review all business subsidy programs, including grants and contributions to
corporations. The commission’s mandate will include:
Reducing corporate subsidies by $1.5 billion
per yearRecommending performance metrics for corporate
subsidy programsReviewing innovation programs to ensure that
they are supporting Canadian companies that provide benefits, profits and
patents that stay in Canada.
The commission will be operated out of the Department
of Finance. A new Conservative government will also strengthen Canada’s regional development agencies, focusing on helping
small and medium businesses to grow.
“There is a truism I’ve
learned watching governments of all stripes throw taxpayer dollars at
undeserving corporations. Governments have a terrible record of picking between
winners and losers. I’m proud to have been part of a government that eliminated
all corporate subsidies, grants and equity investments to individual for-profit
businesses. I applaud the Conservative party and Andrew Scheer for their
commitment to scale back this corporate welfare and redirect it where it
belongs, in the pockets of Canadian families,” Falcon said. 
“As in
all areas of government, spending taxpayers’ money must be efficient and
produce the greatest benefits to Canada’s economy. I’m honoured to co-chair
this review with a distinguished Canadian, and I’m confident our review will
yield the expected benefits,” said Desjardins-Siciliano. 
“Hard-working
Canadians are rightly offended when they see their tax dollars going to further
the interests of the wealthy and well-connected friends, while Justin Trudeau
makes them pay more for gasoline, groceries, and home heating,” Scheer said.

OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues the following statement to mark Italian Heritage Month:
“Today I extend warm greetings to Canadians of Italian descent who join Italians around the world to mark Italian Heritage Month, as well as tomorrow’s Italian Republic Day.
“We are fortunate to have so many Canadians of Italian heritage who have chosen, or whose ancestors have chosen, to make our country their home. The Italian community has contributed significantly to our country’s social and economic fabric and we are grateful to have their culture, art, and cuisine as part of our cultural diversity.
“After the Second World War, the Italian state was reconstituted as the Republic of Italy, and Italian people were once again able to live under freedom, democracy, and the rule of law – values that are shared by Canadians and contribute to the close bond between our two countries. Canada can take great pride in the role our armed forces played in liberating Italy in the Second World War and contributing to this process of reconstruction.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my best wishes to all Canadians of Italian background as they gather with their families and friends this month to celebrate Italian heritage!”

“Today, my thoughts are with the families of the victims, the survivors, and the many communities that have felt the pain of these tragedies.

Under my leadership, a Conservative government will develop and implement a National Action Plan, in partnership with Indigenous peoples, to advance reconciliation, address violence and achieve measurable improvements in the day-to-day lives of Indigenous women and girls.
“There are a number of ‘Calls to Justice’ in today’s report that could meaningfully improve the lives of Indigenous women and girls, including the standardization of protocols so all cases are thoroughly investigated and establishing a national task force to review and, if required, to reinvestigate cases across Canada.
“Conservatives will carefully review the details of this final report and continue to hold the Trudeau government to account to ensure that the Inquiry’s report results in closure, peace and solutions for the victims’ families.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issued the following statement on the 30th Anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre:
“Today, Canadians of Chinese heritage join Chinese people around the world to remember the victims who were horrifically attacked at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4th, 1989.
“After weeks of peaceful demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, which means ‘gate of heavenly peace’, military troops marched and opened fire on the crowd of unarmed civilians, killing hundreds, possibly thousands of people. Thousands of survivors were arrested and dozens of others were executed for their participation in the demonstrations, which were thereby suppressed. This violent crackdown on Chinese people peacefully expressing their views by Communist Party rulers is deeply troubling.
“Thirty years later, many Chinese citizens are still persecuted for their efforts to speak out or even commemorate the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen protests, including the relatives of those that were killed.
“I believe that the right to speak freely, as well as the rights to free assembly and association, are inherent human rights and fundamental to any peaceful society. I encourage everyone to remember the victims of the human rights violations that occurred in Tiananmen Square 30 years ago. By publicly acknowledging a difficult past, nations can move towards a more prosperous and harmonious future by firmly resolving to never again let these atrocities happen. I hope that the memory of these events will lead to peace, mutual respect, and recognition of everyone’s right to their freedom and dignity.
“Canada’s Conservatives will always speak out against injustices that take place around the world, standing for freedom, democracy and human rights wherever these fundamental values are under attack.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I join all Canadians of Chinese heritage and Chinese people around the world to remember the victims of Tiananmen Square.”

Yesterday,
Justin Trudeau was in British Columbia to talk about housing, but he failed to
mention the secret Liberal plan to introduce a capital gains tax. 
In 2018, a
senior Trudeau Liberal MP heavily involved in housing policy wrote up a plan
for a 50 per cent tax on hard-working Canadians selling their homes. 
Conservative
Deputy Leader Lisa Raitt said the secret homeowner tax is exactly the kind of
costly new measures a re-elected Liberal government will force upon Canadians.
“This new
homeowner tax would cost Canadians who sell their homes thousands of dollars,”
said Conservative Deputy Leader Lisa Raitt. “In public, Justin Trudeau pretends
to want to help homeowners, but behind closed doors, his team is planning to
hit them hard with a new tax that will cost them thousands. As usual, Trudeau
is not as advertised.”
Behind closed
doors, the Trudeau
Liberals have also proposed soda tax
that would increase the cost of some of the most popular drinks in Canada. 
The Trudeau
Liberals also have a secret plan to hike the carbon tax, which the Minister of
Environment slipped up and made public. So-far, they have refused to answer any
questions about just how high this carbon tax will go, but the independent
Parliamentary Budget Officer found they would have to increase their carbon tax
by five times in order to meet their Paris Targets. 
“Justin Trudeau has spent the last four years making life harder and more expensive for Canadian families. If the Trudeau Liberals are re-elected, they are just going to dip back into the taxpayers’ pocket to pay for their out of control spending,” added Raitt. “Only Andrew Scheer and Canada’s Conservative have a plan to put more money in your pockets to help you get ahead.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issues statement on 13th anniversary of the Chinese Head Tax Apology:
“Today, Canadians mark the 13th anniversary of an important apology made by the Conservative Government of Canada to the Canadian Chinese community for the grave injustice of the Chinese Head Tax.
“During the 19th century, the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway sparked an influx of Chinese immigration to Canada during the early years of the Dominion. Chinese immigration was beneficial to the development of our country, yet beginning in 1885, the government imposed a discriminatory and onerous ‘head tax,’ on the Chinese, which they were forced to pay to come to Canada. Following the removal of the tax, the Chinese Immigration Act then banned Chinese immigration to Canada from 1923 to 1947.
“This was truly a dark chapter in Canada’s history. Prime Minister Stephen Harper called it a ‘grave injustice’ and ‘one that we are morally obligated to acknowledge’ during his formal apology in the House of Commons on June 22, 2006.
“Today, over one million Canadians of Chinese heritage call Canada home. They have greatly enriched Canada by their contributions and we are grateful for the tremendous dedication that they have shown in helping build our country.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I encourage all Canadians to take this opportunity to reflect on the important contributions made by Chinese Canadians to our great country.”

Keep Canada united and strong by launching a task force to study the establishment of a national energy corridor, which could bring      Ontario and Quebec hydroelectricity to new markets, open up opportunities for Western Canadian oil and gas, and connect rural communities in Atlantic Canada and the North.Help Canadians get ahead by offering broad-based tax relief, providing a date for balancing the budget, and proceeding with fair tax-free maternity benefits.Restore ethics and accountability to government by introducing stronger penalties in the Conflict of Interest Act.Get the energy sector back to work by tabling a detailed plan, with concrete deadlines, to build the Trans Mountain expansion and repealing Bills C-48 and C-69.Take real action on the environment by drawing on policies from our Real Plan to Protect the Environment, such as the Green Patent Credit, the Canadian Clean brand, the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, and ending raw sewage dumps.Immediately fund regional transit expansion in the GTA, starting with the Ontario Line and Yonge Extension.Reduce the paperwork burden on Quebecers by adopting a single tax return.

Trudeau’s story has changed at least four times since 2001
After media reports revealed that Justin
Trudeau wore blackface during an event at West Point Grey Academy, Canadians
have been asking why exactly Justin Trudeau left his teaching job at the
school. It’s understandable why people have questions, after all Trudeau’s
story has changed four times since 2001. 
First, the Ottawa Citizen reported in 2001
that Trudeau would “give up his teaching job at
a Vancouver private school next September to give speeches.” Several days later
this claim was refuted by Trudeau in a statement issued by lawfirm Heenan
Blaikie. The Montreal Gazette reported Trudeau was accepting a teaching job at
a public school. 
In his 2014 autobiography, Trudeau says he
left the school after a dispute with the administration over an article written
in the school newspaper. According to Trudeau, he convinced a student to write
an article criticizing the fact that the girls at the school were never
reprimanded for the way they dress. This article was deemed disrespectful by
the school’s administration. 
The Vancouver Sun reported in 2015 that the reason Trudeau left the school was “in part over a dispute over dress code and values.”
In a 2019
book by John Ivison, Trudeau’s departure is summed up as “a disagreement over
an article written by a student for which Trudeau was responsible”.
On October 4, 2019 Trudeau said he left the school “because [he] was moving on
with [his] life”.
That same day, the former headmaster of
the school said that Trudeau left the school because he was going to study to
be an engineer. 
Why did Justin Trudeau leave West Point
Grey Academy? What’s the real reason? Why has his story changed so many times,
and if the above reports are incorrect, why hasn’t Trudeau corrected the
record? 
Trudeau will have the opportunity tonight
to tell Canadians the truth.

Justin Trudeau is planning to raise taxes on

He’s raised taxes all while failing to
introduce the senior’s price index which has put even more financial pressure

Unlike Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer has a plan to put nearly $700 back in the pocket of seniors by reducing income taxes on pensions, taking GST off home heating, and cancelling the carbon tax.
Trudeau is making promises to seniors now
because he needs your vote. But just like in 2015 he will break his promises
because he is not as advertised. 
Only an Andrew Scheer government can be trusted
to stand up for seniors and help you get ahead.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew
Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, today
issued the following statement regarding the Final Report of the National
Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls:
“Today, my thoughts are with the families of the victims, the
survivors, and the many communities that have felt the pain of these tragedies.
“Canada’s Conservatives support the process of reconciliation with
Canada’s Indigenous peoples. Under my leadership, a Conservative government
will develop and implement a National Action Plan, in partnership with
Indigenous peoples, to advance reconciliation, address violence and achieve
measurable improvements in the day-to-day lives of Indigenous women and girls.

the standardization of protocols so all cases are thoroughly investigated and
establishing a national task force to review and, if required, to reinvestigate
cases across Canada.
“Conservatives will carefully review the details of this final
report and continue to hold the Trudeau government to account to ensure that

There is one set of rules for Trudeau Liberals and another set of rules for the rest of us
Media are reporting that Trudeau Liberal,
Sven Spengemann didn’t disclose his position as a director of cannabis
start-up, Andean Farm and Pharma Corp. The company is co-founded by Liberal
insider, Dan Veniez.
Corporate cronyism has become all too common under Justin
Trudeau. It’s not surprising that Mr. Spengemann believed he could get away
with this after Justin Trudeau bent to the will of the corporate lobbyists at
SNC-Lavalin.

It’s clear that there are one set of rules for Trudeau and his friends, and
another set of rules for the rest of us.

Justin Trudeau and his Liberal candidates have no respect for rules and it’s
clear that he cannot be trusted. If re-elected, Justin Trudeau will continue to
break laws and grant insider access to Liberals and corporate lobbyists.

Under Prime Minister Andrew Scheer the corruption in Ottawa will end. It starts
with introducing legislation to attach stiff penalties for violating ethics
laws and strengthen the powers of parliamentary watchdogs.

A Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer will uphold the rule of law,
respect our democratic institutions, and help all Canadians get ahead.

Justin Trudeau’s plan to take up to half of the
profits from the sale of your home began back in 2016 when he started
making Canadians report the sale of their homes to the Canada Revenue Agency.
LINK: Sale of your principal residence
Canadians know that whenever the CRA gets
involved it can only mean one thing: More money out of their pockets.
The question is: Why else would the Liberals
need to know how much money you make on the sale of your home if they didn’t
want to take a chunk of it?
In 2018, behind closed doors in a Liberal caucus
meeting, Justin Trudeau’s housing expert Adam Vaughan proposed a secret plan to
implement a tax on up to 50% of the profits on the sale of your home. 
This official
policy proposal from the Liberal caucus
promotes “increasing the capital gains” tax on your home and details a “50% tax
after one year of ownership, 25% after two years, 15% after 3 years, 10% after
4 years, 5% after five.” 
Brace yourselves Canada: Justin Trudeau is
coming for your wallet, only after the election, when he doesn’t need your
vote, but still needs your money. 
FACT:
Trudeau will need more of your money to pay for his never ending deficits
FACT: Trudeau’s
candidates have already admitted the carbon tax will keep going up.
FACT: Trudeau
said he’d lower taxes on the middle class. Instead, he’s raised them on 80% of
middle class families
FACT: Trudeau
said he’d balance the budget in 2019. Instead, he’s running massive deficits
that will mean higher taxes.
You just can’t trust Justin Trudeau. He is not
as advertised.
If Justin Trudeau is re-elected, life will
continue to get harder and more expensive with endless tax hikes to pay for his
deficits and out-of-control spending. 
Only Andrew Scheer and Canada’s Conservatives
have a plan to put more money in your pockets to help you get ahead.

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   St. Catharines, ON – This morning, Andrew Scheer, the Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition, sent the below letter to the RCMP Commissioner regarding the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal:   Commissioner,   I am following up on my correspondence of February 28, wherein I wrote to you to draw your attention to troubling events related to Justin Trudeau’s attempts to interfere in the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin.   You will recall I noted at the time that Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former Attorney General of Canada, confirmed in testimony to Parliament that there were “veiled threats” of consequences from Trudeau and his office if she did not overrule the Director of Public Prosecutions’ (DPP) decision not to award a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) to SNC-Lavalin.   In other words, Ms. Wilson-Raybould would be punished for refusing the bend to Trudeau’s political will and SNC-Lavalin’s financial interests.   Canadians learned last week that the RCMP have begun looking into this situation and interviewing those implicated. This was most certainly a welcome revelation, as many Canadians are keenly interested in how Trudeau will be held accountable.   Criminal investigations are, of course, entirely within your purview. I wish only to note, as I did in February, that it is contrary to section 139 of the Criminal Code for anybody to “obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.”   As you know, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has released an extraordinarily detailed report into this matter.   The Commissioner’s report represents independent and incontrovertible confirmation of Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s Parliamentary testimony, while also introducing several previously unknown facts to the case.   Therefore, it must be regarded as the most important piece of evidence in this matter.   There are several elements of the report that would be relevant to any investigation that you may undertake in this matter.   The Commissioner stated “The Prime Minister, directly and through his senior officials, used various means to exert influence over Ms. Wilson-Raybould. The authority of the Prime Minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms. Wilson-Raybould as the Crown’s chief law officer.”   On a plain reading of the language used by the Commissioner, Trudeau’s actions would fall within the contours of “obstructing, perverting or defeating the course of justice.”  As the report makes clear, he specifically undertook a campaign to do just that in respect of the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin.   This is evident in three main findings of the Commissioner: 
The Commissioner found that in
     addition to the numerous discussions of the financial interests of
     SNC-Lavalin, there were at least four times that political interests were
     discussed with Ms. Wilson-Raybould. Despite SNC-Lavalin filing a
     judicial review of the DPP’s refusal to grant them DPA, and despite Privy
     Council advice to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to avoid contact with
     SNC-Lavalin during the review process, contact between the PMO and
     SNC-Lavalin drastically increased. This included discussion of possible
     resolutions and litigation strategies, despite the clear impropriety of
     engaging in such discussions. The PMO/SNC-Lavalin discussions
     led to both parties approaching a former Chief Justice of the Supreme
     Court of Canada to meet with Ms. Wilson-Raybould and advise her to
     overrule the DPP.  This was done without Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s
     knowledge. 
Together, these findings reveal the degree to which the PMO and
SNC-Lavalin maneuvered in secret to manipulate the administration of justice by
both the DPP and the Attorney General.
 
Essentially, the same PMO
operatives who were pressuring Ms. Wilson-Raybould to overturn the decision of
an independent prosecutor were scheming behind closed doors with the defendant.
Indeed, they were advocating on the defendant’s behalf.
 
Further, they paint a
disturbing picture of a Prime Minister who uses the power of his office to
decide who gets prosecuted and who does not, based solely on his own partisan
political interests.
 
The implications of this –
on everything from the integrity of Canada’s highest political office, to the
independence of our judicial system, to the very rule of law – cannot be
overstated.
 
The powerful and
politically connected absolutely cannot be above the law. The law must be for
all.
 
I believe I speak for
millions of Canadians by requesting that you use all the resources at your
disposal to investigate this matter, not only so that justice is done but so
that it is seen to be done.
 
Thank you for your ongoing
attention to this critically important matter.
 
Sincerely,
 
The Hon. Andrew Scheer,
P.C., M.P.
Leader of the Official
Opposition

A new Conservative government will also boost the Adoption Expense Tax Credit
Andrew Scheer will make it easier for
Canadian families to welcome a new child into their home by introducing EI
adoption leave benefits for adoptive parents and boosting the Adoption Expense
Tax Credit, David Sweet, the Conservative candidate for Flamborough-Glanbrook,
announced today.
“Every year, thousands of Canadians adopt a child. By
opening their homes and their hearts, these families provide stability, love,
and a brighter future for some of the most vulnerable in Canada and around the
world,” Sweet said. “Adoption is one of the most selfless things a Canadian can
do. At the same time, it can also involve significant investments of time and money.
Andrew Scheer will make it easier for Canadians to begin, expand, or complete
their family through adoption.”
A new Conservative government will introduce 15 weeks of
EI adoption leave benefits for Canadians who adopt a child under the age of 18.
A new Conservative government will also amend the Income Tax Act to boost the
Adoption Expense Tax Credit to $20,000, and make the tax credit fully
refundable. As a result, those who pay little to no federal income tax will be
eligible for up to the maximum amount.
Currently, the maximum tax savings a Canadian adoptive
family is eligible to receive in 2020 is $2,482. Under a new Conservative
government, that same family will receive $3,000,
which is an increase of $518. The tax credit
will continue to be indexed as is currently the case.
“Introducing EI adoption leave benefits for adoptive
parents and boosting the Adoption Expense Tax Credit are two of the measures a
new Conservative government will introduce to help Canadian families get
ahead,” Sweet said.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit,      saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit,      allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax      Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and      learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50%, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit,      putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians for green home improvements.

Trudeau continues to assert that media stories are false despite ruling that he broke the law
Last night Justin Trudeau unrepentantly lied
again to Canadians about the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal. In a debate
exchange with Mr. Scheer, Justin Trudeau shockingly asserted that a Globe and Mail
story, which first detailed how Justin Trudeau attempted to interfere in an
ongoing corruptions and fraud court case, was false.

How do Canadians know Justin Trudeau lied last night? Check the record:
Trudeau was investigated by the Ethics Commissioner who determined he broke the law over the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal; Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould confirmed      to a House of Commons committee that Trudeau pressured her to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin court case;Trudeau’s two most senior staff resigned in disgrace and former cabinet minister Jane Philpot resigned      in protest over Trudeau’s unethical behavior; andThe RCMP were blocked from investigating Justin Trudeau’s office.
Despite all this, Justin Trudeau still says the Globe and
Mail story is false.
Why? Because Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. He is a
fraud and he does not deserve to govern this country.
To ensure this never happens again, a Conservative
government will launch a judicial inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin corruption
scandal and introduce the No More Cover Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access
information protected by cabinet confidence.

Regina, Saskatchewan
– The Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, the
Honourable Andrew Scheer, has asked his Members of Parliament on the Public
Safety and National Security Committee to contact the other members of the
committee in order to convene an emergency meeting regarding the personal data
breach at Desjardins.
 
“We must act quickly to help the 2.9 million Desjardins members affected by the
theft of their personal data.  This situation is unacceptable.  The
Public Safety and National Security Committee must meet as soon as possible to
find solutions for Desjardins clients so that they can to protect their
identities,” said the Conservative Leader.
 
Committee members will be able to study a number of ways to prevent the theft
of personal data like at Desjardins. Elected officials will also be able to
study whether or not issuing new social insurance numbers is a viable solution
for Desjardins members.
 
“The members of the committee must work to find possible solutions to
lessen the negative repercussions for Desjardins members. Also, the federal
government must put measures in place to ensure that this situation never
happens again. Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau’s inaction on this issue is not
surprising,” said Scheer.
 
The Member of Parliament for Charlesbourg – Haute-Saint-Charles and Shadow
Minister for Public Security, Border Security and Emergency Preparedness,
Pierre Paul-Hus, will contact the Chair and the other members of the committee
so that an emergency meeting can be held as early as this week.

A new Conservative government will put money back in the pockets of Canadians
Today, the Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, announced
that as Prime Minister, he would introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit to
reduce the cost of public transit and put more money back in the pockets of
Canadians. 
“For so many Canadians, especially our students, young
professionals, young families, and seniors, the cost of public transit can be a
significant out-of-pocket expense. The Green Public Transit Tax Credit will
provide much-needed relief to transit users and commuters so they can just
worry about getting home on time, and not so much about their bottom line.” 
A
family of four in the Greater Toronto Area that regularly takes the TTC would
save almost $1,000 per year with a new Conservative Government’s Green Public Transit
Tax Credit. A young professional regularly commuting on GO Transit from Oshawa
to downtown Toronto would save around $650 per year. 
The
Credit will be for transit passes that allow for unlimited travel within Canada
on local busses, streetcars, subways, commuter trains, and ferries. Some
electronic fare cards and weekly passes can be eligible if they are used on an
ongoing basis.
The Trudeau Liberals eliminated the Public Transit Tax
Credit in 2017 and hit the wallets of 1.8 million Canadians. This is exactly
what Canadians can expect with four more years of Trudeau, poor judgement,
higher taxes, more expenses. 
“Life
is expensive enough and the government should not make it more expensive,” said
Scheer. “My plan is about supporting Canadians and helping them reach their
goals by easing the daily pressures that they face just to get to work, or to
care for their kids, or to manage their homes. This tax credit means you can
worry a bit less.” 
The Green Public Transit
Tax Credit is an important part of A Real Plan to
Protect the Environment, Canada’s
Conservative’s plan to fight climate change by lowering emissions with our core
promise of leaving more money in Canadians’ pockets and letting them get ahead.

The Credit will also
reduce congestion on our roads and cut commute times for Canadians so that
everyone can get home faster at the end of the work day.
FACTS:
The Trudeau Liberals eliminated this tax
credit in Budget 2017. 
Eligible expenses will include monthly transit
passes, as well as weekly passes and electronic fare cards when used for an
extended period. Canadians will be able to claim the credit for transit costs
borne by themselves, their spouses, and children under the age of 19.By making it more affordable for Canadians to
use public transit, we will reduce the number of cars on the road. This will
decrease congestion, allowing Canadians to get home faster at the end of the
workday. It will also help our environment as more Canadians choose public
transit.It is easy to claim the Green Public Transit Tax
Credit as online passes can be claimed.

 Justin Trudeau has been misleading Canadians every step of the way during the SNC-Lavalin scandal.  He said the original Globe and Mail story was “false.” We now know that’s not true.  He said he did not interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. We now know that’s not true.  He said Jody Wilson-Raybould never raised any concerns with him. We now know that’s not true.  Justin Trudeau’s press conference today was no different. Here’s a fact-check of some of Justin Trudeau’s misleading statements.  Justin Trudeau: “It was not a small thing for our government to decide to waive both solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence in the matter…we took that decision because we knew that it was important that Canadians and obviously the ethics commissioner would be able to access all the information and hear all testimony in regards to the matter at hand.”  FACT:  Justin Trudeau has not waived cabinet confidence in its entirety, instead cleverly crafting the wording to ensure certain key details are not made public.  The Ethics Commissioner specifically said in his report that he did not have access to all of the necessary information: “The decision made by the Privy Council Office to deny our Office access to a full range of Cabinet confidences meant nine witnesses were constrained in providing our Office with the full body of evidence potentially relevant to the examination. I believe that decisions relating to my access to such information should be made transparently and democratically by Parliament, not by the very same public office holders who are subject to the regime I administer.”  The Ethics Commissioner added, “During this examination, nine witnesses informed our Office that they had information they believed to be relevant, but that could not be disclosed because, according to them, this information would reveal a confidence of the Queen’s Privy Council and would fall outside the scope of Order in Council 2019-0105.”  The Trudeau Liberals are still preventing Jody Wilson-Raybould from sharing her side of the story after she was fired as Attorney General.  Justin Trudeau: “I can’t apologize for standing up for Canadian jobs.”  FACT:  The motive behind the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal is clearly the Liberal Party’s political self-interests – not Canadian jobs.  The Ethics Commissioner found that on four separate occasions partisan political interests were raised with Jody Wilson-Raybould.  In her testimony to the Justice Committee, Jody Wilson-Raybould said that the Prime Minister told her “I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” Wilson-Raybould also said that a senior Trudeau Liberal staffer told her team that “if six months from the election SNC announces they’re moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said, “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.””  The Ethics Commissioner added in his report that, “While SNC-Lavalin would have benefited from Ms. Wilson‑Raybould’s intervention in the matter, the evidence showed that the governing party also considered the partisan political consequences of not being able to secure a remediation agreement for the company.”  When the Minister of Finance was asked by the Ethics Commissioner about whether any economic analysis was conducted into the consequences of not providing a DPA to SNC-Lavalin he said no: “When asked if he, or his office, had undertaken a study or analysis of the economic impacts of the Director of Public Prosecutions’ decision, Mr. Morneau testified that none had been conducted.”  It’s clear the only jobs Justin Trudeau cared about were his own and those of his Liberal MPs.  Justin Trudeau: “As I said, I take full responsibility. The buck stops with the prime minister.”  FACT:  Trudeau’s legal counsel made the following argument to the Ethics Commissioner: “Third, Mr. Trudeau’s counsel argued that even if his ministerial staff and the Clerk of the Privy Council act on behalf of the Prime Minister when engaging with other ministers or their representatives, Mr. Trudeau cannot be vicariously liable for the actions of his staff since, according to counsel, liability under the Act is personal and based on subjective intent.”  Justin Trudeau: “Where I disagree with the commissioner amongst others is where he says and takes a strong perspective that any contact with the attorney general on this issue was improper.”  FACT:  As the Ethics Commissioner wrote, “Simply seeking to influence the decision of another person is insufficient for there to be a contravention of section 9.”  What the Ethics Commissioner found is that the Prime Minister improperly interfered in a criminal trial in order to suit his partisan self-interests.  This is not the first-time Justin Trudeau has disagreed with the Ethics Commissioner. When he was found guilty of breaking ethics laws for taking a luxury vacation on a private island on the dime of the Aga Khan, the Prime Minister disagreed with the Ethics Commissioner’s definition of his relationship with the Aga Khan.  Justin Trudeau can’t pick and choose the recommendations and conclusions of the Ethics Commissioner, who is an independent officer of Parliament.

Conservatives to review and eliminate taxpayer handouts to wealthy executives, shareholders, and foreign companies 
A new Conservative government will
cancel hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate welfare handouts to wealthy
executives, shareholders, and foreign companies and instead put that money in
Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today.
Scheer said a new Conservative
government will conduct a review of all business subsidy programs in order to
eliminate $1.5 billion in corporate handouts that don’t create jobs and support
economic growth in Canada. 
Those savings would instead go towards
new measures to help hard-working Canadians.
“Under Justin Trudeau, Canada’s
wealthiest and most politically connected have received billions of dollars
from Canadian taxpayers, who are working harder than ever and just not getting
ahead,” Scheer said. “I will put an end to handouts to wealthy executives,
shareholders, and foreign companies and instead put that money in Canadians’
pockets so they can get ahead.”
A new
Conservative government will also review innovation programs to ensure that
they are supporting Canadian companies with patents, technologies, and economic
benefits that remain in Canada. Conservatives believe that government support
should help Canadians by creating jobs and opportunities.

Conservatives
will make sure
that funds spent on research and development will benefit Canadian companies,
so that the intellectual property, technology, and resulting profits will
benefit Canadians.
Conservatives
will also strengthen regional development agencies and mandate them to focus on
economic development, small- and medium-enterprises, and community-based
projects. 
“Hard-working Canadians are rightly offended when they
see their tax dollars going to further the interests of the wealthy and
well-connected friends while Justin Trudeau makes them pay more for gasoline,
groceries, and home heating,” Scheer said. “That’s why I’ll get rid of these
unfair handouts and use those savings to help Canadians get ahead.” 
As
Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Cancel
Trudeau’s Carbon TaxRemove
GST from home heating, saving households $107Make
maternity benefits tax-free, providing up to $4,000 in tax savings Bring
in a Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving families hundreds – potentially
thousands – of dollarsBring

in the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, saving parents up to $150Bring
in the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, saving parents up to $75Boost

People affected by the recent data theft at Desjardins Group are rightly concerned.   “This is why we have asked, at the initiative of Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, that the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security be reconvened for a meeting in order to help Desjardins Group leaders in their efforts to protect and reassure their members, and to find solutions to guarantee the safety of Canadians in the future.   “It is deplorable to see once again the inaction of Justin Trudeau’s Liberals, who have done absolutely nothing to support Desjardins Group. But it is no surprise – we are used to this government’s insensitivity on issues that directly affect Canadians.”   “Only a Conservative government will take a serious look at the challenges of protecting the privacy and personal information of Canadians.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Ottawa, ON
– The Honourable Andrew Scheer, the Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the
Official Opposition, issued the following statement on the passing of Member of
Parliament Mark Warawa:

“I cannot begin to express the sorrow and loss Jill and I feel today
at the passing of MP Mark Warawa.
Mark and I were
first elected to Parliament at the same time, in 2004, and I will always have
fond memories learning the Ottawa ropes together. He was always a source of
wisdom and advice and was always there for our whole team.
Mark was an example
to which all Parliamentarians should aspire. A respectful contributor to the
debate, a fierce advocate for his constituents, and a strong defender of his
principles.
Mark was a true
gentleman. And while his warmth and kindness knew no partisan bounds, his love
for his Conservative family was special. The Conservative caucus is devastated.
He will be missed dearly.
Most of all, Mark
was an exemplary family man – endlessly devoted to his wife Diane, his five
children, and 10 grandchildren. Jill and I are praying that God will comfort
Mark’s family at this time. 
In his last address
to the House of Commons, Mark left us with these words:
“I want to encourage
each of you to love one another, to encourage each other, because God loves us.
Pray for another. Pray about what is really important. Help one another. Seek
God’s will for you each day. Do what is right. Be honest.”
Thank you for
everything, Mark. You will be missed.”

 Two tax credits for kids’ activities mean more money in your pockets 
Today,
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, announced two tangible measures
so Canadians can worry less about their bottom line. 
“This
election will come down to one question: Who do you trust to put more money in
your pocket for you, for your family?” said Scheer. “I have a plan for all
Canadians to get ahead, starting with families who work so hard while raising
their kids.”
With
the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, a new Conservative government will:
Allow parents to claim
up to $1,000 per child for expenses related to fitness or sports-related
activities; Make the credit refundable so
low-income Canadians benefit most; and, Allow parents of children with
disabilities to claim an additional $500 per child, per year. 
With
the Children’s Arts and Learning
Tax Credit, a new Conservative government
will:
Allow parents to claim
up to $500 per child for expenses related to arts and educational activities; Make the credit refundable so
low-income Canadians benefit most;Make it flexible, so children can get
extra help studying a language or learning science, math or coding; and, Allow parents of children with
disabilities to claim double the amount, up to $1,000 per child, per year. 
Under
Justin Trudeau, Canadian families are under pressure and worried about their
future. Half of families are just $200 away from insolvency at the end of each
month. Canadian families’ net worth declined for the first time in a decade.
And because of Justin Trudeau’s carbon tax, every day essentials cost more and
more. 
“Young,
middle-class families are the future of this country. Instead of helping the
middle class like he promised, Justin Trudeau has made life more expensive,”
said Scheer. “I have a plan that will put more money in your pockets – for you,
for your kids. It’s time for you to get ahead.”
As
Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Cut taxes for every working Canadian by implementing the Universal Tax Cut;Support commuters with the Green Public Transit Tax Credit; and,Support young families by making EI maternity and parental benefits tax-free.
FACTS:
The
Trudeau Liberals cancelled two previously available tax credits (arts and
fitness).In
2017, Trudeau falsely claimed “low-income families don’t
benefit from tax breaks.” In fact, claimants of the two cancelled tax
cuts came from all income tax brackets, and from every region of the country.Nearly
1.78 million Canadian families claimed at least one of two previously available
tax credits (arts or fitness) in 2014 alone. That
year, more than 698,000 Ontario families, more than 411,000 Quebec families,
more than 223,000 B.C. families and more than 217,000 families in Alberta
families benefitted from these credits.Some
210,000 families making $40,000 or less (i.e., households in the lowest income
tax bracket) applied for and received these tax credits.

Trudeau refused to rule out legalizing more drugs in TVA debate
Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have left the door wide open to
legalizing hard drugs in Canada if re-elected. Trudeau refused to rule out the
possibility during the TVA debate saying he wouldn’t legalize hard drugs “right
now”.
Here is what Trudeau said: https://youtu.be/KZEgvB0iALc 
Parents who doubt Trudeau’s motivation need look no further than the radical positions on drug legalization of those running to be Liberal Members of Parliament across the country.


Studies have show that drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and
crystal meth are extremely dangerous substances that tear families apart, make
our communities unsafe, and have lasting effects on individuals who choose to
use them. 
In 2018, Liberals voted overwhelmingly to remove criminal
penalties for the possession of hard drugs: https://youtu.be/mad4EED9jyk
Trudeau’s plan to legalize all drugs is extremely
irresponsible, and Canadians deserve to know exactly how this will affect their
families and their communities.
Trudeau cannot be trusted to make responsible decisions for
Canadian families. He is not as advertised.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada issued the following statement for Pentecost:
“Today, Christians across Canada and around the world will celebrate the feast of Pentecost.
“Fifty days after Jesus’ Resurrection and ten days after His Ascension, the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus’ followers, gathered in the upper room with Jesus’ mother Mary.
“The Bible speaks of the Apostles being filled with the Holy Spirit, and they went out and in different languages, began preaching the Gospel to the Israelites gathered in Jerusalem from many different countries. Three thousand people were baptized on that first day, which has long been considered the birth of the Church.
“While the Church was founded by Jesus in Jerusalem, it very quickly spread to other nations and cultures, and today is found in every country around the world, including people of every culture and background. The great diversity of the Church is mirrored by Canada’s diversity, and the teachings of Jesus are held in the highest esteem by so many Canadians of every different background.
“This day is an important occasion to reflect on the history of the Church and on the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Christians seek to be the hands and feet of Jesus in our communities – to reach the broken and hurting, to welcome the oppressed and the down-trodden, and to love the lonely among us – which is made possible by the action of the Holy Spirit in our midst.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my very best wishes to all those celebrating Pentecost.”

“Canadians will have a clear choice to make this October.Between a new Conservative government that will live within its means and put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.
“And a re-elected Liberal government under Justin Trudeau, who has spent the last four years making your life more expensive while enriching his friends and punishing his critics.
“Trudeau can’t run on his record. He can’t possibly defend all of his broken promises, massive deficits, tax increases, and ethics scandals.
“That’s why he’s dredging up divisive social issues trying to distract Canadians from his litany of failures. That’s why he’s running away from the debate stage this fall.
“These debates will shape how Canadians make their decision at the ballot box. Trudeau is trying to shut them down because he’s afraid to defend his record.
“By refusing to attend these debates, Trudeau wants to force their cancellation, and rob Canadians of an opportunity to see him held to account. This is wrong and it shows a lack of leadership.
“So I urge Justin Trudeau to show some courage and to show up. To defend his record and his decisions over the last four years.

Finally, the dream of millions of Ukrainians came true as Ukraine declared its freedom from communism and independence from the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991. Canadians are extremely proud to have been the first country in the West to publicly recognize Ukraine’s sovereignty.“With almost 1.4 million Canadians tracing their heritage to Ukraine, our countries enjoy a special relationship. We are grateful for the contributions of the Ukrainian Canadian community over the last 128 years since the arrival of the first settlers to Canada in 1891.“Canada’s Conservatives have always defended Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Our previous Conservative government was at the forefront of opposing Vladimir Putin and his military aggression and violence in Ukraine following the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. By imposing a wide range of sanctions and providing critical military aid to Ukraine, Canada demonstrated our unequivocal support for Ukraine and its people.“Since the onset of the current conflict, we have been crystal clear that we will never recognize the Kremlin’s occupation of the Crimea and its military invasion of parts of the Donbas region. We will always stand by our friends and continue to condemn human rights violations and illegal persecutions on the occupied territories of Ukraine.“We will always side with those who value freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. We are proud that Operation UNIFIER, started by our previous Conservative government, has contributed significantly to training and building capacity for Ukrainian troops, who are fighting to defend their country.“On behalf of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Official Opposition, we wish everyone celebrating a happy Ukrainian Independence Day!“Slava Ukrayini!”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Vancouver, BC
– The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official
Opposition, today issued the following statement regarding Justin Trudeau’s
‘vision’ for the future of Canada’s natural resources:
 
“For four years Justin Trudeau has attacked Canadian energy workers and passed
laws that will make it harder for them to earn a living.  He told
Canadians in 2017 that he wanted to ‘phase out’ the oil sands and has since
passed several laws that will do exactly that. For once, Justin Trudeau is exactly
as advertised.
 
“Before Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister, Canada had three private
companies willing to invest more than $30 billion to build three
nation-building projects that would have created tens of thousands of jobs and
generated billions in economic activity. Today, none of those projects remain
thanks to Trudeau’s policies. Those companies continue to invest in pipelines
elsewhere in the world. Just not in Canada.
 
“The good news is that in October, Canadians will have a chance to elect a
Conservative government that will champion Canada’s natural resources.  As
Prime Minister, I will cancel the carbon tax, repeal Bill C-69, the
No-More-Pipelines Bill, end the BC shipping ban, establish timelines for
approvals, eliminate foreign interference in approvals process, and invoke
federal jurisdiction when necessary.
 
“I will also champion a national energy corridor for pipelines and transmission
lines that would allow these major, job-creating projects to get built while
also minimizing environmental impact. I am confident that our Conservative plan
will give Canada the best chance of having these kinds of projects succeed.
 
“While Trudeau divides Canadians and attacks our energy workers, Conservatives
have a plan to unite Canadians, get Canada’s resource sector back to work, and
help all Canadians get ahead.”

conservative,https://www.conservative.ca/justin-trudeaus-plastic-flub-2-0/,"
As per usual, the rules just don’t apply to Justin Trudeau. Weeks after making international headlines for announcing a sweeping ban on single-use plastics, the Prime Minister has come under criticism online for posting a photo of a pizza party on Twitter where piled up on the corner of the table are a bunch of single-use plastic forks and knives.

This is no different than how Justin Trudeau will lecture moms and dads driving their kids to and from hockey practice about their carbon footprint and force them to pay a punishing carbon tax one day, and then on the next day Justin Trudeau will jet away to Florida for a sunny weekend get-away.
When the Prime Minister’s Office was questioned about this botched photo-op, they responded by saying the plastic cutlery would be washed and re-used at future events. According to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, re-using plastic cutlery could lead to further degradation, the collection of bacteria in the curls and ridges, and the leaching of chemicals into foods and beverages.
A reporter was also quick to point out while on a Washington trip staff weren’t told to avoid using single-use plastics, rather just keep them out of photos with the Prime Minister. This plastic faux-pas comes after Justin Trudeau spectacularly failed to answer a simple question about the action his family has taken to reduce their usage of single-use plastics. Clearly, Justin Trudeau’s so-called environmentalism is Not as Advertised.

 Scheer details plan to help Canadians get ahead 
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives, emerged as the hands-down winner of the first televised leaders’
debate hosted by Maclean’s and Citytv.
Scheer articulated his positive vision for Canada and his
plan for a new Conservative government to live within its means and put more
money in Canadians pockets so they can get ahead.
Debate takeaways:
It is now clear that Andrew Scheer is the only leader you can trust to put more money in your pocket so you and your family can get ahead.As tonight’s debate confirmed, Jagmeet Singh’s NDP and Elizabeth May’s Green Party believe in the same big-spending, high-taxing policies that Justin Trudeau has delivered over the last four years.With Singh, May, and Trudeau – life will only get more expensive and Canadians will have even less money in their pockets.A hard-working father to five great kids, Andrew Scheer understands the struggles families face across the country. That’s why, as Prime Minister, he will: Scrap Trudeau’s carbon taxRemove GST from home-heating billsMake maternity benefits tax-freePut more money in your pocket – for you, for your kids, for your retirement.Create better, higher paying jobs by embracing nation building projects at home, while standing up for Canadian workers on the world stage. 
Trudeau hides:
An empty podium stood where Justin Trudeau should have
been.
Trudeau wants to run on anything but his record and
against anyone but his actual opponents.
That’s why he’s skipping debates and dredging up divisive
wedge issues.
He cannot defend his record of runaway spending, massive
deficits, and higher taxes.
And he will not tell Canadians by how much his carbon tax
will increase and how much it will cost them.
Trudeau was elected on a promise to help the middle class.
Instead, he raised taxes on 80% of middle-class Canadians and brought in a
carbon tax that makes groceries, gas, and home heating more expensive.
You can’t trust Justin Trudeau. He’s not as advertised.
It’s your time:
Over the next 39 days, Justin Trudeau will do anything he
can to avoid scrutiny, and distract from his record.
He will continue to divide Canadians and spread fear and
misinformation.
Andrew Scheer will remain focused on you.
Making your life more affordable.
Putting more money in your pocket.
For you. For your kids. For your retirement.

Yesterday the Conservative Party received
notice from lawyers representing the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
informing us they would be suing over the use of news clips in a Conservative
Party social media video.
The Conservative Party has grave concern that this decision was made on the eve of an election that CBC is to be covering fairly and objectively. The Conservative Party considers this a complete distraction in the final days of a tightly contested election, and we will dispute this lawsuit fully.
The video in question was removed from our platforms well
before CBC lawyers made the decision to file their lawsuit.
The 17 seconds of CBC clips in the video included Andrew
Coyne highlighting how Justin Trudeau broke the law, Justin Trudeau telling a
Canadian war veteran that he is “asking for more than we can give right now”,
and one CBC reporter questioning why the Liberals provided Loblaws with $12
million in tax dollars to install new refrigerators.
CBC is a taxpayer-funded entity, tasked with covering this
election fairly and objectively. Canadians pay the funding CBC receives.
Canadians pay the salaries for those employed at CBC. Simply, Canadians own
CBC.
When you are funded entirely by taxpayer dollars,
taxpayers should be able to use the footage.
The Copyright Act provides for fair dealing.
Elections Canada provided further clarification on a
September 11th posting to their website, namely:
Question 35. Can a political ad contain a “news clip” without the approval of the broadcaster? Answer:  Prior to the election period, broadcasters can decline to run a political ad on any grounds they choose, provided they treat all parties on an equitable basis.  However, during the election period, they are not entitled to decline an ad unless the broadcast would be in contravention of the law.  If a news clip is relatively short and is not a substantial part of the audiovisual work from which it was taken, the broadcast of the news clip in a political ad would not infringe the copyright of the owner of the audiovisual work and would not require the permission of that owner to be broadcast.
Instead, CBC is using taxpayer dollars to sue a major
political party ten days before a national election in this country.

Luc Berthold, Conservative Shadow Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,
released the following statement regarding the recent Chinese import ban of all
Canadian meat products:
 
“Today, media are reporting that the Chinese government will ban the imports of
all Canadian meat, citing food safety concerns. In the last year, Canada
exported almost $374 million worth of pork, beef, and veal meat to China.
 
“Conservatives know that Canadian farmers produce some of the highest quality
meat in the world. Any assertion by the Chinese government to the contrary is
both false and baseless.
 
“It is clear that this is not an issue of food safety, but a political issue
caused by Justin Trudeau’s incompetence and weakness on the world stage. Canada
has already lost Chinese market access for canola, soy, and now meat. And while
this has been taking place, the Trudeau Liberals have failed to take decisive
action and stand up to the Chinese government. This is just another example of
Trudeau’s failed leadership on the world stage.
 
“With the G20 taking place this Friday, Justin Trudeau must personally raise
this issue with President Xi Jinping and demand that he remove these non-tariff
trade barriers.
 
“Conservatives will continue to stand up and support Canada’s agriculture
sector. That is why an Andrew Scheer government will launch a WTO complaint
defending our producers and pull the funding from the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank.”

“Today, on Canadian Multiculturalism Day, Canadians from all across the country celebrate one of the pillars and long-lasting traditions of this country, our cultural and ethnic diversity.
“We owe our beautiful diversity to the great strength of this country, our freedom. Our long, deep, and proud tradition of freedom goes back well before the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, as perhaps seen most powerfully in Canada having been the destination of the Underground Railroad. Our freedom is the reason why so many people from all around the world come to Canada seeking to be free and to become Canadian.
“I am proud to lead the Conservative Party, a party that believes that Canada’s best characteristics are reinforced by the values of new Canadians. In fact, the very first multiculturalism act was passed under a Conservative Government led by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. New Canadians enrich our communities by bringing with them their values of entrepreneurship; sacrifice; risk-taking; individual freedoms; cultural, familial, and faith traditions; and a desire to succeed. All of these inherently conservative principles are shared amongst those who have come to Canada over the course of our history.
“From as early as 1957, Canada’s Conservatives have been proud to represent the country’s cultural breadth in Parliament. The first Chinese Canadian MP, Douglas Jung, was a Conservative, and so was the first black cabinet Minister, Lincoln Alexander; the first Filipino Canadian Senator, the Honourable Tobias Enverga; the first Korean Senator, the Honourable Yonah Martin; the first Vietnamese Senator, the Honourable Thanh Hai Ngo; the first Pakistani Senator, the Honourable Salma Ataullahjan; the first Hindu MP, Deepak Obhrai; the first Japanese MP Bev Oda; the first Inuk appointed to federal cabinet, the Honourable Leona Aglukkaq; and the first turbaned Sikh appointed to federal cabinet, the Honourable Tim Uppal; among many others.
“As we prepare to celebrate Canada Day and what makes us the best country in the world, let’s reflect on our heritage of freedom that has helped to shape our nation and make it so diverse.

Justin Trudeau has repeatedly said that he will not apologize
for the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal, because he was standing up for jobs.

This is not true. Justin Trudeau promised to be honest with Canadians and to do
politics differently, but clearly he is not as advertised.

The Ethics Commissioner clearly articulated that Justin Trudeau inappropriately
put political pressure on the Attorney General in order to suit the political
self-interests of the Liberal Party.

The Ethics Commissioner found that “on at least four separate occasions”
private political interests were raised with Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Jody Wilson-Raybould testified to the Justice Committee that Justin Trudeau
wanted a DPA because “I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.”

Jody Wilson-Raybould testified to the Justice Committee that a senior Trudeau
Liberal staffer said: “if six months from the election SNC announces they’re
moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said, “We can have the
best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.””

It has also been alleged that a number of senior Trudeau Liberals repeatedly
raised the prospect of the 2018 Quebec provincial election.

The Ethics Commissioner asked Bill Morneau whether he had done any sort of
study or analysis into SNC-Lavalin failing to secure an agreement, and he said
no.

The then CEO of SNC-Lavalin has said he never brought up potential job losses as a
result of failing to secure an agreement with the Prime Minister.

One of Justin Trudeau’s first orders of business after becoming Prime Minister
was to try and cancel a shipbuilding contract with Davie. Davie has said that 400 Quebec jobs were on the line if the
project was delayed.

Immediately withdraw Canada from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.Immediately launch a complaint at the World Trade Organization.Increase inspections on all Chinese imports.Start examining possible retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports that will have the greatest possible impact while minimizing harm to Canadian consumers.
The letter goes on to say:   “I strongly urge you to ignore the advice from senior Liberals, like Jean Chretien and John McCallum, who have suggested we flout the rule of law and give in to the Chinese government’s demands to free Meng Wanzhou. Your actions during the SNC-Lavalin scandal already shook Canadians’ confidence in the justice system to the core.    The only option here is to show strength and finally stand up for Canada.

Trudeau is campaigning with two planes, emitting more than double the amount of other campaigns
Despite marching in climate strikes,
lecturing everybody else on lowering emissions, and imposing a carbon tax on
hard-working Canadians, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are secretly using two
aircraft to campaign in this election.
Conservatives have confirmed that Trudeau’s official
Boeing 737-800 campaign planes (his official branded plane and two
replacements) have been travelling with a second aircraft – a 40-year-old
Boeing 737-200 with tail number C-GNLE.
His official branded plane – tail number C-GTQB – and the second plane were spotted on the tarmac together at Pearson Airport in Toronto yesterday:



Flight records show his three official planes have been accompanied by the second plane throughout the campaign:

Not only is Trudeau running with two
aircraft, his second plane is by far the highest-emitting aircraft in the
campaign. The Boeing 737-200 burns through a staggering 975 gallons of jet fuel
an hour. His official branded plane burns between 800
and 850 gallons an hour.
By comparison, Jagmeet Singh’s NDP plane burns 795 gallons an hour and
Andrew Scheer’s Conservative plane burns 640
gallons an hour.
That means Trudeau’s campaign is emitting nearly three times as

“Canadians are tired of being lectured to and taxed by a

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Ottawa, ON
– Kelly Block, Conservative Shadow Minister for Transport, and Shannon Stubbs,
Conservative Shadow Minister for Natural Resources, released a statement
following the vote on Bill C-48 in the Senate:
 
“Conservatives disagree in the strongest terms with the decision by the Senate
to rescue Justin Trudeau’s plan to land-lock Canadian oil and gas. This
legislation is a slap in the face to out-of-work, under-employed and struggling
energy workers from coast to coast.
 
“This bill is not an environment bill – it is a big part of Justin Trudeau’s
plan to “phase-out” Canada’s oilsands. That is why a future Conservative
government will repeal this bill when we form government.
 
“Despite stark warnings from workers, experts and Premiers about the
devastating impact this bill will have on the entire Canadian economy, the
Liberals and their allies in the Senate are forging ahead with this disastrous
legislation. Conservatives have opposed this divisive and job killing
legislation from day one.
 
“The world needs more Canadian energy. If Canada cannot export oil and gas,
then countries like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Russia with lower human rights
and environmental protections will supply the growing international demand.
Developing Canada’s ethically and environmentally sustainably produced oil and
gas is good for the planet and good for Canadian workers”
 
“While Justin Trudeau is dividing Canadians, killing pipeline projects and
forcing Canadians to pay his job killing carbon tax, Andrew Scheer has a plan
to unite Canadians, get Canada’s energy sector back to work, and help all
Canadians get ahead.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Erin O’Toole, Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, and James Bezan, Shadow Minister for National Defence, issued a statement today calling on Justin Trudeau to commit support for Ukraine as Canada co-hosts the 2019 Ukraine Reform Conference:
“Canada’s role in the world has diminished under the Trudeau Liberals as a result of diplomatic missteps and poor judgment. While the previous Conservative government was a world leader in its support for Ukraine, the Trudeau Liberals are seen to hesitate before standing with their allies.
“As Ukraine’s sovereignty continues to be threatened, Conservatives believe that our duty to support and stand with our Ukrainian friends should not diminish with time. Justin Trudeau must finally step up and take immediate action by doing the following:
Supply the Ukrainian military with lethal defensive equipment;
Restore the practice of providing RADARSAT-2 Imagery to the Ukrainian military;
Expand sanctions to hold additional corrupt foreign officials accountable using the Magnitsky legislation, and ensure current sanctions are enforced;
Advocate for the release of political prisoners, including the Ukrainian sailors illegally captured while transiting the Kerch Strait;
Provide additional humanitarian assistance to support the 800,000 internally displaced people in Ukraine.
“As our country welcomes the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and with Canadians watching, now is the time for Justin Trudeau to act. The defence of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity should be a priority for Canada on the world stage.
“Conservatives will continue to demand that Justin Trudeau commit to supporting our ally in the face of ongoing Russian aggression. And a Conservative government under Andrew Scheer will advocate for, and lead, a peacekeeping mission along the Ukraine-Russia border. We will always side with those who value freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives, issued the following statement on the Mid-Autumn Festival:
“Tonight, we join Canadians of Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese descent as they prepare to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.
“Communities across Canada will gather under the full moon to light beautiful lanterns, sing songs and share traditional foods, including moon cakes, which are only baked for this special occasion. Based upon the lunar calendar and dating back centuries, the Mid-Autumn Festival is customarily celebrated when the moon is roundest and brightest to express thankfulness for the bountiful harvest.  
“We are blessed to live in Canada, the best country in the world. There are many reasons why Canada is home to large Asian communities who contribute greatly to our country. It is because we are free – free to worship and free to speak and free to believe. It is because of our economic freedom that produces so much prosperity and opportunity. It is because we are equal – equal in opportunity and equal before the law. It is because we are all these things that we are diverse. Diversity is the result of our strength, and our strength is and always has been our freedom.
“My commitment is to help build a Canada where the dreams you have for yourselves and your children and grandchildren are within your reach. So that each generation can not only succeed, but take care of those who have gone before them.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to all those celebrating a Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!”

And Trudeau himself waged a sustained campaign of misinformation, deceit, and manipulation to cover up the truth from Canadians.   “Next week, the House of Commons Ethics Committee will meet to decide whether or not to further investigative these new revelations.  It will be up to the Liberal majority on this committee to decide if an investigation will take place.   “Today I am calling on the six Liberal members of the Ethics Committee to do the right thing and allow this investigation to proceed. So to MPs Frank Baylis, Mona Fortier, Michel Picard, Raj Saini, Anita Vandenbeld, and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, I say this:   “Your leader has betrayed your trust. He has told falsehoods to you and to this country. This Wednesday, you have a choice to make. You can be complicit in this cover-up and stand by a leader who has deceived Canadians. Or you can put Canada first and shine a light on the truth. Your first duty is not to the Liberal Party, it is to Canadians.   “A Prime Minister who so willingly deceives and breaks the law simply can’t be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of that office.   “Starting today, I am launching a grassroots campaign to encourage Canadians to urge these six Liberal Members of Parliament to put their country before their party and to vote to let the Ethics Committee do its work. We will be communicating directly with Canadians to get them to contact these MPs.   “In 2015, Justin Trudeau promised he would be ethical and accountable. And every day since then, he has proven that he is not as advertised. Time and time again, he has abused the power of his office to reward his supporters and punish his critics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Regina, SK – The Honourable Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, released the following statement today outlining his expectations of Justin Trudeau at the G20 Summit in Japan:
“Justin Trudeau’s poor judgment on the world stage and weak approach to China have resulted in serious and in some cases dire consequences for Canadians. He must seize this weekend’s G20 Summit as an opportunity to correct these failures.
“The Chinese government has detained two Canadian citizens for more than six months while dozens of other Canadians have been detained on administrative grounds or had their visas questioned.
“Canada has lost Chinese market access for meat, canola seed, and soy exports, costing our farmers more than $1 billion to date. We can only expect this cost to increase and the situation to worsen over the summer, and into the fall. The issue at hand is not Canada’s high-quality products. Rather, it is Justin Trudeau’s failure to take decisive action and deal with the threats posed by China.
“Each time China has taken these actions, Trudeau has failed to stand up for Canada. Like Donald Trump during NAFTA negotiations, China has learned it can walk all over Canada, without consequence, with Trudeau in charge. That has to end now.
“Trudeau must personally raise these issues with President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit. He must secure the release of Canadian detainees, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. And he must restore market access for Canadian farmers. Anything less would be yet another failure.
“Canadians expect their Prime Minister to defend Canada’s interests whenever they come under attack. It’s time for Trudeau to finally rise to the occasion and get results.
“As Prime Minister, I will stand up for Canada by pulling funding from the Asian Infrastructure Bank. Trudeau should never have sent Canadian tax dollars there in the first place. His decision to continue financing it is an example of his weakness and poor judgment on the world stage.”-30-

“Mabuhay!
“Today, we join the Filipino-Canadian community and Filipinos around the world to celebrate the historic 121st anniversary of the Declaration of Philippine Independence.
“Today marks the maturing of a free nation, built and preserved by courageous men and women who have devoted their lives to promoting a democratic and free country.
“It was under the previous Conservative government that Canada received more immigrants from the Philippines than from anywhere else in the world. As one of the fastest growing communities, over 700,000 determined and passionate Filipino-Canadians proudly call Canada their home. Canadians of Filipino heritage are resilient, hard-working citizens who are students, artists, business owners, and leaders within our communities.
“It was also in 2012, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed the late Senator Tobias Enverga Jr to become Canada’s first senator of Filipino descent. Senator Enverga was a role model and leader within the Filipino community, serving in the Upper Chamber with dedication, integrity and determination. He was known for fiercely advocating for persons with disabilities and was a tireless champion of the inherent dignity and sanctity of human life.
“Our shared values are the cornerstone of the relationship between Canada and the Philippines, and our mutual commitment to international and economic development has strengthened that bond. Canada is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law, and fundamental and universal human rights. We absolutely must protect these values – because they are what set us apart. They allow Canada to offer what so many other countries simply cannot: The freedom to preserve and pass on our cultural traditions and the opportunity to live in peace with those around us.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I wish all those celebrating, a Happy Philippines Independence Day!

Liberals misrepresenting Conservative plan to support infrastructure
Justin Trudeau is lying and misrepresenting the Conservative plan to support infrastructure projects across Canada. Let’s look at the facts. Public policy expert Jack Mintz confirmed that the Conservative plan only “delays” infrastructure spending by three years. He also confirmed that these delays only impact “uncommitted infrastructure spending”.  In contrast, the Liberals cut up to 40% of infrastructure spending from 2016-2017.  The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) agrees. The PBO confirms that the Conservative plan will extend “spending for the Investing in Canada Plan (ICP) over an eleven-year period, rather than the eight-year period.” The PBO also says that the Conservative plan would “spread the same nominal amount of money over a longer period of time”. The PBO also confirmed that our plan continues “funding obligations already committed to by the Government”.  Justin Trudeau is lying to Canadians. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives will maintain infrastructure spending. Instead we will cut corporate welfare and foreign aid to relatively wealthy countries in order to lower taxes and help you get ahead. https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/ElectionProposalCosting/Results/33020559_EN.pdf?timestamp=1570992945242 https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/Reports/2019/Main_estimates_2019_20/The%20Government%E2%80%99s%20Expenditure%20Plan%20and%20Main%20Estimates%20for%202019-20_EN.pdf.pdf

Conservative foreign policy will cut aid spending by 25% and put it back in the pockets of Canadian families
Today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer detailed
his plan for delivering strong Conservative leadership on the world stage.
On the same day the Munk debate on foreign policy
was supposed to take place before Justin Trudeau forced its cancellation, Scheer
shared details around four key pillars of his foreign policy plan which
include:
Cutting 25% of foreign
aid spending – The reduction will come from middle- and upper-income countries
as well as hostile regimes. We will use the savings to pay for policies that
help Canadians get ahead at home and also redirect
$700 million to strengthen foreign aid in the countries that need it most. We
will continue to work in partnership with leading Canadian aid organizations
including volunteer-focused groups who provide much-needed assistance to
developing countries.
Strengthening
Canada’s commitment to traditional alliances and providing additional military
and non-military support to Ukraine.
Advocating for human
rights on the world stage by using Canada’s Magnitsky legislation to target
hostile regimes like Iran.
Depoliticizing
military procurement in order to properly and expediently supply the Canadian
Armed Forces.
“Justin Trudeau has spent the last four years
humiliating himself and all Canadians on the world stage with his weak,
unprincipled leadership,” Scheer said. “Canadians deserve a Prime Minister that
will once again make them proud and who will always stand up for Canada’s
interests in an increasingly hostile world.”
Scheer highlighted the long and growing list of
scandals and humiliations that have harmed Canada’s reputation during Justin
Trudeau’s time in power, including his admiration for China’s “basic
dictatorship,” his praise for Cuban communist dictator Fidel Castro, his disastrous
India trip, and his disgraceful Omar Khadr settlement.
On foreign aid, Scheer said his plan will refocus Canadian
help where it is most needed while helping more Canadians get ahead at home.
“At a time when Canadians are working harder than
ever and not getting ahead, Trudeau is using their hard-earned tax dollars to
support antisemitic organizations and prop up foreign dictatorships,” Scheer
concluded. “Our plan will take Canadian tax dollars away from corrupt dictators
and wealthy countries and return it to Canadians so they can get ahead.
“At the same time, we will continue to consider aid proposals
which support non-development objectives such as minority rights and peaceful
coexistence taking place in any country,” Scheer said.

New transnational project to generate economic and social benefits across the country
A new Conservative government will create a national corridor to carry Canadian energy and resources from coast to coast, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“It’s time for a government that understands we’re in this together,
that Canada works better when we work together,” Scheer said. “A new National
Energy Corridor will create jobs and opportunities while uniting Canadians in
our shared potential and prosperity.” 
A National Energy Corridor will generate
economic and social benefits for the entire country by moving oil, gas,
hydroelectricity, telecommunications, and potentially accommodating other
linear infrastructure. With a single corridor, industry wouldn’t need to submit
complicated proposals for every new project.
A single coast-to-coast corridor would:
minimize environmental impactslower the costs of environmental assessments without sacrificing qualityincrease certainty for investorsget critical projects builtand create good-paying jobs. 
A new Conservative government will appoint a
blue-ribbon task force to provide recommendations within six months of its
establishment on how to proceed. The government would then begin to work with the
provinces and Indigenous peoples – who would both share in the prosperity this
project would provide – to realize this vital coast-to-coast link. 
“As
Canadians, we need to start dreaming big again, and we need to start dreaming
together,” said Scheer. “We need to start building a stronger, more united
country worthy of those who came before us and that our children and
grandchildren deserve.” 
Today’s announcement is part of Andrew
Scheer’s plan to create jobs for Canadians across the country and help you get
ahead.  
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving a couple earning average salaries $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit,      allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and      learning programs. Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest      income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax      Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians for green home improvements.

Ottawa, ON
– Luc Berthold, Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Agri-food, and Dean
Allison, Shadow Minister for International Trade Diversification, today
sent a letter to the Agriculture Minister and the Trade Minister calling on the
Liberals to update Canadians on the actions they have taken to resolve the
Chinese government’s ban on Canadian meat.

“The original ban by the Chinese government of these Canadian products was
reportedly due to counterfeit Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) export
certificates,” said MP Berthold. “It is our expectation that the CFIA has put
in place adequate safeguards to assure the Chinese government that this will
not occur again.”

Some commodities, like Canadian soy, have not shipped a single vessel since
December. Canadians need to be updated on the status of this ban and know if
Canada’s meat products will face a ban similar to canola and soy.

“Canada’s agriculture industry depends on stable trade relationships. This
stability allows our farmers and producers to plan appropriately and ensure
success. Unfortunately, under this government this has not been the case,” said
MP Allison. “The trade barriers currently in place for our agriculture sector
will have long-term negative effects not only on our farmers and producers, but
the Canadian economy as a whole.”

The Trudeau Liberals must answer these simple questions: 
Has
     the CFIA addressed the problem of counterfeit export certificates to the
     satisfaction of the Chinese government? If not, when will this happen?How
     much money is this trade barrier with the Chinese government costing
     Canada’s pork and beef sectors?

Trudeau calls on Québecers to fight Ontario and Alberta
Today during a press conference, Justin Trudeau called on Québecers to fight Albertans and Ontarians. Here is what Trudeau said: “[Q]uébecers need to stand up and fight against those like Jason Kenney and Doug Ford and other conservative politicians.” But here is what Trudeau said just yesterday: “Everything I tried to do in the last four years has been focused on bringing the country together. Yet we find ourselves now in a more polarized, more divisive election than even the 2015 one.” Justin Trudeau disparages the 19 million Canadians these leaders represent. He is a hypocrite and cannot be trusted to unite Canadians. Trudeau is simply not as advertised. Regardless of our differences, or our political views, politicians should never pit Canadians against one another. Trudeau’s comment today is unbecoming of an individual who aspires to be Prime Minister, and whose job it is to unite Canadians. This is just another example of how Justin Trudeau will do and say anything to get re-elected, even turn Canadians against each other for his own political gain. Andrew Scheer is a consensus builder, he has run a positive campaign focused on what leaders across provinces and cities can accomplish together, regardless of party affiliation. The Conservative Party is the party of nation building and on October 22nd, we will start to repair the damage Justin Trudeau has done to our federation.

When Justin Trudeau was asked about small actions his family has taken to reduce plastic waste in their household, this is what he had to say:
“Uh, we, uh, we have recently switched to drinking, uh, water bottles out of, uh, water out of, uh, when we have water bottles, uh, out of plastic, uh, sorry, away from plastic towards, uh, paper, um, like drink box water bottles sort of things.”
Syntax aside, here are the facts about Trudeau’s “drink box water bottle sort of things”:
“Drink box water bottle sort of things” are way more expensive than normal bottled water: A 24 pack of Boxed Water is Better sells online for $44.96 USD. By comparison, a 24 pack of Nestle is currently on-sale for $2.50 CAD at Loblaws.
But, nothing is cheaper than good old-fashioned tap water! At the price of a 24 pack of Boxed Water is Better, the Trudeau family could easily afford a top of the line Brita filter.
“Drink box water bottle sort of things” are actually less environmentally friendly than plastic water bottles: According to the Alberta Bottle Depot Association, boxed water containers are less recyclable than plastic water bottles, and that consumers are more likely to recycle plastic water bottles than boxed water containers.
Trudeau hasn’t entirely switched to “drink box water bottle sort of things”: Just like how the Trudeau Liberals jet-set around the world to photo opportunities at international conferences, while at the same time lecturing families using a car to commute to and from work, it appears Justin Trudeau’s environmentalism is Not as Advertised.

conservative,https://www.conservative.ca/unanswered-questions-in-the-snc-lavalin-corruption-scandal/,"
 
Justin Trudeau’s SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal was a sad chapter in our
country’s history. The Prime Minister of Canada was found to have broken ethics
laws in order to try and get his corporate friends out of criminal corruption
charges.
 
The Ethics Commissioner provided many new details for Canadians concerned about
this corruption scandal, but there are now even more outstanding questions and
Canadians deserve answers.
 
Justin Trudeau promised to do politics differently. He promised to be open,
transparent, and honest, but throughout this corruption scandal he has proven
time and time again to be not as advertised. He has stonewalled the Ethics
Commissioner, shut-down committee investigations, and silenced Jody
Wilson-Raybould.
 
This week, Canada’s Conservatives have recalled the Ethics
Committee in the search of answers. Let’s hope the Liberal members on the
committee do the right-thing, put the interests of our country ahead of the
Liberal Party, and allow the committee to look into the matter.
 
Here are a few of the outstanding questions in Justin Trudeau’s SNC-Lavalin
corruption scandal:

1) On April 3, 2019, Justin Trudeau said “we put forward an unprecedented
waiver that suspended solicitor client privilege in this matter, that suspended
cabinet confidentiality so (Jody Wilson-Raybould) could speak fully to this
matter.” Yet the Ethics Commissioner found that 9 people were being gagged by
Justin Trudeau and were unable to talk. Why is he continuing the cover-up?
 
2) In a letter dated June 13, 2019, Justin Trudeau’s deputy minister sent a
letter to the Ethics Commissioner declining to provide additional
information.  Did Justin Trudeau or his close advisors instruct another
public servant to do his political dirty work? 
3) The Table
of Public Statutes identifies the Minister of Justice as the responsible
Minister for the sections of the Criminal
Code related to remediation agreements. The Ethics
Commissioner revealed that Jody Wilson-Raybould did not sign the Memorandum to
Cabinet authorizing this legislative change.  Who did? 
4) Why did
Justin Trudeau say after his September 17th meeting with Jody
Wilson-Raybould that she was open to revisiting her position on interfering in
an ongoing criminal trial? 
5) Why did
Scott Brison attempt to exert influence over Jody Wilson-Raybould to interfere
in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin? 
6) Why did
Scott Brison send SNC-Lavalin’s legal strategy to senior advisors to Justin
Trudeau two weeks after SNC-Lavalin launched a judicial review of the Director
of Public Prosecutions’ decision to not negotiate a deferred prosecution
agreement? 
7) Why did
senior advisors to Justin Trudeau brief SNC-Lavalin that Gerald Butts would
advocate for their issues with Jody Wilson-Raybould as the two of them met at
the Chateau Laurier? 
8) Why did
Gerald Butts tell Jody Wilson-Raybould’s Chief of Staff that “the government
had set up the remediation agreement regime to allow SNC-Lavalin to benefit
from the tool”. 
9) Does
Justin Trudeau agree with his legal counsel that he is not “vicariously liable”
for the actions of his staff?  How does this equate to “taking full
responsibility”? 
10) In the Trudeau II Report, the
Ethics Commissioner writes “Mr. Trudeau’s legal counsel also wrote that Ms.
Wilson-Raybould’s anger at being moved from the office of the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General coloured her perception of prior events…Ms.
Wilson-Raybould failed in her duty, as Attorney General, to acquaint herself
with all the relevant facts.  Rather than making a meaningful, independent
decision of her own, Ms. Wilson-Raybould reflexively deferred to the Director
of Public Prosecutions’ decision.”  Does Justin Trudeau agree with his
legal counsel’s apparent assessment that Jody Wilson-Raybould was emotional and
couldn’t be reasoned with?

SEPTEMBER 29, 2019
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“This evening, at sundown,
the Jewish communities in Canada and around the world prepare to mark Rosh Hashanah
– the New Year- and the beginning of the High Holy Days.
“Rosh Hashanah is celebrated
on the first two days of the month of Tishrei, and marks the beginning of the
ten days of repentance during which Jews around the world will reflect on their
actions over the past year and seek forgiveness.
“As friends and families
share meals with sweet challah and apple slices dipped in honey, they will
reflect on renewal, and hope for an abundant year ahead.
“Canada has been blessed by
the strong presence of the Canadian Jewish community who enrich our country’s
culture and values of pluralism and freedom. As the Jewish community remains a
targeted group for hate-related offences, this Rosh Hashanah, let us recommit
ourselves to combating all forms of antisemitism and work together to educate
and to better our country.
“On behalf of the Canada’s
Conservatives, I extend my best wishes to the Jewish community, across Canada
and around the world, celebrating Rosh Hashanah and hope for a peaceful and
prosperous year ahead.
“L’Shanah Tovah Tikatevu
V’Tichatemu.”

With Gerald Butts back in Justin Trudeau’s inner circle, the Prime Minister can no longer run and hide from lingering questions regarding the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.   Gerald Butts was the enforcer behind the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal. Butts misled Canadians during his testimony to the Justice Committee, bullied former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, and oversaw the Trudeau government’s scheme to interfere in the criminal trial of the Liberal-connected corporation.  Meanwhile, Jody Wilson-Raybould was booted from the Liberal Party for speaking truth to power.   Justin Trudeau puts blind loyalty over ethical behavior. Questions about his corruption scandal remain:    1. Why did Gerald Butts resign from the Prime Minister’s Office? Did he receive any severance? If so, how much? Was he in contact with the PM, PMO or government officials while he was “outside”?  2. What did Jane Philpott mean when she said “I’m not sure that the whole story will ever come out. It is really complex — links between various officials both elected and unelected. Links here are pretty deep. There are things that I heard that won’t come out because of cabinet confidentiality”?  3. Why did the PM refuse to allow any figure bound by cabinet confidence (JWR, Philpott, Butts, Wernick) to speak about any events that occurred after January 14th, 2019?   4. Have assurances been made to SNC-Lavalin that they will receive a deferred prosecution agreement before the election?   In her submission to the Justice Committee, Jody Wilson-Raybould wrote “I did make another decision at this time – that I would immediately resign if the new Attorney General decided to issue a directive in the SNC-Lavalin matter.”  Was this why JWR resigned as Veterans Affairs Minister?   5. When the PM fired Jody Wilson-Raybould for the first time on January 7th, 2019, Butts’ notes recorded the PM telling her “after an election, everything is fresh again.”  What did that mean?   6. On February 11th, just before the resignation, Butts was with Trudeau in Vancouver. What happened in that meeting?   7. On four occasions, Michael Wernick said that the PM was “in a firm mood” or “in a mood” about the deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin.  What did that mean?   8. Why did Gerald Butts tell the Justice Committee that “there was no urgency” to his request for JWR’s Chief of Staff to meet with him, when his assistant had sent an email summoning the former Chief of Staff to a meeting at 4:14 PM on December 18th labelled urgent?   9. What firms have been retained, at taxpayer expense, to represent the PM, PMO or others in the SNC-Lavalin Affair and what has the cost been to taxpayers?

Today, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, issued the following statement on the start of Gender Equality Week:
Gender equality benefits all of us. When everyone has a fair and equal chance to succeed, we all do better – whether it’s building peace, fighting the climate crisis, or growing economies that work for everyone. We all have a role to play to make that a reality, and Gender Equality Week is a chance to move forward.
Just this past week, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will create hundreds of thousands of new before and after school care spaces, nearly double federal spending on child care, and move forward to deliver guaranteed paid family leave for every new parent in Canada. Because child care still falls disproportionately to women, these measures represent an important step forward for gender equality and will make a difference for families across Canada.
Our Liberal government has put gender equality at the heart of our work since day one. Over the last four years, we took historic steps to advance the rights of women, girls, and people of all gender identities. We passed unprecedented pay equity legislation, and legislation that added gender identity and expression as a protected ground in the Canada Human Rights Act. We took action to promote women’s leadership on boards and in the C-suite, and boosted support for women entrepreneurs with a plan to double the number of women entrepreneurs by 2025. We also created the first ever federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence, and with our National Housing Strategy, we’ve created more than 7,000 shelter spaces for survivors of family violence, and are making sure women, their families and their kids have access to safe, affordable housing.
Beyond our borders, we launched Canada’s first Feminist International Assistance Policy, which puts the empowerment, education, and health of women and girls at the centre of all our development assistance. We created the first ever Gender Equality Advisory Council to the G7 – and thanks to their leadership, we delivered a historic investment in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations. This summer, we also announced an unprecedented investment to protect the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls everywhere, including universal access to family planning, contraception, comprehensive sexuality education, and access to safe and legal abortion and post-abortion care. Canada also co-chaired the Equal Rights Coalition, the first intergovernmental network formed to promote and protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people around the world.
But there is still so much more to do. Women’s rights and gender equality are under attack around the world, from the legitimization of gender-based violence, to the assault on a woman’s right to choose. Trans women, Indigenous women, racialized women, women with disabilities, low-income women, migrant and refugee women, and people of diverse gender identities still face unequal, unacceptable barriers. That has to change.
We’re going to take up that work, just as we’ve done so far. Even in Canada, while some politicians are intent on rolling back rights and cutting access to important services like health care and sexual assault centres, Gender Equality Week reminds us that we have the choice to keep moving forward. Let’s stand united, work together, and build a more equal Canada, and a better world for everyone.

Outremont, QC- Local Liberals in Outremont have nominated Rachel Bendayan, a devoted community leader, as the official Team Trudeau candidate in the upcoming federal by-election.
“We are very proud to welcome Rachel Bendayan to Team Trudeau for this important by-election in Outremont,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “No one understands the needs, hopes, and challenges of Outremont families and small businesses like Rachel, and I know that she will never stop working hard to make life better for everyone in her community.”

OTTAWA, ON – Just minutes after Faith Goldy was banned by Facebook and Instagram for “spreading hate,” Faith Goldy urgently went online to encourage supporters to “go run sign up for your EDAs go make sure that our guys win within your various ridings.” (https://youtu.be/Kv7c73xN_7s?t=2706, Faith Goldy, YouTube, April 8, 2019)
EDAs (Electoral District Associations) are the local associations of members of a political party.
“Faith Goldy has been a long-time booster of Andrew Scheer, so it’s deeply troubling that after getting banned by Facebook, she is encouraging her supporters to infiltrate a political Party,” said Omar Alghabra, Liberal MP for Mississauga Centre. “I’m calling on Andrew Scheer to clearly state that he won’t tolerate anyone like Faith Goldy, or those who spread hate, in the Conservative Party.
“Canadians applauded Facebook’s decision to ban hate promoters. It’s high time that Andrew Scheer followed their example and addressed the lingering questions around his tolerance for such groups and individuals. Mr. Scheer needs to disavow and denounce Ms. Goldy and white supremacist groups without equivocation,” said Alghabra, while pointing to the numerous connections between Andrew Scheer and Faith Goldy.

Scheer and Faith Goldy spoke at the same rally on Parliament Hill in February (https://leaderpost.com/news/national/faith-goldy-five-others-banned-from-facebook-instagram-over-hate/wcm/94053542-fd47-40af-9fe5-ee287e57450b)
Faith Goldy attended and endorsed Scheer at his Leadership convention:”Andrew Scheer is a 38 year old man. He’s younger, he’s hipper, he’s fresher than the Prime Minister that we now have. And frankly, he’s much more authentic. And if the mainstream media has a problem with the so-con wing of the party, tough luck guys!” (https://youtu.be/1bmrhFHT3kM?t=142)
Scheer appeared on Faith Goldy’s YouTube channel when he was running for Conservative Leader, and promised to go duck hunting with her (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-JVPbMj_V4)
Scheer’s Campaign Manager co-founded Rebel Media, which employed Faith Goldy.

“If Andrew Scheer doesn’t clearly disavow and denounce Faith Goldy, we can only assume he’s accepting her support for the Conservative Party.”

Andrew Scheer
Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada
1720-130 Albert St
Ottawa, ON
K1P 5G4
Dear Mr. Scheer,
Today, Ontario’s Francophones are celebrating more than 400 years of outstanding contributions to the cultural, social, economic and political life of our country.
Unfortunately, this contribution is under threat from the draconian cuts Doug Ford’s government has made to services for the Franco-Ontarian community.
The Liberal Party of Canada is a proud defender of official languages and will continue to stand united with Franco-Ontarians in protecting their linguistic rights. Our record includes, amongst other things:

The Action Plan for Official Languages 2018-2023 which includes a historic $2.7 billion investment;
A $675 million funding increase to the CBC/Radio-Canada;
Reinstatement and modernization of the Court Challenges Program;
Reinstatement of the long-form census;
Nomination of bilingual judges to the Supreme Court of Canada;
Prioritizing francophone immigration to Canada with the launch of a Francophone Immigration Strategy;
Commitment to modernize the Official Languages Act.

We regrettably note you have never had the courage to denounce Doug Ford’s direct attacks on the Franco-Ontarian community. By siding with Doug Ford, you have failed Francophones across the country.
Today, we call on you to once and for all denounce your friend Doug Ford’s deep cuts and that you commit to maintaining the funding we have put into place to support linguistic minorities.
In addition to denouncing Mr. Ford’s cuts, we call on you to explain to Canadians which services you plan to cut in order to balance the budget. Franco-Ontarians have every reason to fear the worst and that you will follow the same approach as Doug Ford: pretend you’re for the people during the election, then once elected, cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everyone else – and in this case, it is services for Francophones that will suffer.

The Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement for Women’s History Month:
“During Women’s History Month, we celebrate the achievements of women and girls throughout our history and recognize the trailblazing women who have shaped our country.
From one generation to the next, women have built the Canada we know today – but their accomplishments have often gone unrecognized. Gender equality advocates have long led efforts to change that. This year’s theme, ‘Make An Impact,’ encourages us to celebrate their work, and spotlight women everywhere who are breaking glass ceilings and transforming our world for the better.
Over the last four years, our Liberal government has followed their lead. We’re helping more people learn about women leaders throughout our history, with initiatives like making Viola Desmond the face of the $10 bill – and we’re providing more support for the community organizations that are leading the fight for gender equality. Whether it’s launching the first ever federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence, or investing to double the number of women entrepreneurs by 2025, we’ve made progress to protect women’s rights and make sure people of all gender identities have a fair and equal chance to succeed. We’ve taken up this work beyond our borders, too – from our Feminist International Assistance Policy, to major investments in sexual and reproductive health rights, and in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations.
We’ve put gender equality at the heart of our work since day one – and we’ll continue to do so. Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will create hundreds of thousands of new before and after school care spaces, nearly double federal spending on child care, and move forward to deliver guaranteed paid family leave for every new parent in Canada. Because child care still falls disproportionately to women, these measures represent an important step forward for gender equality and will make a difference for families across Canada.
We know there is much more to do to make sure women’s contributions are valued, their voices are heard, and their rights are respected – especially for the most vulnerable women. Trans women, Indigenous women, racialized women, women with disabilities, low-income women, migrant and refugee women, and people of diverse gender identities still face unequal, unacceptable obstacles – and many activists from these groups are leading the fight to change that. Their work is part of a long history of women breaking down barriers – and building a better Canada.
In 2019, we’ve seen an attack on women’s rights around the world, from the legitimization of gender-based violence, to the assault on a woman’s right to choose. Even in Canada, some politicians are intent on rolling back rights and cutting access to important services like health care and sexual assault centres. Women’s History Month reminds us that we can’t lose ground on gender equality – and we need to stand with those who are fighting for it. Today, and every day, let’s come together for a more equal world, and choose forward, for all of us.”

TORONTO, ON – Following last week’s news that Canadians have created more than one million new jobs since 2015, Liberal M.P. Marco Mendicino highlighted the risk that Andrew Scheer’s reckless cuts would pose to the economy and our middle class.
“Andrew Scheer wants to make reckless cuts that would cripple our economy and put middle class jobs at risk. To fulfill his promises, Andrew Scheer would make drastic and reckless cuts to programs and services that millions of middle class Canadians rely on – while at the same time promising tax cuts for the wealthiest Canadians,” says Liberal M.P. Marco Mendicino. “We know that this is what Conservative politicians do. Making cuts to programs and services that middle class Canadian families rely on is all too familiar to the people of Ontario who have watched Doug Ford make cuts to schools, libraries, public health agencies, and francophone services. This would cost jobs and hurt the economy.”
Today, Canada’s economy is strong and growing, with record-low unemployment and poverty levels and more than a million new jobs created since late 2015. That record of economic success, and Canada’s solid reputation as a good place to invest and do business, would be at risk under Andrew Scheer’s short-sighted economic “vision,” including a tax break for wealthy Canadians who send their children to private schools (anticipated cost: $1.7 billion) and putting U.S. missiles on Canadian soil (anticipated cost: $10.8 billion over five years on military spending.)
And let’s not forget that Andrew Scheer’s signature foreign policy idea is supporting Britain’s exit from Europe, which has seen an economic catastrophe.
Andrew Scheer won’t let the Parliamentary Budget Officer do an independent costing of his platform. But we know that his spending promises come with a hefty price tag, which means that Andrew Scheer would have to make $55 billion in cuts to fulfill his promises. To keep his promise, Andrew Scheer would have to make reckless cuts to programs and services that help middle class Canadians like:

Investments to assist low income seniors
Lowering interest rates on student loans
The Canada Workers Benefit
The Housing Affordability Plan
The plan to move forward on Pharmacare
Access to high-speed internet for all Canadians

“Andrew Scheer has no credible plan to grow the economy and help the middle class,” said Marco Mendicino. “He can’t balance the budget without making cuts, and austerity through cuts doesn’t help Canadians. Ontarians know what it’s like to be told that there will be no cuts only to find out after the election that that promise wasn’t true. Canadians deserve better.”

Trois-Rivières, QC — A re-elected Liberal government will make it easier and more affordable for hard-working Canadians to start and grow their own businesses.
Right now, seven out of every ten Canadians work for small and medium-sized businesses — making them Canada’s largest employers and drivers of our economy. Yet for too many entrepreneurs, the costs of doing business is a barrier.
“After a decade of stalled economic growth and unemployment under the Conservatives, Canada’s economy has rebounded — largely thanks to the hard work of Canadians who started their own businesses,” said Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “To keep that momentum moving forward, we cut the small business tax rate and now we’re making it possible for anyone with a good idea and a passion for what they do to start their own business and support their communities.”
In addition to cutting the small business tax rate from 11 per cent to 9 per cent, a re-elected Liberal government will remove barriers to success by cutting fees, reducing red tape, and creating funds for new business owners to find support. We will also:

provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs a year with as much as $50,000 to launch a new business;
give $250 to every new business looking to expand their online services;
eliminate all fees from the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), Export Development Canada (EDC), and Farm Credit Canada, for business advisory services like mentorship and training;
cut the cost of federal incorporation by 75 per cent; and
eliminate the “swipe fee” on HST and GST for credit transactions — which will save businesses nearly $500 million a year in fees, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

These measures build on four years of strong Liberal support for small- and medium-sized businesses in Canada, including:

cutting the small business tax rate to nine per cent — the lowest rate in the G7 — which saves businesses as much as $7,500 per year;
allowing businesses to write-off job creating investments;
making regulations smarter and eliminating unnecessary and outdated regulations; and
opening up new markets for businesses by introducing the Export Diversification Strategy.

“More support for the wealthiest one percent won’t help the average Canadian get ahead,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Only Liberals have a plan to keep moving forward and give everyone a chance to succeed.”

2019 French-language Leaders’ Debate
Once again, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau clearly demonstrated the choice Canadians have to make on October 21: keep moving forward with the progress achieved over the past four years, or go back to the politics of the Harper years. Here is what some people are saying about tonight’s debate:
Quotations are included in their original language
« L’attaque de Justin Trudeau fait mouche : « Vous étiez tous les deux avec Harper », dit-il à Bernier et Scheer qui s’inquiètent du déficit. Couper sous Harper « n’a pas livré une croissance économique », martèle-t-il. » – Antoine Robitaille (Journal de Québec), Twitter, 10 octobre, 2019
“Scheer says he’ll fight climate change in a global context. Translation: he’ll blame China and India.” – Peter F. Jackson, Journalist, Twitter, October 10, 2019
“Scheer is again lying about the output-based pricing system.” – Dale Smith, Twitter, October 10, 2019
“Singh deploying his false talking points about companies buying limos and jets.” – Dale Smith, Twitter, October 10, 2019
“Bernier, Trudeau, Scheer on economy. Trudeau dominating.” – Stephen Maher (Maclean’s) Twitter, October 10, 2019
“Scheer says he’s proposed a plan to balance the budget in five years. Trudeau: ‘We haven’t seen it. We haven’t seen it.’ (He’s right on that. Scheer has released costings for individual promises, but tomorrow releases the full platform.)” – Tonda MacCharles (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 10, 2019
“So, May touts of her platform’s @IFSD_IFPD pass. The Greens passed on realistic economic assumptions and transparency. They failed on fiscal management.” – John Geddes (Maclean’s), Twitter, October 10, 2019
“The poverty rate in Canada has fallen to unprecedented lows under the @liberal_party government. @StatCan_eng has said this in significant part is due to policy changes introduced by the government.” – Miles Corak (The Graduate Center, City University of New York), Twitter, October 10, 2019
“Now Bloc is on the spot for supporting a Quebec LNG pipeline but not Alberta pipelines. He is vulnerable on this file as former environment minister.” – Evan Solomon (CTV), Twitter, October 10, 2019
« Trudeau : Rappelle les coupes de Doug Ford aux franco-ontariens et avertir que les Conservateurs vont le continuer. Vante son bilan en langues officielles au cours des 4 dernières années. » – Christopher G. Nardi (Journal de Montréal), Twitter, 10 octobre, 2019
“Singh has not punched through as he did before. Scheer also has not really landed a heavy blow.” – Evan Solomon (CTV), Twitter, October 10, 2019
“Trudeau seems to have some fire in his belly tonight.” – Stephen Maher (Maclean’s), Twitter, October 10, 2019
“@theJagmeetSingh asked why NDP opposes every trade agreement. Asked if he is a protectionist. Singh repeats his talking points about working for you and why [NAFTA] is bad but doesn’t answer question.” – Evan Solomon (CTV), Twitter, October 10, 2019
“So, my bet is Trudeau will be happy with debate.” – Evan Solomon (CTV), Twitter, October 10, 2019

It’s now been a week since Andrew Scheer tried to slip his cuts plan by Canadians, hoping they wouldn’t notice. But no one fell for it. Every day, Canadians are asking what Andrew Scheer’s cut plans means for their communities. Here is what some of them are saying:
Quotations are included in their original language
“Trudeau and the Liberals have accomplished important things since 2015. And they offer the best program for continuing in that positive direction over the next four years.” – Toronto Star Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
« Andrew Scheer ne semble pas particulièrement fier de son cadre financier. Il l’a rendu public quelques heures après le dernier débat des chefs, juste avant un long week-end où l’annonce serait forcément noyée. Qu’y retrouve-t-on, au juste ? Une feuille de route qui ressemble à celle de son prédécesseur, Stephen Harper. » – François Cardinal, La Presse, 18 octobre 2019
« [La plan d’Andrew Scheer] l’oblige évidemment à multiplier les compressions pour espérer atteindre l’équilibre budgétaire en cinq ans. Des compressions dans les infrastructures, la sécurité nationale et l’environnement, entre autres, qui s’annoncent… plus importantes que celles imposées par M. Harper. Ce qui risque d’avoir un effet concret réel, notamment en matière d’investissements en transports en commun. » – François Cardinal, La Presse, 18 octobre 2019
“[T]he government made a fundamental choice at the beginning of its mandate to make sure the wealth is more evenly shared. It cut taxes on the middle class, raised them on the wealthy and directed a lot more support to families with the new Canada Child Benefit. All that made a huge difference in the lives of many people, especially those on low incomes. The child benefit, in particular, is a key reason why more than 800,000 people, including some 300,000 children, have escaped poverty over the past few years. This is no small thing; it simply wouldn’t have happened if the Conservatives had remained in power and put austerity ahead of people.” – Toronto Star Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“On housing Andrew Scheer would move us backwards and make housing less affordable. On transit Andrew Scheer’s $18B cut to infrastructure would kill SkyTrain to UBC. On opioids Andrew Scheer would drag us back into court while more people die.” – Kennedy Stewart (Mayor of Vancouver), Statement, October 16, 2019
“There are shortcomings in [the Conservative] platform that are of concern to me.” – John Tory (Mayor of Toronto), Toronto Star, October 17, 2019
“[Andrew Scheer’s proposed] postponement of infrastructure investments is something that is not in the best interests of Toronto or cities across the country” and [Conservatives haven’t] “said as much about housing” [as other parties]. – John Tory (Mayor of Toronto), Toronto Star, October 17, 2019
“[Conservatives] would slash $18 billion from infrastructure spending, killing or delaying badly needed projects across the country. They would cut deeply in spending on government operations, a promise reminiscent of Doug Ford’s pledge to cut “fat.” We know how that’s turning out in Ontario. Under Scheer, the Conservatives would lurch to the right in foreign affairs. And, crucially, they would throw the government into reverse when it comes to effective action on climate change.” – Toronto Star Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“Liberal management of the economy has led to near record low unemployment, strong job creation and needed infrastructure investment. The Conservative claim to superiority is largely around promised tax cuts, but the truth is that tax cuts alone have not in the past generated comparable economic strength and sustained prosperity.” – Hamilton Spectator Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“The Liberals also chose to spread wealth more evenly. Taxes on the middle class were reduced and the Canada Child Benefit was introduced. Thanks to the CCB, 800,000 people, including 300,000 children, have been lifted out of poverty. This would not have happened under an austerity-driven Conservative government.” – Hamilton Spectator Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
“The Conservatives would kill the carbon tax, tax big polluters and encourage green innovation. That, as numerous scientists have pointed out, isn’t even a plan. Under Scheer’s Conservatives, Canada would move backwards, which would be shirking our responsibility to future generations.” – Hamilton Spectator Editorial Board, October 16, 2019
« Contrairement à ce qu’il affirmait cette semaine, l’engagement du chef conservateur Andrew Scheer à financer ses promesses en réduisant les investissements prévus dans les infrastructures menace la construction d’un tramway à Québec, en plus de certains projets prévus à Montréal. » – Claude Villeneuve, Journal de Montréal, 18 octobre, 2019
« Si on réduit les investissements totaux en infrastructures, nécessairement, Montréal aura moins. À la ville, on évalue que c’est une somme de 1,6 milliard qui est en jeu, ce qui compromettrait la réalisation de projets de 4 milliards financés conjointement avec Québec. » – Claude Villeneuve, Journal de Montréal, 18 octobre, 2019

Ottawa, ON – Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada announced today that the Hon. Navdeep Bains, Nikki Hipkin, Brittney Kerr, the Hon. Dominic LeBlanc, and Sylvie Paradis will serve as Co-Chairs of the party’s National Campaign Committee for the 2019 federal election campaign.
“Since 2015, we’ve been making important progress together to grow the economy, strengthen our middle class, and make life better for Canadian families – and there’s much more hard work ahead of us than behind us,” said Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. “Building on the hope and hard work of dedicated Liberal volunteers across Canada, the leadership and diversity of our National Campaign Committee will help build a positive 2019 campaign that engages more Canadians than ever before in our fast-growing Liberal movement.”
The 2019 National Campaign Committee consists of experienced campaign leaders from across Canada who have worked with all orders of government, non-profits, and the private sector, and who have also served as Liberal parliamentarians, campaign organizers, and local Liberal EDA Chairs. In addition, Mona Fortier and the Hon. Ralph Goodale are leading platform development consultations as Co-Chairs of the 2019 National Platform Committee.
Liberal campaigns across Canada are starting 2019 strong, with more than 160 Team Trudeau 2019 candidates already confirmed. Liberal volunteers have started more than one million new conversations with Canadians over the past year, and hosted more than 700 volunteer engagement events in 2018 – the party’s largest ever volunteer mobilization outside of an election.
Liberal supporters also recently achieved the party’s strongest-ever third quarter for grassroots fundraising outside of a campaign, and the Liberal Party is now heading into the 2019 campaign with more active monthly donors than at any time in the party’s history.

Ottawa, ON – If the Conservatives had their way during the NAFTA negotiations, Canada would have backed down.
“In the NAFTA negotiations, our Liberal government fought tooth and nail to protect Canadian jobs. We said we would get a good deal, and that’s exactly what we achieved,” said Chrystia Freeland, Liberal candidate in the Toronto riding of University—Rosedale. “Conservatives urged Canada to fold to America’s demands — no matter the cost to our economy or middle class workers.”
Here’s how the Conservatives would have backed down to the United States:

Stephen Harper – in the fall of 2017, Harper released a memo that publicly said Canada has no leverage and needs to accept American demands. “Canada will be left with no option but to gradually capitulate,” Harper said. He was wrong. Macleans described Harper’s bad negotiating strategy: “What would Harper have the Canadian bargaining position be? In the absence of red lines drawn in public, apparently he would have the Canadian negotiating team tell the Americans, again in public: ‘We have no bottom line.’” (Macleans, Oct 30, 2017)
Andrew Scheer – In August 2018, when the United States told Canada to take-it-or-leave it. We said no and held out for a better deal.But Andrew Scheer and Erin O’Toole panicked. “Canadians are now on the outside,” tweeted Scheer, urging us to join the U.S.-Mexico deal. As we negotiated hard for the next six weeks, Conservatives publicly urged us to submit to the American offer.
Steel & Aluminum – The Conservatives repeatedly urged us to back down to the Americans by dropping retaliatory steel & aluminum tariffs. If we took the Conservative advice, the U.S. tariffs would still be in place. On February 4, 2019, Doug Ford’s Conservatives held a press conference calling on us to unilaterally and unconditionally drop our countermeasures. And taking his cue from Doug Ford, Erin O’Toole tweeted that we should drop our retaliatory measures.

“We stood up to Donald Trump on trade when the Conservatives wanted Canada to back down. The Conservatives told us to take any deal we could get. Capitulation is not a negotiating strategy,” said Freeland.

The leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Franco-Ontarian Day:
“Today we celebrate the rich history and significant contribution Franco-Ontarians have made to our country. On this Franco-Ontarian Day, I would like to acknowledge the largest Francophone minority community in the country.
On September 25, 1975, the beautiful Franco-Ontarian flag was raised for the first time in front of the University of Sudbury. I want to recognize the work of all those who still today defend their presence and their choice to live in French in Ontario. I also want to take the occasion to emphasize our ongoing commitment to always denounce injustice and to stand with the Franco-Ontarian community and with all Francophones.
Strengthening our official languages and the vitality of linguistic minority communities is rooted in the values of the Liberal Party of Canada. Everyday we work to make Canada a country where we can live and grow in the language of our choice.
Over the course of our mandate, we worked diligently with official language minority communities across Canada and we are proud of the work we accomplished. From our Action Plan for Official Languages which includes an historic $2.7 billion investment, to the restoration of the Court Challenges Program, the nomination of bilingual judges to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the recent memorandum of co-operation for the creation of a Francophone University in Ontario, we are and will be here for you.
As part of the modernization of the Official Languages Act, a re-elected Liberal government will continue its work and do even more. Together, we will take on important projects to benefit future generations of Francophones and Francophiles in Ontario and across Canada.”

Ottawa, ON — On the debate stage tonight, Justin Trudeau proved that the Liberal plan is the only credible choice for Canadians who want more money in their pockets, a cleaner environment, and safer communities.
Andrew Scheer spent the entire night attacking Justin Trudeau, while Mr. Trudeau stayed focused on what matters most — giving more help to the middle class and the people working hard to join it.
“Canadians want to know why Andrew Scheer is offering millionaires a $50,000 tax break, and 17 billion dollars in cuts for everybody else,” said Mr. Trudeau.
Andrew Scheer doubled down on his flawed plan to give tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthiest one per cent. Our plan will lower taxes for those who need a break, saving middle class families almost $600 a year, without giving a cent to millionaires.
The debate also showed Canadians once again that the Conservatives have no plan to fight climate change. Andrew Scheer made it clear that he doesn’t think it’s possible to grow the economy and fight climate change. The first thing he would do — his first action as Prime Minister — would be to tear up our plan to fight climate change, taking back the money we’ve put in Canadians’ pockets. He is wrong. We will create jobs, reduce pollution, and leave a healthier planet for our kids and grandkids.
“Conservative premiers have gotten elected on promises to do nothing on climate change, and we need a strong federal government to fight them to make sure we are moving forward on protecting future generations from climate change,” said Mr. Trudeau.
Tonight’s debate made the thing crystal clear: the other parties are either unable — or unwilling — to move us forward. Only Liberals have the plan, and the team, to keep Canada moving forward, for everyone.

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new series of ads that highlight how a re-elected Liberal government will continue to make life more affordable for Canadians, protect our environment, and keep our communities safe.
“Andrew Scheer wants you to think this election is about me. I think it’s about you,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, in one of the ads. “This is your country and your choice.”
As millions of Canadians gather with loved ones around the Thanksgiving dinner table, the choice they face on October 21st could not be more clear. Do we:

Build on a serious climate plan, or leave the problem to our kids and grandkids?
Keep cutting taxes for the middle class, or give tax breaks to big polluters and the wealthiest one percent?
Make gun control laws stronger, or weaker?
Invest in our future, or let the Conservatives cut everything we care about?

A re-elected Liberal government will build on the progress we’ve made and continue to make life more affordable for Canadians. Our plan will help people:

Save nearly $600 a year, per family, thanks to our tax cut that helps the middle class, not the richest one percent;
Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by ten per cent once they turn 75, increasing by more $729 each year;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments if they’re buying their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save on medications their family needs when we implement Universal Pharmacare;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care by ten percent;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and get 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

“Let’s do what Canadians always do,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Pull together and move forward.”

Ottawa, ON – Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, will deliver remarks to supporters at an open Liberal fundraising event in Ottawa on August 22, 2019.
In this fall’s important election, Ontarians and all Canadians will have a clear choice. While Conservatives want to go backward with cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class.
The Liberal Party of Canada has also committed to the strongest standards in federal politics for openness and transparency with political fundraising events, and is challenging other parties to do the same.

Ottawa, ON – The Liberal Party of Canada has achieved its best-ever fourth quarter for grassroots fundraising outside of an election year, with more than 45,000 Canadians having contributed $6,361,562 to support Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team’s positive plan to strengthen the middle class and grow our economy.
This new Liberal fundraising record provides a strong start to 2019 with the federal election now less than 9 months away, and builds on a similar record achieved in the preceding quarter for the Liberal Party’s best-ever Q3 outside of an election year.
“Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are making real progress to strengthen our middle class, grow our economy, and make life better for Canadian families, and Canadians are responding with some of the strongest grassroots fundraising support that our party has ever seen,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “While Andrew Scheer is doubling down on the same divisive politics we saw from Stephen Harper and continuing to bar journalists from behind-closed-doors Conservative fundraising events, the Liberal Party is focused on positive politics and a real plan to build a better future for all Canadians.”
The median donation to the Liberal Party in Q4 was just $15 at a time, and 92 percent of all donations were under $200. There are also now more active monthly grassroots donors to the Liberal Party of Canada than at any other time in the party’s history.
Recent filings with Elections Canada have also highlighted that Liberal supporters are getting far more value for their donations than Conservatives. The 2017 annual returns show that the Conservative Party spent $7,189,100 on fundraising expenses throughout the year while the Liberal Party spent just $2,702,363.
Liberal campaigns across Canada are starting 2019 strong, with more than 165 Team Trudeau 2019 candidates already confirmed. Liberal volunteers have started more than one million new conversations with Canadians over the past year, and hosted more than 700 volunteer engagement events in 2018 – the party’s largest ever volunteer mobilization outside of an election.

Toronto, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released new ads warning Canadians that Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives would cut and paste from the playbook of Stephen Harper — making deep cuts to programs and less help for the people who need it.
“I’ve seen all kinds of governments come and go,” says Lawrence MacAulay, Liberal candidate in the riding of Cardigan, in one of the new ads. “When we elected the Conservatives all they did was cut taxes for the wealthy, and cut services for everyone else.”
Since 2015, a Liberal government has worked hard to undo the harmful changes made by the Conservatives. For example:

After Stephen Harper raised the retirement age to 67, we lowered it back to 65 and increased Old Age Security (OAS) payments;
After Harper closed offices and clawed back benefits for veterans, we re-opened those offices and re-instated lifelong pensions; and
After the Conservatives kept sending child care cheques to millionaires, we created the tax-free and more generous Canada Child Benefit — putting hundreds of dollars back into the pockets of middle class families, and those working hard to join the middle class.

Now, Andrew Scheer’s plan will lower taxes the most for wealthier Canadians. With his approach, a person making $40,000 will get less than a person making $400,000. He also voted against lowering the OAS eligibility age from 67 to 65 — which boosts seniors’ retirement savings by thousands of dollars — and his party pledged to reverse the changes we made to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan.
The Liberal plan, however, builds on the progress we’ve made investing in families, workers, and communities. Under our plan, we will cut taxes for the middle class, without giving a break to millionaires. We will give more help to older Canadians and veterans. And we will continue to take bold action to protect our environment and fight climate change.
“Soon, Canadians will have a choice to make,” said Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “Go back to the Harper years, or keep moving forward with a government that stands by all Canadians.”

Sudbury, ON — A re-elected Liberal government will protect 25 per cent of Canada’s land and 25 per cent of Canada’s oceans by 2025, as well as give every kid in Canada the chance to learn to camp.
Canada has the longest coastline in the world, one-fifth of the world’s fresh water, and vast and wild forests — but climate change puts them all at risk. It’s more important than ever to protect the natural landscape we know and love. At the same time, Canadians of all ages should have the chance to enjoy our natural wonders and learn more about our country.
“We have listened to the courageous voices of young people who are demanding that their governments take bold action to protect our nature for future generations,” said Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “And we know that we raise environmental champions by helping the next generation experience Canada’s natural beauty firsthand.”
A re-elected Liberal will continue down the path of conservation and environmental protection:

We will conserve and protect 25 per cent of Canada’s land and 25 per cent of Canada’s oceans by 2025, working towards 30 per cent of each by 2030;
We will ground these efforts in science, Indigenous knowledge, and local perspectives;
We will also advocate for countries around the world to set a 30 per cent conservation goal as well;
We will give every child the chance to learn how to camp by the time they reach grade eight, expanding the successful Learn to Camp program:
This will make it possible for 400,000 kids each year to learn the skills to enjoy camping; and
We will give 75,000 less privileged children and their families an up to four night trip to one of Canada’s National or Provincial Parks:
This includes camping accommodations and a travel bursary of up to $2,000 so that families can more easily afford a once-in-a-lifetime trip to more national parks like Banff, Gros Morne, Forillon and the Cape Breton Highlands.

This builds on a strong Liberal tradition of protecting Canada’s land and oceans, including:

Making the largest investment in nature conservation in Canadian history;
Conserving land areas equal to about 3.5 times the size of Nova Scotia;
Boosting the amount of protected coastal and ocean areas from 1 per cent to 14 per cent;
Creating Rouge National Urban Park, North America’s largest urban park, and the Edéhzhíe Protected Area, the first Indigenous protected area;
Working in partnership with Inuit to protect the Arctic’s last year-round sea ice, as well as sensitive areas in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and glass sponge reefs off the coast of British Columbia.

“The Conservatives spent a decade starving Parks Canada of funding, and ripping up protections for nearly all Canadian waters,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We only get one planet, and one Canada. Let’s protect it, for our kids and grandkids to enjoy — today and for years to come.”

Gatineau, QC – Tonight, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, showed once again that the Liberals are the only party with a credible plan for the environment, the economy, and middle-class families.
“What we saw in 2015 was that Quebecers and Canadians chose to be part of a government. That’s what ended Mr. Harper’s 10 years of not investing in culture and cutting everywhere, said the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, during the debate. We will always stand up for our values ​​and principles, such as the right of women to choose and the rights of Francophones across Canada. That’s what we will always do.”
Once again, the debate made it clear that Andrew Scheer is completely disconnected from the reality of Quebecers and Francophone communities across the country. His divisive policies and negative tone offer nothing concrete for young people, middle-class families, and seniors. We know that the Conservatives’ phantom platform will give $50,000 in tax credits to millionaires, but with only a few days left until the election, we still don’t know which services they will cut.
Just like we’ve done for the last four years, the Liberal Party is choosing to invest in middle-class families by putting even more money back in their pockets, whether by cutting their taxes or lowering their cell phone bills.
Justin Trudeau also took the opportunity to remind Canadians that the Liberal Party is the only one with a credible plan to fight climate change while creating good jobs — from planting two billion trees, to helping Canadians retrofit their homes to make them more energy-efficient.
Finally, Justin Trudeau reaffirmed that a diverse and open Canada is a stronger Canada. Newcomers grow our economy, strengthen our communities, and help reduce labour shortages.
“In a few days, Quebecers — and all Canadians — will have a choice to make about the future of our country,” said Justin Trudeau. “If the environment, the rising cost of living, and gun control matter to you, the Liberal Party is the party that will deliver. It’s by electing people to government — not to the opposition benches — that we can make progress. On October 21, let’s pull together and continue to move forward.”

OTTAWA – By refusing to have the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer cost the Conservative platform, Andrew Scheer is following Doug Ford’s lead by planning to hide massive cuts, said Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez.
Rodriguez was referring to a Radio-Canada report this morning that stated Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are refusing to allow the Parliamentary Budget Officer to independently audit the Conservative election platform.
“Andrew Scheer is refusing to allow an independent check of the numbers so the Conservatives can hide massive cuts,” said Rodriguez. “That’s what Doug Ford did and now Ontarians are seeing cuts to their libraries, cuts to flood mitigation, cuts to public health agencies that work to address health crises like SARS, H1N1, and others. Andrew Scheer is planning to do the same thing.”
The Liberal Party welcomes the external costing of our platform by the Parliamentary Budget Officer. Andrew Scheer refuses to be upfront with Canadians about what he will cut. But his actions speak louder than his words:

Scheer is opposed to lowering taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest.
Scheer is opposed to the Canada Child Benefit that helps more than 3.2 million families and more than 5.8 million children.
Scheer is opposed to the increase to the Guaranteed Income Supplement, which helps almost 800,000 seniors across the country.
Scheer is opposed to strengthening the Canada Pension Plan, which helps Canadians afford a more secure retirement.

“We challenge Andrew Scheer to stop taking his marching orders from Doug Ford and submit his platform to the PBO. This provides open and transparent information to Canadians so that they are able to know what Andrew Scheer will cut before they make their decision this October,” said Rodriguez.

Ottawa, ON – The Liberal Party of Canada announced today that the 2020 Liberal National Convention will be hosted in Ottawa, Ontario, from November 12- 15, 2020.
“After a successful re-election campaign driven by the largest volunteer mobilization in our party’s history, I’m looking forward to welcoming Liberals from across Canada to our 2020 Liberal National Convention in Ottawa,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “As Justin Trudeau and our Liberal team move forward with a new mandate of hard work for Canadians, this convention will bring together Liberals from every part of Canada to continue growing the most open and inclusive movement in Canadian politics.”
The 2020 Liberal National Convention will welcome thousands of supporters for policy discussions, keynote speakers, innovative campaign trainings, and the election of our National Board of Directors. This convention will build on the success of the 2018 Liberal National Convention in Halifax, which set a strong foundation for the 2019 federal election campaign by welcoming more youth under 25 as participants than ever before — and more than half of all participants were attending their first-ever political convention.
“The decision to hold the 2020 Liberal National Convention here in Ottawa, home to Canada’s Parliament, speaks to our commitment to bringing Canadians together and engaging more people in our democracy,” said Mona Fortier, Member of Parliament for Ottawa—Vanier. “Justin Trudeau and our Liberal team are ready to move forward with our plan to make life more affordable for the middle class, grow our economy, keep our communities safe, and fight climate change — and the 2020 Liberal National Convention will help shape the next steps of our work together to build a better future.”
The convention will build on the grassroots organizing that led towards the Liberal Party of Canada’s successful 2019 re-election campaign, which also saw the party’s largest-ever volunteer mobilization and digital engagement programs. Tens of thousands of Liberal volunteers made more than 21 million knocks and calls before and during the campaign to start new conversations with Canadians about Justin Trudeau’s positive plan to Choose Forward.

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new ad highlighting that a re-elected Liberal government will give middle class families an extra $600 every year by lowering taxes, while a Conservative government would give more breaks to millionaires.
“We believe in helping those who need it most: middle class Canadians and people working hard to join them,” says the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, in the new ad. “We’re proposing a tax cut, where a middle class family gets $600 and the wealthiest one per cent get zero.”
Earlier this week, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will make sure middle class Canadians, and the people working to join the middle class, pay no federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn. This will be done by raising the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) by almost $2,000 for people earning under $147,000 a year.
This Liberal middle class tax cut will:

Save the average family nearly $600 a year;
Mean 700,000 people will pay no tax at all — nearly 60 per cent of whom are women;
Lift about 40,000 Canadians out of poverty; and
Benefit only the middle class and those working hard to join it, not the richest one percent.

Andrew Scheer has a plan that will lower taxes the most for wealthier Canadians. With his approach, a person making $40,000 will get less than a person making $400,000.
“Whenever the Conservatives cut taxes, they cut them for the wealthy — and in this election, it’s no different,” continues Mr. Trudeau in the ad. “The Conservative approach would go back to giving tax breaks to millionaires.”
This middle class tax cut is just one way a re-elected Liberal government will make life more affordable, saving Canadian families thousands of dollars each year. An average family in Canada will also:

Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by ten per cent once they turn 75, increasing by more $729 each year;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments if they’re buying their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save on medications their family needs when we implement Universal Pharmacare;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care by ten percent;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and get 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

Last year, I had the chance to visit Armenia and meet with Prime Minister Pashinyan to discuss further strengthening our bilateral relationship through travel, tourism, and trade. The visit shone a light on the close ties between Canadians and Armenians – ties that are at the heart of our relationship.
In Canada, we know that diversity is our strength, and every day, the 60,000-strong Armenian Canadian community contributes to our country’s success. When Armenian Canadians welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees, they showed the way forward with compassion and generosity. We share a commitment to the successful settlement and integration of all newcomers.
On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish a happy Armenian Independence Day to everyone celebrating.”

Ottawa, ON – Liberal M.P. , the Hon. Carolyn Bennett, issued the following statement today:
“In December, First Nations Chiefs asked Andrew Scheer what his policy toward the spirit of reconciliation would be. How would he differ from his Conservative predecessors?
“They were not happy to hear his response that they should have patience and wait for his platform.
“Andrew Scheer has now completed his five “major policy speeches,” outlining his party’s next election platform. The word “reconciliation,” was not uttered once.
“His silence on this issue is not only disrespectful, it is totally irresponsible. There are more than 1.6 million First Nations, Inuit and Métis in Canada, and they are the fastest growing population. A “vision” for Canada that does not include a plan to recognize and implement the rights of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, or to close the socioeconomic gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples is completely unacceptable.
“Meanwhile, Andrew Scheer’s Conservative Senators are blocking Bill C-262, an important piece of legislation that would ensure that Canada’s laws respect the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Since they refuse to let this legislation pass, the Liberal Party will make it part of our election platform this fall.
“Andrew Scheer is applying to be the leader of our country. He has a responsibility to understand the issues facing the First Peoples of this country and work with First Nations, Inuit and Métis in order to come to the table with a real plan to address their priorities.
“Canadians have supported and are working towards a new relationship with indigenous peoples based upon the recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership.
“With his final policy speech yesterday, Andrew Scheer has confirmed what Canadians have long suspected: Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is not part of his Vision for Canada.
“Stephen Harper did not work with Indigenous peoples to advance reconciliation and demonstrated that he thought Ottawa knew best.
“Andrew Scheer has demonstrated that he is no different.”

Ottawa, ON — For the first time ever, young Canadians will outnumber every other voting-aged generation. They have the power to help move Canada forward, standing up against the Conservatives’ cuts and regressive politics.
Today, Liberal candidates Catherine McKenna, Harjit Sajjan and Mélanie Joly are encouraging young people to use that power and vote — especially now that it’s easier than ever, with special voting stations opening on a number of college and university campuses from today until October 9.
Up To YOUth — a campaign created by young leaders involved with the Liberal Party of Canada — is also highlighting why a re-elected Liberal government is the best choice to move Canada forward on the issues that young Canadians care most about.
“The things we’re talking about as Liberals — more affordable tuition, rent and cell phone bills, stronger actions to fight climate change — they’re resonating with young people,” said McKenna, the Liberal candidate in the riding of Ottawa Centre. “So we’re seeing more and more young people stepping up and asking how they can be partners in creating a Canada that is more fair, and more affordable, for everyone.”
In 2015, young people came out in record numbers to elect Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party — countering the idea that they care less about democracy, or are less engaged with what’s happening in the world.
“Young people care about improving the lives of others, about fighting the climate crisis, and ensuring that everyone feels welcome and accepted in Canada,” said Sajjan, the Liberal candidate in the riding of Vancouver South. “Those values are Liberal values, and young people see that.”
For example, a re-elected Liberal government will:

Give up to $1,200 more each year to students to pay for tuition, books and rent by increasing Canada Student Grants by 40 per cent;
Give students two years — interest free — before they need to begin repaying student loans, and then only if they’re earning at least $35,000.
Make life more affordable for young people, lowering cell phone bills by 25 per cent and saving first time homebuyers hundreds on their mortgage each month;
Get Canada to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, in part by planting two billion trees;
Continue to make big polluters pay, and conserving 25 per cent of Canada’s land and waters;
Protect women’s rights to make decisions about their bodies, and improve their access to health care;
Set clear national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get the support they need quickly, when they need it most;
Protect same-sex marriage, ban conversion therapy and fund more LGBTQ2 community groups;
Fight racism, and target online hate speech, exploitation, bullying and harassment; and
Make big corporations and the wealthiest one per cent of Canadians pay their fair share of taxes.

“Young people are paying attention — they know what an Andrew Scheer government will do,” said Ahuntsic-Cartierville Liberal candidate, Joly. “The very wealthiest will get to keep more money. Big polluters will get to dirty our air and water for free again. Debates we thought were over — about abortion or same-sex marriage — will resurface. Young people aren’t going to stand by and let that happen, and neither will we.”

Nanaimo, BC – Liberals in Nanaimo—Ladysmith have nominated Michelle Corfield, a devoted community volunteer and local business leader, as the official Team Trudeau candidate in the upcoming federal by-election.

Ottawa, ON – The following statement was issued by Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada:
—-
“On behalf of Liberals across Canada, I want to congratulate Rachel Bendayan and her team on their hard-earned victory, and I know that she will be a dedicated voice for Outremont in Parliament. I also want to thank Richard T. Lee and Shaun Tanaka for their inspiring campaigns.
“Tonight, the people of Outremont and thousands of Canadians voting in these by-elections have offered a strong vote of confidence in Justin Trudeau’s positive plan to strengthen the middle class, and build a better future for all Canadians.
“The Liberal plan is helping the middle class and everyone working hard to join it, with important steps like lowering taxes for nine million middle class Canadians, a stronger Canada Pension Plan, and the Canada Child Benefit – which gives more money to 9 out of 10 Canadian families. Canadians have now created more than 900,000 new jobs since 2015, and Canada’s unemployment rate is near the lowest it’s been in over 40 years.
“Liberal campaigns across Canada are starting 2019 strong, with new by-election victories, more than one million new conversations with Canadians over the past year, and more than 700 volunteer engagement events in 2018 – the party’s largest ever volunteer mobilization outside of an election. Rachel is an outstanding addition to Team Trudeau, and together, we’ll keep fighting for Canadian families and a strong middle class.”

Ottawa, ON – Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada announced today that the Hon. Ralph Goodale, Member of Parliament for Regina—Wascana, and Mona Fortier, Member of Parliament for Ottawa—Vanier, will serve as Co-Chairs of the party’s National Platform Committee in advance of the 2019 federal election campaign.
“Hearing ideas from Canadians directly has always been at the heart of our work together to keep the economy strong, create good new jobs, and make sure that everyone has a real and fair chance at success,” said Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. “Ralph and Mona’s experience and leadership will help us engage even more Canadians in shaping our positive plan to create more opportunity for the middle class and everyone working hard to join it.”
Fortier and Goodale will begin discussions and consultations with business, labour, environmental, Indigenous, and community leaders across Canada, in addition to continuing to hear new ideas from grassroots Liberals, the Liberal caucus, and Canadians directly.
These new conversations will build on the Liberal Party of Canada’s work to build the most open, inclusive, and engaging movement in Canadian politics – with nearly 6,000 Canadians having already participated in national online policy voting ahead of April’s 2018 Liberal National Convention in Halifax. Liberal volunteers also recently started hundreds of thousands of new conversations with Canadians as part of 579 Summer of Action events across Canada in July and August.
Mona Fortier has served as the Member of Parliament for Ottawa-Vanier since April 2017, and has extensive previous experience and expertise in the areas of health care, education, job creation and francophone affairs. The Hon. Ralph Goodale was first elected to Parliament in 1974. He is currently the Member of Parliament for Regina—Wascana and Canada’s Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. In 2015, he served as Co-Chair of the National Liberal Platform Committee. Previously, he has also served as Canada’s Minister of Finance, Minister of Public Works, Minister Natural Resources, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons.

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day of the Girl:
“Girls are taking this world by storm. They’re climate leaders. Voices for justice. Entrepreneurs transforming our communities. Artists telling our stories.
On International Day of the Girl, we celebrate girls and young women everywhere. And we come together to promote girls’ rights, and break down the barriers that still hold girls back. Around the globe, girls are leading that charge – fighting for what they believe in, making their voices heard.
Over the last four years, our Liberal government has made major strides to support girls everywhere, and that’s what we’ll continue to do. Under our G7 presidency, we worked with partners to announce a historic investment of $3.8 billion in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations – the largest of its kind ever made. This past summer, we announced another unprecedented investment – this time, to defend the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls globally. And a few weeks ago, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will commit at least ten per cent of our international assistance to education, and lead global efforts to make sure kids growing up in refugee or displacement camps get the education they need and deserve.
We’re working just as hard to support girls and young women growing up in Canada. We will make it easier for young women to pay for post-secondary education by increasing Canada Student Grants by 40 per cent, and by giving students a full two years after graduating before they need to start paying off their student loans – interest free. We’ve worked to eliminate the gender gap in the workforce, from creating pay equity legislation, to launching the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, to helping more women start a career in the trades. We’ve made it a top priority to end violence against women and girls, through the Strategy to Prevent and End Gender-Based Violence and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. We’ve all got to be allies to girls, because building a better world starts there.
To girls in Canada and around the world: there are going to be people out there who try to stand in your way. And that is simply because they’re afraid of your power – power you show us every day when you challenge us to do better. But there will always be more of us who are here to stand with you and help you create the future you want to see. So don’t hold back, and don’t let anyone stop you. You can do anything you set your mind to. Chase down your dreams, because this is your world.
Girls are the future, and the future starts today.”

Montréal, QC – The Liberal Party of Canada is launching a significant new advertising campaign as the 2019 election approaches, highlighting how Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are the only party that will stand up for middle class families.
Beginning today, new french-language national advertising featuring Justin Trudeau will air in heavy rotation on television across Québec and online across Canada, accompanied by a series of radio ads from Liberal MPs that will begin airing today in every part of Québec. New billboards are also being placed on major routes leading to the new Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge, as a reminder of how Liberals took a stand for middle class families and removed the tolls that the Conservatives had planned for it.
“Since 2015, Justin Trudeau and our Liberal team have stood up for middle class families,” said Pablo Rodriguez, Québec Campaign Co-Chair and M.P. for Honoré-Mercier. “After 10 years of Stephen Harper’s failed policies left the middle class falling behind, we’ve been making real progress – with one million new jobs created, more money for families, and real action to protect our environment. But there’s so much more to do, and we will never stop working hard to build a better future.”
Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team have a real plan to strengthen the middle class, grow the economy, and make life better for Canadian families. By introducing the Canada Child Benefit, lowering taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest 1 percent, putting a national price on pollution, and protecting middle class jobs with the new NAFTA, Justin Trudeau has been taking a stand for Canadians – but there’s so much more to do, and we can’t let the Conservatives take us back to the failed policies of Stephen Harper.
“This fall, Quebecers and all Canadians will have a clear choice to make,” added Diane Lebouthillier, Québec Campaign Co-Chair and M.P. for Gaspésie—Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine. “While Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are focused on investing in the middle class, Andrew Scheer is focused on austerity and cutting vital services, just like Stephen Harper.”
Liberal campaigns across Canada have started 2019 strong, with a new by-election victory in Outremont, continued growth in grassroots fundraising, more than 200 nominated candidates, and the momentum of more than 1.5 million new conversations with Canadians and 1,000 volunteer engagement events over the past year – the party’s largest-ever volunteer mobilization outside of an election.

Mississauga, ON – Today Andrew Scheer revealed his deep cuts will target $7.5 billion in direct support for jobs and workers across the country.
“Andrew Scheer needs to tell Canadians what jobs and workers he will target. Will he cut support for 6,900 steel workers in Hamilton, 200 aerospace workers in Nova Scotia, 2,100 steel workers in Regina and across Western Canada, or 450 cleantech jobs in British Columbia?” said Liberal candidate for Markham—Thornhill, Mary Ng. “Andrew Scheer is doing exactly what Conservative politicians do; they pretend they’re for the people during the election, then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everyone else – in this case, thousands of jobs across the country.”
“Included in Andrew Scheer’s announcement today are steel workers across Canada. In the face of punishing U.S. steel tariffs, Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government invested $100 million to protect 6,900 steel jobs in Hamilton alone. Andrew Scheer just turned his back on those steel workers,” said Ng.
“Andrew Scheer today promised he will cut $7.5 billion in jobs support – but his math doesn’t add up. What else will he cut?” said Ng. “Like Doug Ford, Andrew Scheer is promising cuts on a five-year timeline to balance the budget. The problem is that today’s announcement is far from the $39 billion he needs to cut to pay for all his campaign announcements so far.”

Toronto, ON — Today, the Liberal Party of Canada unveiled its plan to move forward for a stronger middle class, and for a better Canada for all Canadians.
“Middle class Canadians do the heavy lifting in our economy,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “So when we choose to give more help to the middle class and the people working hard to join it, we are choosing a stronger economy. We are choosing a more affordable, more fair Canada. We are choosing a cleaner, better country for our kids and grandkids. We are choosing forward.”
Forward: A Real Plan for the Middle Class builds on the progress we’ve made investing in families, workers, and communities. Under our plan, we will cut taxes for the middle class, without giving a break to millionaires. We will ban assault rifles and strengthen gun control. And we will continue to take bold action to protect our environment and fight climate change.
“The Conservatives want to go back to the Harper years, where they give tax cuts to millionaires, loosen gun regulations, and make it free to pollute again,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Andrew Scheer doesn’t think it’s possible to grow the economy and fight climate change. He’s wrong. Our plan will create jobs, reduce pollution, and leave a healthier planet for our kids and grandkids.”
When a Liberal government is re-elected, the average family in Canada will also:

Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
Save nearly $600 a year when we lower taxes for everyone but the already wealthy;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by at least $729 when they turn 75;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments on their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

Forward: A Real Plan for the Middle Class also gives real help to the next generation of Canadian leaders. The costs of tuition, rent, books, and groceries — along with cuts to student aid by provincial Conservative governments — are putting an immense amount of pressure and stress on students.
A re-elected Liberal government will help more students prepare for good jobs while taking on less debt.

We will give students up to $1,200 more, per year, by increasing Canada Student Grants by another 40 per cent, to help with the rising cost of tuition, books, and rent; and
We will give students two years after graduation to get started before they need to begin paying off their student loans, interest free.
We will change the rules so that, even after the two year grace period, graduates won’t have to start repaying their loans until they make at least $35,000, and can put their loans on hold if their income drops below this level; and
We will allow parents to pause student loan repayments — with no interest — until their youngest child reaches the age of five. This means more money to help pay for things like baby products and child care in those important, and expensive, first years.

“Like Doug Ford, Andrew Scheer will cut support for college and university students. But what the Conservatives fail to understand is that the greatest investment we can make in our future is in education and training,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We won’t make the same mistakes. On education. On the environment. On the economy. We will not fall back and fall behind. We will move forward, and choose to lead.”

Fredericton, NB — A re-elected Liberal government will increase Old Age Security by an extra ten per cent once a senior turns 75, and will boost the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit by 25 per cent.
Canadians are living longer than ever before, but as they age they face higher health care costs, and they’re worried about their savings running out. The number of seniors who rely on Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) payments — a monthly benefit that goes to the poorest seniors — goes up with age. Today, as many as 238,000 seniors live in poverty.
“Over the last four years, we’ve expanded benefits for older Canadians — helping lift 50,000 seniors out of poverty,” said Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “But we know many seniors still struggle to keep up with their bills as they age. After a lifetime of hard work, people should have peace of mind knowing their retirement savings won’t run out, and that their government will be there to help.”
A re-elected Liberal government will take meaningful action — working in partnership with provinces and territories — to further strengthen the supports that our seniors rely on every day:

We will put up to $729 more in the pockets of seniors each year, by increasing Old Age Security (OAS) by ten per cent once they turn 75. This will help lift more than 20,000 seniors out of poverty, of whom two-thirds will be women; and
We will give up to $2,080 in additional benefits, every year, to those who’ve lost a loved one, by increasing the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) survivor’s benefit by 25 per cent.

Since 2015, we have taken real action to help more Canadians retire with confidence, including:

Restoring the eligibility age for OAS and GIS benefits to 65 from 67;
Making the most significant enhancement to the CPP since its creation — which will raise the maximum CPP benefit by up to 50 per cent once fully rolled-out;
Giving single seniors nearly $1,000 more a year to help pay the bills, through our boost to the GIS top-up; and
Increasing the GIS earnings exemption, so that low-income seniors who choose to keep working can keep more of their hard-earned income.

“Andrew Scheer voted against lowering the OAS eligibility age from 67 to 65, which boosts seniors’ retirement savings by thousands of dollars and lets them retire earlier, so they can spend more time with their grandkids,” said Mr. Trudeau. “His party also pledged to reverse the changes we made to strengthen the CPP. Seniors deserve more from their government, and if re-elected, we will continue to work to make sure they have a safe, secure, and dignified retirement.”

Toronto, ON — A re-elected Liberal government will give families an extra $1,500 every year, by cutting taxes for the middle class and lowering cell phone bills by 25 per cent.
Middle class families are feeling stretched. Taxes, fees, and bills pile up while wages are not keeping up. Cell phone bills in particular put a lot of pressure on a family’s budget, with Canadians paying up to twice as much for wireless services than people in other G7 countries. Enough is enough. It’s time for hard-working Canadians to get a bigger share of the pie.
“I’ve been talking to Canadians across the country and I keep hearing the same thing: even with our strong economy and record unemployment, it’s still tough to make ends meet,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Groceries. Cell phone bills. Child care. It all adds up. And that’s what today is all about — being there for families when they need it most.”
To start, a re-elected Liberal government will:

Ensure middle class Canadians, and the people working to join the middle class, pay no federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn — saving the average family $585 in taxes each year;
This means that about 700,000 more Canadians, including seniors and young people starting their careers, will pay no federal tax at all;
And will lift about 40,000 Canadians out of poverty.

This will be done by raising the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) by almost $2,000 for people earning under $147,000 a year.
While Andrew Scheer’s tax plan would give a bigger break to wealthier Canadians, our plan lowers taxes the most for people who make less, helps the middle class, and ensures that the wealthy don’t get an extra hand up. Our tax cut would also help lift twice as many Canadians out of poverty than the Conservatives’.
A re-elected Liberal government will also reduce the cost of wireless services by 25 percent within four years, putting $1,000 back in the pockets of the average Canadian family every year. This will be done by:

Working with telecom companies to offer plans at globally comparable prices;
Encouraging Canadian competition in the market, and allowing the CRTC to step if that competition isn’t leading to lower prices; and
Prioritizing consumer choice and affordability, and not simply the highest bidder, when awarding new wireless expansions.

“The Conservatives spent a decade cutting taxes for corporations and millionaires,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Now, Andrew Scheer’s tax cut would benefit the wealthiest more than those who need it most. We know better. Millionaires don’t need another tax break. But the middle class does.”

Delta, B.C. – A re-elected Liberal government will help Canadians lower their energy bills, make their homes more energy-efficient, and give them the tools to prepare for climate related disasters.
Today, many Canadians live in homes that aren’t energy efficient – which means higher utility bills and more pollution. Meanwhile, more and more homes are in danger of being destroyed from the ever-increasing number of floods and wildfires. Climate change is real, and it’s happening now. As a country we must come together to fight it, and we also need to deal with its consequences.
“It’s expensive to adapt to a changing climate. We are going to help you replace those drafty windows or your old furnace – so you can cut your utility bills and keep our environment healthy,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We have a decision to make. We can go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change, or we can fight for a better future. The choice is that clear.”
A re-elected Liberal government will make life more affordable for Canadians, cut our emissions, and protect the environment.

We will help retrofit 1.5 million homes to help Canadians make their homes more energy efficient, and better protect them from climate-related risks;
We will help homeowners and landlords pay for retrofits by giving them an interest-free loan of up to $40,000;
We will help people buy newly built homes that are certified zero-emissions by giving them a Net Zero Homes Grant of up to $5,000; and
We will invest $100 million in skills training, to ensure there are enough qualified workers to keep up with energy audits, retrofits, and net-zero home construction.

We will also be there for Canadians when disaster strikes, by:

protecting homeowners who are at high risk of flooding and don’t have adequate insurance protection, by creating a low-cost national flood insurance program;
helping Canadians better understand the risks they face when they buy a home, by working with provinces and territories to complete all flood maps in Canada;
developing a national action plan to assist homeowners with potential relocation for those at the highest risk of repeat flooding; and
help Canadians whose jobs and livelihoods are affected when disaster strikes, by working with stakeholders and experts to design an E.I. Disaster Assistance Benefit.

These measures will build on four years of climate action by our government, including:

introducing over 50 measures to fight climate change and protect our environment, from banning single-use plastics to putting a price on pollution;
investing to encourage new homes to be built carbon neutral;
helping ensure Canadians have access to the most energy-efficient appliances to help cut energy costs and support our climate action goals; and
establishing the $2 billion Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund to help communities prevent and prepare for growing climate risks.

“Andrew Scheer doesn’t have a real climate plan. He wants to make pollution free again – which would increase our emissions,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Denial is not a policy. We can go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change – or fight for a better future. I’m for moving forward.”

“Conservatives say they’re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy, and cut services for everybody else,” says Navdeep Bains
Ottawa, ON – Today, the Hon. Navdeep Bains shared a video of Andrew Scheer speaking about his plan to subsidize wealthy private schools with hundreds of millions of federal tax dollars, and highlighted how this plan would take us backward to the failed Conservative policies of the past.
“Great public schools are the bedrock of Canada’s economy,” Bains said. “The Conservatives don’t get that. That’s why they’d weaken public education with a reckless plan to fund private schools and homeschooling, as this video makes clear.”
“Conservatives say they’re for the people, then they cut taxes for the wealthy, and cut services for everybody else. We’re for moving forward – for everyone.”

Clarenville, NL –  Liberals in Bonavista-Burin-Trinity have nominated Churence Rogers, an experienced community leader and Mayor of Centreville-Wareham-Trinity, as the official Team Trudeau candidate in the upcoming federal by-election. 

“After an exciting nomination race and voting held across the riding this week, we are honoured to welcome Churence Rogers to Team Trudeau as the Liberal candidate in this important by-election,” said Anna Gainey, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “Churence’s long record of public service demonstrates a deep commitment to supporting families in his community and throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, and I know he will be a tireless champion for Bonavista-Burin-Trinity in Parliament.”

Churence has a proven track record of fighting for a stronger middle class, and for every family working hard to join it.  Churence has served as Mayor of Centreville-Wareham-Trinity since 2009, and previously served as Mayor of Harbour Breton from 1997 to 2003.  

From 2011 to 2015, Churence also served as President of Municipalities Newfoundland and Labrador (MNL). Under his leadership, MNL negotiated a new fiscal framework arrangement with the provincial government that invested millions of dollars annually into municipalities across Newfoundland and Labrador, helping to improve the lives of families throughout the province.

“It’s an honour to be nominated by Liberals in Bonavista-Burin-Trinity to serve as our candidate in this by-election, and I will work hard to earn the trust and support of every family in our riding,” said Rogers. “After 10 years of Stephen Harper left too many families falling behind, I’m looking forward to working with Justin Trudeau to continue creating good new middle class jobs right here in our communities – and to offer real help to the hard working families who need it most.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Yom Kippur:
“Today at sunset, Jewish communities in Canada and around the world will come together to observe the start of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. A time of reflection, introspection, and repentance, this holiday will bring family and friends together tonight to fast and pray.
For all of us, Yom Kippur is a chance to honour the Jewish Canadian community, and to celebrate the important contributions of our neighbours and friends. In years to come, just like in years past, this community will continue creating a better Canada for everyone.
For many Jewish Canadians, Yom Kippur comes during a difficult year. In the wake of violent acts of hatred in Canada and beyond, this is a time to recommit to fighting antisemitism, hatred, and discrimination in every form. These acts have no place in our country or our world, and we must always stand united against them. Together, we can continue to build a more inclusive Canada where we celebrate the diversity that is our strength.
On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone observing Yom Kippur a Gmar Chatima Tova.”

Toronto, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new radio ad to highlight that a re-elected Liberal government will ban assault rifles and continue to take serious, common-sense action to strengthen gun control.
“I spent decades working to keep my city safe and I know that the presence of a gun in a dangerous situation can make it deadly,” said Bill Blair, former Toronto Chief of Police and Liberal candidate for Scarborough Southwest, in the new ad. “We are going to do something about it with stronger gun control laws and a ban on assault rifles. The Conservatives talk tough but they won’t do what needs to be done. Soon, you’ll have a choice. Let the Conservatives weaken our gun control laws or make your communities safer by making gun laws stronger.”
Gun crime in Canada is on the rise, and today, our country has no clear classification for assault rifles — making it legal to buy several military-style weapons. With Bill C-71, we took important steps to make our communities safer, but we need to continue to take serious, common-sense action to strengthen gun control.
“Too many people have lost loved ones to gun violence. And too often, the culprit is military-style weapons designed to inflict mass human casualties — guns so dangerous that they have no place in our country,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Thoughts and prayers aren’t going to cut it. A Liberal government will strengthen gun control, and ban assault weapons in Canada.”

Last week, we announced important steps a re-elected Liberal government will take to strengthen gun control in Canada, including:
banning all military-style assault rifles, including the AR-15;
working with the provinces and territories to give municipalities the ability to further restrict — or ban — handguns; and
protecting the rights of law-abiding hunters and pledge not to bring back the long-gun registry. Hunters do not use or need assault weapons;
preventing people suspected of posing a danger to themselves or others — including their partners or kids — from possessing or acquiring new firearms;
requiring that everyone importing ammunition must show proof of a valid firearms license; and
making it harder for legal weapons to fall into the hands of criminals, by further strengthening safe-storage laws.

“Andrew Scheer’s policy on guns was written by the gun lobby. He has an agenda that will make it easier for criminals to get their hands on assault rifles,” said Mr. Trudeau. “It is shameful. We want stronger gun laws. The Conservatives want weaker ones. The choice is clear.”

Ottawa, ON – Liberals released a new video today revealing Andrew Scheer briefed Conservatives about his deep cuts plan at a private meeting, including how he’ll conceal it during the election campaign.
Link: https://twitter.com/Bill_Morneau/status/1171065033889112064?s=20
“When it comes making tough decisions and cuts, I do agree that it’s very important. But we also have to be very, very careful how we communicate that to people. We do have to win the next election in 2019 and there are examples when Conservative parties go in and have a very hard-edged tone to it. We can make the case for spending cuts, absolutely.”
(Andrew Scheer, Conservative Leadership Candidate Meeting, Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, September 7, 2016)
“Andrew Scheer is committed to austerity and cuts, and he is purposely downplaying his cuts plan in order to get elected. Scheer said so to Conservatives at a private event,” said Liberal MP Bill Morneau. “Scheer’s plan to downplay his plan for deep cuts won’t work because Canadians know that Conservatives say they’re for the people, then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else.”
“What Andrew Scheer is saying in this video is exactly what Doug Ford did. Ford said one thing during the election, then made cuts to schools, libraries, public health agencies, and francophone services,” said Morneau. “Scheer has promised the same timelines for cuts as Doug Ford did: five years. Scheer just wont talk about it until after the election.”

MONTREAL, QC – Tonight, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, presented an ambitious plan to strengthen the middle class, protect the environment and grow the economy. In a few weeks, Canadians will have a choice: go back to the cuts and austerity of the Harper years, or move forward for a better future.
“We have to move forward because our planet is burning. We have to move forward because people are having a hard time making ends meet. We have to move forward because our culture, and fundamental rights like gender equality, are under threat,” said Justin Trudeau. “And to do so, we need to have Quebec represented in government.”
The debate made one thing clear: Andrew Scheer and Conservatives like Doug Ford and Jason Kenney have no plan for the environment. They reject science and want to go back to a time when pollution was free. Liberals know climate change is real, and we’re putting in place concrete solutions to fight the climate crisis, adapt to a warming planet, and protect our environment.
Justin Trudeau also underscored that a re-elected Liberal government will continue to invest in Canada’s cultural and creative industries. We will increase funding for Telefilm Canada, strengthen the regional mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada, and move forward with legislation to ensure internet giants promote Canadian content. Andrew Scheer will cut taxes for the wealthy by cutting funding for Canada’s cultural industry – just like Stephen Harper.
The debate was also a reminder that the Liberal Party is the party of Francophones. Andrew Scheer refused to stand up to Doug Ford when he cut services for Franco-Ontarians. He’s already shown us that he won’t defend Francophone rights.
Justin Trudeau also stressed that a diverse and open Canada is a stronger Canada. New Canadians help our communities succeed, and they also help address the labour shortage that threatens the growth of our economy.
“In a few weeks, Quebecers — and all Canadians — will have a choice. We can choose a party that’s unwilling to move forward, because it doesn’t share our values. We can choose a party that’s unable to move forward, because it’s aiming for the opposition. Or we can choose the Liberal party, and keep moving forward – for the environment, the middle class, and our fundamental rights. On October 21st, let’s choose forward, together.”

Toronto, ON – Ahead of remarks being given today by Andrew Scheer in Toronto. Liberal M.P. Ahmed Hussen highlighted the economic risk and the dangers of continued divisive rhetoric on immigration from Scheer and his Conservative Party.
“Andrew Scheer has embraced the same sort of extreme right wing anti-immigration rhetoric that has become pervasive among right-wing populist parties around the world,” said Liberal M.P. Ahmed Hussen. “Andrew Scheer has perpetuated false information about global efforts to manage immigration and he even appeared at the same rally where a well-known xenophobic anti-immigration activist spoke.”
“This is more of the same from Andrew Scheer and the Conservative Party that created massive wait times for family reunification and made reckless cuts to immigration and refugee programs that were called cruel and unusual treatment by the Federal Court,” said Hussen. “From stoking fear with snitch lines and cutting refugee health services, to running ads that peddle false information and outright conspiracy theories, Canadians know that Conservative politicians see immigration policy as a way to fear monger and divide Canadians.”
Our Liberal government sees immigration as an important economic policy. Study after study shows that immigration creates jobs, fills labour shortages and grows the economy. That is why we set up important programs like the Global Skills Strategy, the Student Direct Stream, the start-up visa program, Express Entry, the Atlantic Immigration Pilot, the Francophone Welcoming Communities and the Rural and Northern immigration pilot. These programs have brought in thousands of immigrants to fill labour shortages, establish new businesses in Canada and create opportunities for all Canadians. These policies have also made Canada the destination of choice for talented people from around the world as well as those seeking to invest in these talented people. Our plan has allowed for these people to create more jobs for Canadians and continue to grow the economy for years to come.
“After ten years of failed Conservative immigration policy, our Liberal government is restoring confidence in the immigration system by investing in the resources it needs to attract newcomers to our country, shorten wait times and provide fairness and equality for all,” said Hussen. “Canadians don’t want to go back to the old days and old divisive ways of Stephen Harper and that’s what Andrew Sheer has to offer.”

Mr. Yves Côté
Commissioner of Canada Elections
30 Victoria Street
Gatineau, Quebec
K1A 0M6
Dear Mr. Côté:
I write to draw your attention to a number of examples of partisan activities carried out by the Canadian Shooting Sports Association (CSSA) that appear to be in breach of the Elections Canada rules for third parties. I trust you will examine these possible violations of the new third party provisions contained in the Canada Elections Act (S.C. 2000, c.9).
On September 20, 2019, our Party’s leader, Mr. Justin Trudeau, announced that a re-elected Liberal government will take serious, common-sense action to strengthen gun control and crack down on gun crime. Specifically, if re-elected, we will ban all military-style assault rifles and also work with municipalities to give them the ability to further restrict or ban handguns. We will work with law enforcement to strengthen safe-storage laws and limit the glorification of violence by creating new rules on where and how guns are advertised, marketed, and sold in Canada.
We will continue to respect Canadian hunters, farmers, and sport shooters. We will not bring back the long-gun registry. Hunters neither use nor need assault weapons.
In response to this announcement, the CSSA disseminated a newsletter on September 23, 2019 that states: “With the 2019 federal election looming, the CSSA is putting its members’ money where its mouth is. We commissioned a series of videos in English and Mandarin with a simple message: if you use or own guns, you must vote in Election 2019.” The CSSA also encourages members to oppose their local Liberal candidate in the election.
Further to that, the CSSA states that its video commercials are “already running on Citytv and the Wild TV networks.”
As of September 25, 2019, the CSSA is not listed on the Elections Canada website as a registered third party for the purposes of the 43rd General Election, despite having apparently incurred more than $500 in regulated expenses. Additionally, the videos posted online, which the organization states are airing on television, do not bear the requisite authorization tag for election advertisements. This raises concerns with respect to the transparency of the third party advertiser.
I trust you will review the attached materials and consider our serious concerns from a compliance standpoint.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Yours sincerely,

Adam Vaughan
Liberal candidate for Spadina-Fort York

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on National Seniors Day:
“On National Seniors Day, we celebrate the people who have made Canada the place we know and love. Parents and grandparents, neighbours and friends – Canada’s seniors built this country, and their hard work and vision continue to lift our communities up. Whether it’s helping neighbours in need, or being there for us in the tough moments, seniors make Canada stronger every day.
Seniors have spent a lifetime helping others, and deserve to enjoy their golden years in comfort and dignity. Over the last four years, our Liberal government took action to make that a reality for seniors across Canada.
After the Harper government announced they would raise the age of eligibility for Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement to 67, we brought it back down to 65. We strengthened the Canada Pension Plan. And for the most vulnerable seniors, we boosted the Guaranteed Income Supplement – because no one, of any age, should have to worry about making ends meet.
We also invested in home care, and created the Canada Caregiver Credit to provide simpler and better support for people taking care of a loved one. And with a new Minister of Seniors, we are making sure the perspectives and needs of older Canadians are front and centre.
We know there is still more to do so that all seniors enjoy the secure retirement they deserve. Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will increase Old Age Security by an extra ten per cent at the age of 75, and will boost the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit by 25 per cent. These changes will help lift thousands of seniors out of poverty, and support people after they have lost a loved one.
Together, let’s choose forward, and keep working to make life better for people of every age, from coast to coast to coast. Today, let’s celebrate the seniors in our lives, and thank them for all that they have done, and all that they continue to do.”

« Blanchet qui utilise le segment sur les affaires autochtones pour parler juste du Québec. Pas fort. On en a aussi au Québec, des Premières nations. » – Mathieu Charlebois (L’Actualité), Twitter, 2 octobre, 2019
“Bernier asks if Scheer thinks he could impose [a] pipeline through Quebec, even if the province doesn’t want it. Bernier says he would impose it, and Scheer doesn’t have the courage to say that too.” – Alex Ballingall (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Shameless of Scheer to call PM “phony” and a “fraud” when he kept his dual passport a secret until forced to acknowledge.” – Damien Cox (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Scheer says that he would pay for his tax cuts and credits by cutting foreign aid and ending (some) corporate welfare. That’s misleading. Those two savings equal ~$3 billion a year. Scheer’s proposed income tax cut alone costs ~$6 billion a year.” – Alex Boutilier (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 7, 2019
“Claim: Trudeau says “We eliminated 87 long-term boil-water advisories in Indigenous communities and are on schedule to lift all that remain.” Verdict: True (to date). There were 105 long-term boil-water advisories on reserves when Trudeau took office. According to Indigenous Services Canada, as of Sept. 3, 2019, 87 have been eliminated. Budget 2019 provided $739 million over five years, and said it was on track to eliminate all by 2019.” – Hadyn Watters, CBC, October 7, 2019
“#AndrewScheer looks angry (…) it looks bad.” – Michael Coren, Journalist, Twitter, October 7, 2019
« Vérif: la pauvreté a bel et bien reculé chez les enfants canadiens, et la prestation libérale a aidé selon l’économiste Pierre Fortin. » – Paul Journet (La Presse), Twitter, 7 octobre, 2019
“Climate has brought out the most passionate version of Trudeau and is driving his clearest line of the night: that it’s between him and Scheer. That’s where the Liberals are putting their chips.” – Aaron Wherry (CBC), Twitter, October 7, 2019

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on World Teachers’ Day:
“On World Teachers’ Day, we recognize the mentors and guides who have helped us become the people we are today.
Everyone remembers the teacher who inspired them to find their passion, or who taught them lifelong values of hard work, perseverance, and integrity.
Being a teacher is about preparing kids to pursue their dreams, and helping them have confidence in their power to make a positive difference. They have an extraordinary impact because they never stop working for their students. That’s why, over the last four years, we have been there for our teachers, with everything from a tax benefit for teachers and early childhood educators, to investing in schools and Indigenous education across the country.
Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will keep moving forward, by creating more before and after school care spaces and making Canada Student Grants more generous.
This year’s theme – Young Teachers: The future of the Profession – reminds us not just of the remarkable teachers here in Canada, but of people around the world who are dedicated to giving their students the best possible start in life. Since 2015, Canada has been a leader in supporting education around the globe. At the G7 Leaders’ Summit, we mobilized a historic investment of almost $3.8 billion in education for women and girls in crisis and conflict situations. To build on this progress, we later welcomed an additional $527 million to help developing countries give every child access to quality education and modern skills training.
A re-elected Liberal government will continue this work, from spending no less than ten per cent of our international development assistance budget on education, to leading an international campaign to ensure all children living in refugee or displacement camps get a good education.
I am incredibly proud to have been a teacher, and to have worked alongside the people who go above and beyond to help every young person succeed. Today, let’s celebrate the teachers who change their students’ lives for the better, and create a brighter tomorrow for everyone.”

Papineau, QC – With eight weeks until Canadians head to the polls, Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada are launching an innovative new advertising and digital engagement campaign focused on the choice facing Canadians in October’s important election.
A series of new national ads featuring Justin Trudeau will begin airing on television this week, as part of a comprehensive and digitally-integrated advertising experience that also includes a large-scale online campaign, a new website, and featured stories from Canadians who have a personal connection to Canada’s progress since 2015. It also includes the launch of the Liberal Party of Canada’s official 2019 campaign theme: Choose Forward.
“The Conservatives like to say they’re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else,” says Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. “In October, we’ve got a choice to make: Keep moving forward and build on the progress we’ve made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years. I’m for moving forward — for everyone.”
Justin Trudeau highlights how Conservative politicians have consistently opposed the Liberal government’s progress to help people, including:

Raising taxes on the wealthiest one percent, so we could lower taxes for the middle class
Creating the Canada Child Benefit, which gives hundreds of dollars each month tax-free to families across Canada
A real plan to fight climate change that will reduce pollution and put more money in Canadians’ pockets

Canadians will have an important choice to make in this fall’s election. While Conservatives are focused on going backward with cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class.

Keswick, ON –  Liberals in York—Simcoe have nominated Shaun Tanaka, a devoted community leader, educator, and mother of two, as the official Team Trudeau candidate in the upcoming federal by-election.
“Shaun Tanaka knocked on thousands of doors as the Liberal candidate for York—Simcoe in 2015, and we are very proud to welcome her to Team Trudeau once again for this important by-election,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “Shaun’s deep roots in York—Simcoe give her a unique understanding of her community’s priorities and challenges, and I know she will never stop working hard to strengthen the middle class and continue growing our economy.”
Shaun was raised in the community and has always been actively engaged in making York—Simcoe an even better place to call home. She has dedicated many years of volunteer service to organizations such as the Sharon Temple Museum Society and the East Gwillimbury Public Library, along with the National Association of Japanese Canadians and the Maytree Foundation – a charitable organization committed to reducing poverty and inequality in Canada.
Shaun has also spent the past decade as a Geography professor, both at Queen’s University and the University of Toronto, educating students in urban studies, social, and cultural geography, in addition to operating a successful business with her husband, Sean.
“York—Simcoe needs a strong local voice in government who will stand-up for the priorities and needs of our community,” said Shaun Tanaka. “I’ll be working hard to earn every single vote, so together we can strengthen our middle class, grow our local economy, and offer real help to families.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Thanksgiving:
“Happy Thanksgiving!
Life can be hectic for all of us. And whether you’re holding it down in the kitchen or getting outside with the family, Thanksgiving is about slowing down and appreciating what really matters – like family, and friends we haven’t seen in a long time, but we pick right back up where we left off.
Thanksgiving is a chance to say thank you to the people who make a difference – whether it’s the service members who keep us safe, or our neighbour a few doors down who keeps the driveways plowed.
No one’s worried about the little things when there’s pumpkin pie to focus on. And what brings us together is so much bigger than what pulls us apart – from Canadian values, to universal health care, to the start of the hockey season. Wherever we are, being together is what counts.
We have a whole lot to be grateful for. After all, Canada’s home. We’ve got to take care of it. And that’s exactly what our team is going to do – whether it’s fighting climate change, supporting families, or putting more money in the pockets of the middle class.
On October 21st, the choice could not be more clear. So let’s do what Canadians always do. Let’s pull together and move forward.
From our family to yours, have a great Thanksgiving.”

Meadow Lake, SK – Justin Trudeau will join Tammy Cook-Searson and local Liberals for a Team Trudeau 2019 campaign event in Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, on May 23, 2019.
Tammy Cook-Searson has been involved in First Nations government and politics for over 22 years, and served 5 terms as Chief of the Lac La Ronge Indian Band. She is also the President of the Kitsaki Management Limited Partnership and a successful local entrepreneur. Tammy is part of a growing team of strong and experienced Team Trudeau candidates and Members of Parliament in Saskatchewan and across Canada.
Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are focused on a strong plan for Saskatchewan: to strengthen our middle class, grow the economy, invest in affordable housing and better roads and bridges, and protect a healthy environment for our kids and grandkids. Nearly 3,000 Saskatchewanians have already signed up as new Liberals since the last election, and that grassroots support is continuing to grow every day.

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Persons Day:
“Emily Murphy. Nellie McClung. Irene Parlby. Louise McKinney. Henrietta Muir Edwards. Known as the Famous Five, this group of determined Alberta women fought for years to gain women the right to serve as senators and be recognized as ‘persons’ under the law. They came together to challenge the status quo and push for a government that reflected the country it served.
On Persons Day, we celebrate the anniversary of a landmark victory for women’s rights and a turning point for democracy in Canada. The 1929 ruling opened the door to further progress, lending momentum to future generations who would continue to push for a more equal world.
Persons Day falls during Women’s History Month – a reminder that women have fought for change in the past, and continue to do so today. Advocates are carrying this work forward, and over the last four years, our Liberal government has stood with them. Whether it’s introducing Canada’s first gender-equal Cabinet, helping more women start their own business, combatting gender-based violence, or investing in education for the world’s most vulnerable women and girls, we’ve worked to move the dial on gender equality and build a more just, equal Canada for everyone. And from breaking down barriers in the workforce by offering guaranteed paid family leave, to investing in the organizations that fight for gender equality each day, we will keep putting gender equality at the heart of everything we do.
The Famous Five’s story also teaches us that we have to keep pushing forward – especially when the going gets tough. In 2019, we’ve seen an attack on women’s rights around the world, from the legitimization of gender-based violence, to the assault on a woman’s right to choose. Even in Canada, some politicians are intent on rolling back rights and cutting access to important services like health care and sexual assault centres. We can’t afford to lose ground on gender equality – but Persons Day shows us that if we work together, we can win the hardest battles. Today, let’s come together for a more equal world, and choose forward, for all of us.”

Ottawa, ON – The Liberal Party of Canada is heading into this fall’s election campaign supported by its best-ever second quarter for grassroots fundraising results, with more than 41,500 Canadians contributing $5,033,998 to support Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team’s progress to invest in the middle class.
A record-breaking Q2 builds on grassroots Liberals also recently achieving the party’s best-ever Q3 and Q4 fundraising results outside of an election campaign, and each of the last five months has set a new monthly best. The median donation to the Liberal Party in Q2 was just $15 at a time, and 95 percent of all donations were under $200.
“Liberals are starting this important election campaign with new records for grassroots fundraising and incredible hope and hard work by volunteers in communities across Canada,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “As we head to the polls this fall, Canadians will have a clear choice. While Conservatives want to go backward with divisive politics and cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class.”
Filings with Elections Canada also continue to highlight that Liberal supporters are getting far more value for their donations than Conservatives. Annual returns since the last campaign show that the Conservative Party spent $22,519,872 on fundraising expenses throughout 2016-2018, while the Liberal Party spent just $9,254,606.
The Liberal Party was also the first and only party to move forward with the strongest standards in federal politics for open and transparent political fundraising events. This is in clear contrast to the Conservative Party and the NDP, who have continued to bar journalists and keep Canadians in the dark about what is being said behind closed doors.
Throughout this mandate, local Liberal riding associations have also continued to outraise their Conservative counterparts by as much as 3-to-1.

Gatineau, QC – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new ad highlighting how a re-elected Liberal government will move forward with Quebecers and all Canadians to build a better future.
“We want to move forward,” says one woman featured in the new ad.
“We want a country that protects a woman’s right to choose,” other participants say. “We want a country that puts the environment first, that invests in public transit. A country that helps families and lowers our taxes.”
In less than two weeks, Canadians will make a choice about the future of our country. That choice could not be more clear. Do we:

Protect a woman’s right to choose, or roll back the progress we’ve made on gender equality?
Fight the climate crisis with a serious plan, or leave the problem to our kids and grandkids?
Invest in families, or let the Conservatives cut everything we care about?
Keep cutting taxes for the middle class, or give tax breaks to big polluters and the wealthiest one percent?

A re-elected Liberal government will keep moving forward to make life more affordable for Canadians. Our plan will help people:

Save nearly $600 a year, per family, thanks to our tax cut that helps the middle class, not the richest one percent;
Save $1,000 a year on their family’s cell phone plans when we lower bills by 25 per cent;
See their aging parents’ Old Age Security go up by ten per cent once they turn 75, increasing by up to $729 each year;
Save hundreds of dollars a month on mortgage payments if they’re buying their first home;
Get an interest-free loan of up to $40,000, and hundreds of dollars in incentives, if they want to retrofit their home and save more money on bills;
Save on medications their family needs when we implement Universal Pharmacare;
Save $800 a year when we lower fees for before and after school child care by ten percent;
Get up to $1,000 more to help with the costs of raising a newborn when we boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one; and
Get more money when we make maternity and parental benefits tax-free, and get 15 weeks of paid leave if they adopt.

“Over the last four years, we’ve put Canada on the path of progress. And we’re not stopping now,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, in the ad. “On October 21st, I’m choosing forward – for everyone.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day of Democracy:
“In every election, we get to make a choice about the future of our country. We get to decide what we want to achieve, and who we want to be as Canadians. As members of a democracy, this is our right and our responsibility. All of us can directly shape the future we want to see – for our families, our communities, and all our fellow Canadians.
“On the International Day of Democracy, we celebrate the democratic tradition that empowers us all and keeps Canada moving forward.
“Yet around the world, in 2019, democracy is increasingly under attack. And in recent years, we’ve seen an assault on journalists and the free press – the beating heart of democracy worldwide.
“It’s up to all of us to not only safeguard our democracy, but to strengthen it. That means using our vote to make our voices heard – but casting our ballot is just the beginning. From taking part in a town hall meeting, to helping our kids learn how their government works, we build our democracy together every day. The smallest of actions count.
“This fall, Canadians will once again get to vote for the kind of Canada they want to live in. While some politicians threaten to pull us backward, Canadians will have the choice to keep moving forward. We have spent the last four years building toward better. Now, we have the chance to continue that progress, together.
“Today, I urge Canadians to celebrate the power and responsibility we have – thanks to our democracy – to shape our country and our world. Let’s make the most of it, stand united, and choose forward – for all of us.”

2019 TVA Face-to-Face Debate.

Last night, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau underscored the choice Canadians have to make on October 21: keep moving forward with the progress achieved over the past four years or go back to the politics of the Harper years. And the responses keep coming in.

Il a été en mesure de le faire sans trébucher, en réussissant à envoyer quelques attaques.

« À l’issue du premier débat des chefs en français, le chef du Parti conservateur du Canada, Andrew Scheer, a choisi de maintenir un flou sur sa position personnelle en matière de droit à l’avortement. Questionné à ce sujet en point de presse, M. Scheer a quelque peu dérogé à la phrase qu’il répète inlassablement pour assurer qu’il ne rouvrira pas ce débat. » – Roxanne Ocampo, La Presse Canadienne, 3 oct 2019
« Le premier débat des chefs aura souvent placé Andrew Scheer dans les câbles mercredi soir : que ce soit par rapport à ses positions sur des enjeux sociaux ou sur la question environnementale, il a essuyé sa part de coups de la part de ses trois adversaires qui ont tenté de dépeindre le chef conservateur comme étant en porte-à-faux des valeurs québécoises. » – Guillaume Bourgault-Côté et Hélène Buzzetti, Le Devoir, 3 oct 2019

Toronto (ON) — A re-elected Liberal government will ban assault weapons and strengthen gun control in Canada.
Gun crime in Canada is on the rise. In 2017, there were 2,500 more victims of gun violence than in 2013, and many of these incidents involved intimate partners. Today, Canada has no clear classification for assault rifles — making it legal to buy several military-style weapons.
“Too many people have lost loved ones to gun violence. And too often, the culprit is military-style weapons designed to inflict mass human casualties — guns so dangerous that they have no place in Canada,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Thoughts and prayers aren’t going to cut it. A Liberal government will ban assault weapons in Canada.”
A re-elected Liberal government will build on the important measures we passed in Bill C-71, and continue to take serious, common-sense action to crack down on gun crime:

We will ban all military-style assault rifles, including the AR-15;
We will work with the provinces and territories to give municipalities the ability to further restrict — or ban — handguns; and
We will protect the rights of law-abiding hunters and pledge not to bring back the long-gun registry. Hunters do not use or need assault weapons.

We will also take concrete steps — in partnership with our law enforcement agencies — to strengthen gun control.

We will prevent people suspected of posing a danger to themselves or others — including their partners or kids — from possessing or acquiring new firearms;
We will require that everyone importing ammunition must show proof of a valid firearms license; and
We will make it harder for legal weapons to fall into the hands of criminals, by further strengthening safe-storage laws.

Over the last four years, our government took strong action to reduce gun violence:

We reversed the gun laws introduced by Stephen Harper that made it easier to purchase and transfer a weapon;
We started requiring firearm retailers to conduct more extensive background checks; and
We gave provinces and territories more resources to combat gun and gang violence, by investing nearly $330 million through our comprehensive, national Guns and Gangs Strategy.

“Andrew Scheer’s policy on guns was written by the gun lobby. He has an agenda that will make it easier for criminals to get their hands on assault rifles,” said Mr. Trudeau. “It is shameful. It’s time to end gun violence in Canada.”

Ottawa, ON – The following is a statement from Rodger Cuzner, Liberal M.P. for Cape Breton—Canso:
—
“The 2019 Manning Networking Conference kicks off today with an agenda that includes the Conservative Party returning to many of its usual topics: the demonization of immigrants, a refusal to denounce far-right extremists, and making pollution free again. Here are some highlights of their 3-day event:

Today, the conference will begin with a short speech from Preston Manning who has said he supports pollution pricing “wholeheartedly”. Unfortunately, Andrew Scheer refuses to believe the science, despite having started his political career working for Manning.
On Saturday morning, Doug Ford’s speech will segue into a pro-pollution rally on Parliament Hill. This event comes just one month after the Yellow Vest Convoy at the same location, attended by Andrew Scheer and Faith Goldy – who has been widely described as a ‘white nationalist.’
In the afternoon, Andrew Scheer’s speech will be followed by a session entitled “New Approaches to Tackling Climate Change”. This will feature economist Ross McKitrick, a climate change denier with no scientific credentials who states that climate action isn’t cost-effective and that CO2 emissions are beneficial to the environment.
On Sunday, a conservative columnist and one of Doug Ford’s failed candidates will participate in a discussion entitled “Can Canadian History Be Saved from the Mob?” Between them, they have an extensive track record of questionable commentary. Among a long list of controversies, the columnist is probably best known for a series of editorials in which she decried Quebec as “the most anti-Israel of all the provinces” and as a sanctuary for Hezbollah – while Ford’s failed candidate is known for promoting the belief that businesses and schools should be legally permitted to only serve specific ethnicities.

“Once again, it’s disappointing to see that the Conservatives are failing to address issues important to Canadians. Their refusal to put forward a plan to tackle climate change, combined with their refusal to denounce violent extremism, shows just how out of touch they are.  Our Liberal government will continue to confront these important issues head-on and strive for a better and stronger Canada.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day of Peace:
“Today, on the International Day of Peace, we celebrate global efforts to make peace a reality around the world. We honour the advocates who are on the frontlines of that work, and come together to build a more just, equal, and peaceful future.
This year’s theme, ‘Climate Action for Peace,’ reminds us that there’s no peace without justice – and no justice without climate justice. We’re all connected, and lasting, sustainable peace must include fighting the climate crisis and building more equal, resilient communities around the world.
Canada has a long and proud history as a voice for human rights around the globe, and a leader in international efforts to advance peace. Since 2015, Canada has made major strides to build on that leadership. Canadian peacekeepers have served in UN missions from Mali to Uganda to Haiti, helping communities around the globe build lasting peace and security. In 2017, Canada led the creation of the Vancouver Principles – now endorsed by nearly 100 countries – to end the recruitment and use of child soldiers and protect children around the globe.
When women participate meaningfully in peace processes, they help build more lasting peace. That’s why, together with our UN partners, we launched the Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace Operations, to boost women’s participation in conflict prevention, stabilization, and peacebuilding efforts. And last year, together with our partners, we delivered a historic investment in women and girls’ education in crisis and conflict situations – the largest of its kind ever made.
There’s much more to be done, and all of us have a role to play to build a more just and equal world, and a more peaceful, prosperous future. Together, let’s choose forward, advance peace and justice, and make our world a better one – today, and for generations to come.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty:
“On International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, we come together to fight poverty and build a more just and equal future for people everywhere.
This year’s theme, Acting Together to Empower Children, their Families, and their Communities to End Poverty, highlights the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. No kid should grow up hungry, or without a safe place to live – but this is the reality for many of the world’s most vulnerable children. We need to do more to change that, and that’s why we’re working to break the cycles of poverty by investing in education at home and around the world. Under our G7 presidency, we worked with partners to announce a historic investment of $3.8 billion in education for women and girls in conflict and crisis situations – the largest of its kind ever made. Building on this success, we later welcomed another investment of $527 million, to help developing countries give every child access to quality education and modern skills training. And a few weeks ago, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will commit at least ten per cent of our international assistance to education, and lead global efforts to make sure kids growing up in refugee or displacement camps get the education they need and deserve.
Here in Canada, our Liberal government has worked hard to fight poverty and support kids and families. With measures like the Canada Child Benefit and the Poverty Reduction Strategy, our Liberal government lifted 900,000 people out of poverty – including 50,000 seniors and 300,000 kids. Unemployment is at its lowest since the 1970s – and since 2015, Canadians have created over a million new jobs. And that’s because we rejected Conservative cuts and austerity, and chose instead to invest in the middle class and people working hard to join it.
We’ve put more money in people’s pockets by cutting taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest one percent. We stopped sending child benefit cheques to millionaires, so we could send more to the single parent working two jobs, or the family of five who falls a bit short at the end of the month. We made the Canada Pension Plan even stronger, because in a country like ours, seniors shouldn’t struggle to make ends meet.
This kind of progress has been possible because Canadians chose a government that was willing to invest in people and families. The International Day for Eradication of Poverty reminds us how important that work is – and how much more we need to do to make life better for the most vulnerable. On October 21st, Canadians will once again make a choice about our future. Let’s stand united, choose forward, and keep building a better Canada for everyone.”

Ottawa, ON – In October, Canadians have a choice to make about the future of our country: keep moving forward and building on the progress we’ve made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years.
In 2015, after a decade of failed Conservative policy, Canada’s economy was sputtering. Economic growth, job creation, and wages were all stalled – thanks to a Conservative government that believed you could cut your way to prosperity.
“Canadians were tired of a Harper government that promised prosperity, and delivered the opposite. So in 2015, they chose a team that was willing to invest in people and their communities. We live in the best country in the world, but better is always possible,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “And while there’s more work ahead of us than behind us, we have spent the last four years building toward better – and we’ve got the record to show for it.”
Over the last four years, our Liberal government made investments that made a real difference in people’s lives:

We’ve put more money in people’s pockets by cutting taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest one percent;
We stopped sending child benefit cheques to millionaires, so we could send more to the single parent working two jobs, and to the family of five that falls a bit short at the end of the month;
We made the Canada Pension Plan even stronger, because in a country like ours, seniors shouldn’t struggle to make ends meet; and
We’re protecting our nature, and ensuring that our air stays clean and our water stays safe – because we owe it to our kids, and to ourselves, to take care of our environment.

Since 2015, Canadians have created over a million new jobs. The new Canada Child Benefit is helping parents pay for healthier groceries, summer camp, and school supplies. We’ve lifted 900,000 Canadians out of poverty – and that includes over 300,000 kids. And this fall, Canadians once again get to vote for the kind of Canada they want to live in.
“Conservatives like to say they’re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Our government has chosen to move Canada forward by investing in families, workers, and communities. On October 21st, let’s stand united, and let’s choose forward – for a stronger middle class, and for a better Canada for all Canadians.”

Ottawa, ON — A re-elected Liberal government will immediately commit Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050, and will help workers prepare for the clean energy transition.
Today, Liberal candidates Catherine McKenna, Jonathan Wilkinson, and Steven Guilbeault announced that a re-elected Liberal government would immediately commit Canada to achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century, joining 65 other countries and the European Union that made the pledge at the United Nations Climate Summit on Monday. Net-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but these emissions would be offset by other actions — such as planting trees.
“The planet is burning and people are taking to the streets to demand stronger action to fight climate change,” said Liberal candidate from Laurier—Sainte-Marie, Steven Guilbeault. “The science is clear, the evidence is clear and Canadians are clear — we must step up and do even more to protect our environment. Our kids and grandkids are counting on us.”
That’s why a re-elected Liberal government will take concrete steps to lower emissions and make life more affordable for Canadians.

We will set legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to reach net-zero emissions by 2050;
We will appoint a group of scientists, economists, and experts to recommend the best path to get to net-zero;
We will exceed Canada’s 2030 emissions goal; and
We will ensure energy workers and communities can shape their own futures by introducing a Just Transition Act, giving workers access to the training, support, and new opportunities needed to succeed in the future economy.

“It is time for Canada to join governments and leading businesses around the world that have committed to net zero emissions by 2050 in order to further tackle the worsening climate crisis,” said Liberal candidate from Ottawa-Centre, Catherine McKenna. “We know that the strongest economies and businesses in the future will be those that embrace clean technologies. We will ensure that all Canadian workers are part of this transition to a cleaner, more prosperous and more sustainable future.”
These commitments build on the Liberals’ climate record that already includes over 50 measures to cut pollution and protect our environment. These include:

Banning harmful single-use plastics and microbeads;
Phasing out coal power by 2030 and investing in renewables like wind and solar;
Putting a price on carbon pollution so it’s no longer free to pollute anywhere in Canada, while putting more money back into Canadians’ pockets;
Building 1,200 public transit projects across the country;
Making zero-emission vehicles more accessible and affordable; and
Investing in energy efficiency to help families and businesses save money.

“Climate change represents an existential threat, but also an economic opportunity for countries that foster technologies that address greenhouse gas emissions,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, the Liberal candidate for North Vancouver. “We are committed to addressing this threat. Andrew Scheer, on the other hand, will do less and cost Canadians more in a plan that experts say will increase carbon pollution. We must do better.”

MONTRÉAL (QC) — A re-elected Liberal government will continue to protect and grow our cultural and creative industries, and make sure more people have access to our culture.
Whether it’s the writers who tell our stories, the comedians who make us laugh, or the artists who give us the soundtrack to our lives, Canadians are proud of the creativity we share – here at home and with the rest of the world. Meanwhile, to help bring people together, it’s vital that we preserve Canadian heritage by protecting and maintaining the places that have marked our country’s history.
“Culture is on the investment list for the Liberal Party. For the Conservatives, it’s on the list of things to cut,” said Pablo Rodriguez, the Liberal candidate for Honoré–Mercier. “Culture is who we are – past, present, and future. A Liberal government will always protect and promote culture and our official languages.”

To make sure more people have access to Canadian culture, at home and around the world, and to make sure our artists can keep telling our stories, we will:
create the Culture Pass, a $200 credit that every kid will receive at age 12, to be used to discover local Canadian content;
continue to support Canadian film by increasing annual funding for Telefilm Canada by nearly 50 per cent a year;
strengthen the regional mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada, so that local stations can broadcast more local news, and
require CBC/Radio-Canada to open up its digital platform, so that journalism start-ups and community newspapers can access affordable technology to develop and distribute local content;
introduce a new Cultural Diplomacy strategy, with at least one international mission each year to promote our culture and creators around the world; and
move forward, in our first year, with legislation to ensure that all content providers – including internet giants – offer meaningful levels of Canadian content in their catalogues, contribute to the creation of Canadian content in both official languages, and promote this content on their platforms.

“Our cultural industry is at a crossroads, and it just can’t afford a Conservative mandate,” said Annie Talbot, the Liberal candidate for Portneuf–Jacques-Cartier. “It’s 2019, but our main culture and communications laws are still from before the internet. The work Janet Yale and her team are doing to examine these laws is essential. We’re looking forward to reading her final report, and if Canadians give us another mandate, we’ll quickly take the necessary measures once the report is delivered.”
“I’m deeply proud to be part of a team that stood up to the Trump administration during the NAFTA negotiations to save the cultural exemption. Meanwhile, Andrew Scheer asked the government to make concessions to get a deal more quickly,” said Geneviève Hinse, the Liberal candidate for Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie. “You can be certain that a re-elected Liberal government will keep standing up for culture.”

Montréal, QC — A re-elected Liberal government will plant two billion trees, using the power of nature to help fight climate change and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
Canada’s vast forests, grasslands, and wetlands help clean our air, safeguard our water, and provide crucial wildlife habitat. But just as nature is under threat by climate change, it can also be a critical ally in the fight against it. Natural climate solutions like planting trees and protecting grasslands can also help get Canada significantly closer to reaching its emissions-reduction targets.
“Nature isn’t just part of our identity as Canadians. It’s part of the solution to climate change. And it’s a solution we can start using today,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “Trees are a fundamental part of a cleaner future. They’re renewable. They’re sustainable. And, eventually, they recycle themselves. All we have to do is plant the first one.”
A re-elected Liberal government will use the power of nature to fight climate change:

We will launch an ambitious program to plant two billion trees over ten years, as part of a $3 billion effort to deploy natural climate solutions.
This program will also take concrete action to conserve and restore Canada’s forests, grasslands, agricultural lands, wetlands, and coastal areas;
We will support about 3,500 seasonal jobs in tree planting;
We will help cities expand and diversify their urban forests; and
We will protect Canada’s trees from infestations, and help rebuild our forests after a wild-fire.

This builds on a strong Liberal record of protecting the environment, including:

Committing to increase Canada’s land and ocean conservation to 25 per cent by 2025 and 30 per cent by 2030;
Making the largest investment in nature conservation in Canada’s history — $1.35 billion in protecting more land and waters, and supporting species at risk.

“When Doug Ford took an axe to Ontario’s tree planting programs and the seasonal jobs it supported, we took a stand,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We can either go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change — or fight for a better future. I’m for moving forward.”

Victoria, BC – A re-elected Liberal government will help Canadians buy their first home.
For many young people starting their careers, saving up enough to make a down payment on a home is a far-off dream at best – and for ten years, Stephen Harper’s Conservatives did nothing to address these systemic problems. In the greater Toronto, Vancouver, and Victoria regions, people are facing these challenges head on, with housing prices up to sixty per cent higher than the national average.
“Many young Canadians dream of owning their first home. But with rising prices – and not enough homes to meet the demand – it’s getting harder and harder to make that dream a reality,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau. “Again and again, the Liberal government has stepped up to solve these challenges. Today, we’re announcing another important step to help Canadians buy their first home.”
In recent years, housing speculation by foreign owners has become a major challenge, driving up housing prices for people across the country. Canada is no place for those who wish to purely speculate in the housing market, and we need a national approach to protect families who are being priced out of buying a first home.
A re-elected Liberal government will:

fully implement the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, which provides Canadians with up to ten per cent off the purchase price of their first home;
immediately expand the Incentive to provide more help to communities in the greater Toronto, Vancouver, and Victoria regions by allowing homes valued at up to $789K to qualify;
address the impact of foreign speculation, which drives up housing costs, by putting in place a consistent national speculation and vacancy tax for non-resident, non-Canadians.

In addition to introducing the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, our Liberal government also:

launched Canada’s first-ever National Housing Strategy, a ten-year plan that will help more than 600,000 Canadians find safe and affordable places to live;
funded the construction of nearly 140,000 more housing units to be built by 2028; and
created the new Canada Housing Benefit to help 300,000 Canadians with the high costs of rent.

“The Conservatives voted against the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive and have no plan to help address the real concerns Canadians have about being able to own their own home,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Liberals believe in investing in people and in communities, which is why we are taking these steps to make homeownership an achievable dream, not just a privilege for the richest few.”

Hamilton, ON – A re-elected Liberal government will make sure every Canadian has access to a family doctor, to mental health services, to affordable prescription drugs, and to national pharmacare.
Canada’s health care system is a source of pride, but too many people still slip through the cracks. Today, nearly five million Canadians have no access to a family physician or a primary care team. All of us know someone who has gone through a mental health issue – but many people can’t get the help they need because it costs too much or the wait time is too long. And nearly one million Canadians skimp on food and heat to be able to pay for the medications they depend on, from insulin to inhalers.
“No one should go without the care they need because they don’t have access to a family doctor. And no one should have to give up food and heat to be able to pay for health care – whether it’s insulin, inhalers, or mental health support,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We’re going to close the gaps in the health care system, and make sure people can get the care they need, when they need it most.”
A re-elected Liberal government will make sure Canadians can afford and access lifesaving health care.
We will improve people’s access to health care by:

ensuring that every Canadian can easily find a family doctor or primary care team;
setting clear national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get the support they need quickly, when they need it most; and
continuing to make home care and palliative care more available to those who need it.

We will make sure everyone can afford the medications they need by:

implementing Universal Pharmacare, so that all Canadians have the drug coverage they need at an affordable price;
establishing the Canada Drug Agency to make drug purchasing more effective and efficient, and implementing a national formulary with partners to set prices; and
bringing down the cost of lifesaving high-cost drugs for families through the Rare Disease Drug Strategy.

Our government has made some of the most needed, significant changes to Canada’s health care system in decades. Over the past four years, we have:

helped more people access home care and mental health care through new health agreements with all the provinces and territories, allocating $11 billion in new funding;
undertaken the most comprehensive overhaul of drug pricing in thirty years, which will save Canadians approximately $13 billion over the next decade;
invested $500 million a year towards the creation of a rare disease drug strategy; and
taken the first steps to building a national pharmacare system.

“In the future, the federal government will have to negotiate with the provinces and territories, as has always been the case, to reach new health accords,” said Mr. Trudeau. “When that time comes, who do you want at the negotiation table, standing up to Doug Ford? Andrew Scheer, who follows his lead – or our Liberal team, who will fight for you?”

Ottawa, ON – The following is a statement from the Hon. Patty Hajdu, Liberal M.P. for Thunder Bay-Superior North:
“The Conservatives confirmed today they would follow Doug Ford and Stephen Harper’s lead by pushing for drastic cuts to services Canadians rely on.
“Lisa Raitt was specifically asked what the Conservatives would cut, and she pointed to Doug Ford’s Ontario and Stephen Harper’s record as a model to follow.
“The Conservatives are taking inspiration from Ford’s slashing of francophone services, children’s education, universities, and after-school programs. And the Harper government cut more than 25,000 public service jobs.
“Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives need to make drastic cuts so they can cut taxes for their wealthy friends, just like Conservatives always do.
“Prime Minister Trudeau has delivered real change that helps the middle class and those working hard to join it. We’ve introduced the Canada Child Benefit, which gives more money to 9 out of 10 Canadian families. We’ve cut taxes for the middle class while raising taxes on the wealthiest Canadians and we reached an agreement with the provinces to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan.
“The plan that we have been implementing over the last three years is working. Canada’s unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in over 40 years. More than 800,000 jobs have been created, giving more people the chance to get out of poverty, and start building a new life for themselves.
“We will keep fighting for our families, for our communities, and for a better future for all Canadians.”

Ottawa, Ontario – In response to Andrew Scheer’s speech today regarding Canadian Confederation, Bill Morneau, Liberal M.P. for Toronto Centre, issued the following statement:
_____________
“Today’s speech from Andrew Scheer is yet another example of the Conservatives misrepresenting what our Government has already done, while overpromising on things that they know they can’t deliver for Canadians.
“He promised to convene a First Ministers’ Meeting with a focus on Internal Trade. If that sounds familiar, it’s because our Government did that last December. He promised to appoint a Minister responsible for Internal Trade. We appointed the Hon. Dominic LeBlanc to that role in July 2018.
“Scheer used his speech to tell us about his already announced energy corridor, but failed to explain how forcing energy projects on provinces and territories lines up with his commitment to respect their jurisdiction.
“Finally, there were promises to respect decisions made by other orders of government, but that strains credibility when the Harper government that Andrew Scheer was an integral part of refused to meet with the Premiers, turned its back on the urgent infrastructure needs of municipalities, and failed to make First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation concerns a priority.
“Our Government, by contrast, works hard to build relationships across the country – between different orders of government and between Canadians. We hold regular meetings with First Ministers to discuss federal issues – and we actually show up. Even when difficult issues like equalization are on the table.
“Every year, we meet with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation leadership to talk about how we can build a stronger country, together. We have been able to build consensus between the provinces and territories on important things like renewing health accords and strengthening the Canada Pension Plan for current and future generations of Canadians.
“Much like Andrew Scheer’s long-promised climate plan, what’s most notable might be what was left unsaid. Today, there was no commitment from the Conservatives to hold annual First Ministers’ Meetings. No commitment to appoint bilingual judges. No commitment to work with provinces and territories to combat climate change. No commitment to meet regularly with Indigenous leaders. In fact, at a time when Canada is working towards reconciliation, Andrew Scheer’s only references to Indigenous Peoples was in the context of resource projects.
“One thing is clear today – whether on foreign policy, the economy, immigration, or now, the future of the federation, Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have no credible plan. There is no strength in disunity, and that’s all Andrew Scheer put in the window today.”

Ottawa, ON– The following is a statement from the Hon. Navdeep Bains, Liberal M.P. for Mississauga—Malton:
—
“Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives will make deep cuts to services that Canadians rely on so they can give tax breaks to the wealthy. The only people whose lives would be more affordable under the Conservatives are the super-rich.
“Right wing populists like Andrew Scheer and Doug Ford say they’re for the people while campaigning, then cut taxes for the wealthy and services the middle class depends on as soon as they’re elected.
“He talks about affordability, but time and time again, Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives have voted against policies that help the middle class.
“They voted against giving more money to families with the Canada Child Benefit, against cutting taxes for the middle class, and against a stronger Canada Pension Plan.
“Prime Minister Trudeau has delivered real change that helps the middle class and those working hard to join it. We’ve introduced the Canada Child Benefit, which gives more money to 9 out of 10 Canadian families. We’ve cut taxes for the middle class while raising taxes on the wealthiest Canadians and we reached an agreement with the provinces to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan.
“The plan that we have been implementing over the last three years is working. Canada’s unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in over 40 years. More than 800,000 jobs have been created, giving more people the chance to get out of poverty, and start building a new life for themselves.
“We will keep fighting for Canadian families and for a better future for all Canadians.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Small Business Week, which runs from October 20 to 26, 2019:
“On Small Business Week, we celebrate the local business owners and entrepreneurs who make our country such a great place to live.
Small and medium sized businesses grow our economy, create jobs, and help Canada thrive. Behind every small business is an entrepreneur – dedicated Canadians who dream big, work hard, and move our country forward. In the last four years, they’ve helped push unemployment to historic lows and create over a million new jobs for Canadians. From mom & pop shops to small home-based startups to growing mid-sized companies, Canada’s entrepreneurs are the backbone of our economy and our communities.
That’s why our Liberal government has worked hard every day to help our entrepreneurs get ahead. From reducing the small business tax rate to the lowest in the G7, to helping more people start their own business with the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, our Liberal government has made supporting small businesses a top priority. From CETA to the CPTPP, we signed a record number of trade deals, helping our businesses compete in markets around the world. We stood firm during the NAFTA renegotiations, to defend our trade relationship with Canada’s largest trading partner. And when Conservatives wanted to make concessions and settle for less, we fought – and won – to protect Canadian jobs and get a good deal for our workers and the many businesses throughout the supply chain that employ them.
We still have work to do. Today, nearly one in five entrepreneurs say it’s still a challenge to get the financing they need from traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions. To help more Canadians start and grow a business, a re-elected Liberal government will create the Canada Entrepreneur Account, administered through the Business Development Bank of Canada, to provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs with as much as $50,000 each year to launch their new businesses.
To make it easier for our small and medium-sized businesses to succeed, we’ll cut the cost of federal incorporation by 75 per cent, eliminate all fees from certain business advisory services, and eliminate the “swipe fee” on HST and GST for credit transactions – which will save businesses nearly $500 million a year in fees. And to help small businesses reach new customers around the world, we will make sure every Canadian business has access to reliable, high-speed internet by 2030, including in rural, remote, and northern communities.
In the last four years, Canada’s entrepreneurs and business owners have built a strong economy and laid the foundation for a better future. And this progress has been possible because our Liberal government rejected Conservative cuts and austerity – and chose instead to invest in the middle class and people working hard to join it. Tomorrow, Canadians will have a choice to make, and that choice couldn’t be more clear: go backwards with cuts to services and support, or choose forward together for a more prosperous future. Let’s do something small business owners do every day – roll up our sleeves and move forward.”

Montréal, QC – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new TV ad to highlight that a re-elected Liberal government will continue to advance gender equality and promote women’s rights.
“As women, we have a lot to be proud of, in a country where we embrace our differences, and where we’ve protected a woman’s right to choose. And when we’re proud, we choose forward,” said Mélanie Joly, Liberal candidate for Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Valérie Renaud-Martin, Liberal candidate for Trois-Rivières, and Chantal Pilon, Liberal candidate for Rimouski-Neigette-Témiscouata-Les Basques in the new ad.
Last week, we announced important measures that a re-elected Liberal government will take to support women, including creating hundreds of thousands of new before and after school care spaces, nearly doubling federal spending on child care, and moving forward to deliver Guaranteed Paid Family Leave for every new parent in Canada. Because child care still falls disproportionately to women, these measures represent an important step forward for gender equality and will make a difference for families across Canada.
“Our Liberal government has put gender equality at the heart of our work since day one. And whether it’s here at home or beyond our borders, we’ve made important progress,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “But there’s so much more to do – and we’re going to keep working together to build a more equal Canada and a better world.”
Over the last four years, the Liberal government took historic steps to advance the rights of women, girls, and people of all gender identities.

We passed unprecedented pay equity legislation;
We took action to promote women’s leadership on boards and in the C-suite;
We boosted support for women entrepreneurs with a plan to double the number of women entrepreneurs by 2025;
We created the first ever federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence;
We created more than 7,000 shelter spaces for survivors of family violence through our National Housing Strategy;
We launched Canada’s first Feminist International Assistance Policy;
We announced an unprecedented investment to protect the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls everywhere, including universal access to family planning, contraception, comprehensive sexuality education, and access to safe and legal abortion and post-abortion care; and
We passed legislation that added gender identity and expression as a protected ground in the Canada Human Rights Act.

“Whether it’s health care or support for survivors of sexual assault, the Conservatives want to slash access to vital services and roll back the clock on women’s rights,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We can’t take the progress we’ve made for granted. We have to stand united, work together, and choose forward on gender equality.”

Ottawa, ON – The Liberal Party of Canada has achieved a record-breaking third quarter for support from grassroots donors, with a new Q3 high of 53,341 Canadians chipping in $7,276, 261 to support Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team’s plan to invest in the middle class.
“In the Q3 that led into the 2019 general election, more Canadians than ever before chipped in to support Justin Trudeau and hardworking Liberal volunteers and campaigns across Canada,” said Azam Ishmael, National Director of the Liberal Party of Canada. “On October 21, Canadians sent the Liberal team back to Ottawa with a mandate to make life more affordable, to continue to fight climate change, and get guns off our streets. We’ve made real progress for Canadians over these past four years, and working together, there’s much more to do.”
The median donation to the Liberal Party in Q3 was just $20 at a time, and 93 percent of all donations were under $200. There are also now more active monthly grassroots donors to the Liberal Party of Canada than at any other time in the party’s history, building on the continued success of local EDAs out-fundraising their Conservative counterparts at a margin of nearly 2-to-1.
Filings with Elections Canada also continue to highlight that Liberal supporters are getting far more value for their donations than Conservatives. Annual returns since 2015 show that the Conservative Party spent $22,519,872 on fundraising expenses throughout 2016-2018, while the Liberal Party spent just $9,254,606.
Q3 filings from all parties will be available on Elections Canada’s website at Elections.ca
The Liberal Party of Canada’s successful re-election campaign also saw the party’s largest-ever volunteer mobilization and digital engagement programs. Tens of thousands of Liberal volunteers made more than 21 million knocks and calls before and during the campaign to start new conversations with Canadians about building a better future.

Toronto, ON – The following is a statement from the Hon. Mary Ng, Liberal M.P. for
Markham—Thornhill:
—
“Andrew Scheer should open up his $1500 behind-closed-doors fundraiser tonight at the exclusive private home of Conservative Senator Linda Frum in one of Toronto’s ritziest neighbourhoods.
“Andrew Scheer continues to refuse to grant media access to his behind-closed-doors fundraisers so nobody knows who is lobbying him or what promises he’s making in secret. Scheer won’t open the doors because he wants to talk about his plan to cut the taxes of his wealthy friends, while slashing services Canadians depend on.
“Less than a year ago, Conservative MP Kerry Diotte called these events ‘unethical fundraising practices’ and said “As a party, we do not rely on wealthy elites and pay-to-play events.”
(Source: https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/house/sitting-259/hansard)
“Now that Elections Canada mandates the disclosure of fundraising events for party leaders, it is clear that the Conservatives were not telling the truth.
“Hosting the fundraiser at the home of a Conservative Senator also shows again that Andrew Scheer plans to reinstate Stephen Harper’s Senate policy by stacking the Senate with partisan Conservatives.
“The Liberal Party has been the first and only party to move forward with the strongest standards in federal politics for open and transparent political fundraising events, including allowing media to attend events.
“Canadians expect our political leaders to meet the highest standards for openness and transparency. It’s time that Mr. Scheer did the right thing and stopped barring journalists from the Conservative Party’s behind-closed-doors fundraising events.”

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released three new TV ads to highlight that a re-elected Liberal government will continue to take decisive action to fight the climate crisis.
“In October, you get to choose. We can go back to the Harper years, when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change – or fight for a better future,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, in one of the new ads. “I’m for moving forward for everyone. It’s that clear – and it’s that important. The future of our planet is at stake.”
The ads launch comes at the start of Global Climate Action Week. In the coming days, we will announce further ambitious action to combat the climate crisis – the defining global issue of our time. The science is clear, the evidence is clear, and Canadians are clear – we must step up and protect our environment. Our kids and grandkids are counting on us.
Over the last four years, the Liberal government took significant action to protect our environment for generations to come, including:

putting a price on the pollution that causes climate change;
banning harmful single-use plastics;
protecting nearly 14 per cent of Canada’s coasts and marine areas;
building 1,200 public transit projects across the country;
making zero-emission vehicles more accessible and affordable;
investing in energy efficiency to help families and businesses save money;
committing to phase out coal power by 2030, and investing in renewables like wind and solar;
safeguarding our oceans and coasts with our historic Oceans Protection Plan; and
making the largest conservation investments in Canadian history.

“A better future doesn’t just happen. We make it happen,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Andrew Scheer doesn’t think it’s possible to grow the economy and fight climate change. He’s wrong. Our plan will create jobs, reduce pollution, and leave a healthier planet for our kids and grandkids.”

Ottawa, ON – The following is a statement by Liberal MPs: Hon. Dr. Hedy Fry, John Oliver, Kamal Khera, Sonia Sidhu, Rob Oliphant, Hon. Dr. Carolyn Bennett, and Dr. Doug Eyolfson.
________________________________________
“Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives have been caught holding a private, closed-door $250 strategy session on health care privatization. Yesterday, we wrote to Andrew Scheer, calling on him to cancel this inappropriate event.
“For $250, Conservatives are selling access to Lisa Raitt, Pierre Poilievre, and Marilyn Gladu for a one-night-only event to discuss the ‘business of healthcare.’
“They’re calling Pierre Poilievre the next Finance Minister and Marilyn Gladu ‘our next Health Minister.’ It’s completely inappropriate. If this isn’t selling access, we don’t know what is.
“It’s no accident when Conservatives talk about the healthcare and business in the same breath. Canadians know that they mean privatization.
“The Conservative example in Ontario is alarming. Doug Ford was recently accused of making plans to privatize healthcare and he has made indefensible cuts to funding for children with autism.
“Liberals are committed to public health care – like our Budget 2019 commitment to move forward on implementing national pharmacare to make prescription drugs more affordable and accessible to more Canadians. Meanwhile, Conservatives want to roll back the clock to an era when your quality of healthcare depended on how much you could pay.
“Liberals are proud of Canada’s healthcare system, one based on need and not ability to pay. We believe in patients over profits and that all you should need to get healthcare in Canada is your health card, not your credit card. It was a Liberal government that introduced the Canada Health Act and our Liberal government will continue to ensure that all Canadians have access to health services and to ensure our system remains fair for all Canadians.”

Waterloo, ON – A re-elected Liberal government will help up to 250,000 more public school kids get a spot in before and after-school programs and nearly double federal spending on child care.
Kids across Canada are heading back to school this month. But for many families with elementary school children, finding a spot in before and after school care programs will be difficult and expensive. In 2019, less than one in three elementary school kids will be able to get a space — and in Ontario, for families lucky enough to get a spot, it will cost them more than $4,000 this year. Meanwhile, parents who work late shifts or irregular hours have even fewer child care options. Since child care still falls disproportionately to women, moms are too often left to shoulder the responsibility.
“Parents shouldn’t have to worry about finding quality child care that won’t break the bank. But for too many families, getting their kids the care they need is challenging and expensive. That’s unacceptable,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “Today, we’re investing to create hundreds of thousands of new before and after school spaces and lower the costs of child care for families.”
A re-elected Liberal government will help parents with elementary school kids by doing the following:

We will create up to 250,000 more before and after school spaces for kids under the age of ten;
We will put $800 back into the pockets of the average Ontario family of four — every year — by lowering parents’ fees by ten percent across the country. More than one million families will benefit;
We will dedicate a portion of the new spaces to provide more child care options for parents who work overtime, late shifts, or multiple jobs so they can count on help when they need it most.

We will do this by nearly doubling the federal support we provide to the provinces and territories through the Early Learning and Child Care Framework, investing at least $535 million more each year.
These measures build on four years of Liberal investments in child care and families, including:

the Canada Child Benefit, which — in addition to investments in child care — is putting more money in the pockets of nine out of ten families to help with the high cost of raising kids. Since 2015, the CCB has helped lift more than 300,000 Canadian kids out of poverty;
the Early Learning and Child Care Framework, which invested $7.5 billion dollars to create tens of thousands of new child care spaces around the country; and
a commitment to develop an additional 40,000 high quality and affordable learning spaces each year, rising to 100,000 by 2030.

“Just like Stephen Harper, Andrew Scheer’s idea of helping families is to give tax cuts to those who attend private schools,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Canadian families need high quality, affordable child care solutions, not tax breaks for the wealthy at everyone else’s expense. Liberals have a real plan to make smart investments now, so that families can get the care they need for their kids, and help them get the best start possible in life.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on World Mental Health Day:
“Kids and parents. Friends and loved ones. Colleagues at work and folks in our communities. Mental health affects all of us – and that’s why we need to talk about it. Having an honest conversation, sharing our stories with compassion and openness – these are ways we can make it easier for people to reach out and get the help they need. Yet too often, fear of stigma makes people suffer in silence. World Mental Health Day is a chance to change that.
This year, World Mental Health Day focuses on suicide prevention. No family should have to go through losing a loved one to suicide. No one should have to feel hopeless because they can’t get the support they need. That’s why we’re going to set clear national standards for access to mental health services – to make sure every Canadian can get quality support quickly, when they need it most.
In Canada, too many Indigenous communities lose young people, elders, parents, and friends to suicide. Over the last four years, we’ve made important progress through initiatives like the Inuit-led National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy, but much more needs to be done. Last month, we announced that a re-elected Liberal government will work together with Indigenous peoples to create distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation, to make sure Indigenous communities have access to high quality, culturally-relevant health care and mental health services.
We’ve made mental health a priority because no one should ever have to suffer in silence. Yet too many Canadians go through these struggles without the help they need – and that’s especially true for veterans. That’s unacceptable, and that’s why we will make sure every veteran has access to high quality mental health care, when and where they need it. We will move forward with a new rapid-response service, and we will reach out to every Canadian veteran to make sure they know about the help available. We will also make it easier for veterans to get disability benefits, and give our veterans up to $3,000 in additional free counselling services before a disability claim is required.
In the past four years, our Liberal government has made major strides to advance mental health. We made Canada’s largest-ever investment in mental health, and working with the provinces and territories, we made mental health a key priority in our health accords for the first time in Canadian history.
But this is just the beginning, and we’re going to keep building on our work. A re-elected Liberal government will include mental health as a specific element of occupational health and safety in the Canada Labour Code. Understanding that addiction is closely tied to mental health, we will invest to help more people access the addiction treatment services they need. We will also strengthen support for LGBTQ2 communities, including by further investing in the mental health crisis hotline we launched earlier this year.
No matter who we are or what we do, there is no shame in struggling with a mental health issue. Mental health affects all of us, whether someone we love is suffering or we’ve gone through these struggles ourselves. Let’s work together to break down stigma, move forward, and build a healthier Canada for everyone.”

Ottawa, ON – The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Rosh Hashana:
“Tonight, at sunset, Jewish communities in Canada and around the world will celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.
Rosh Hashana marks the start of the High Holidays, culminating in Yom Kippur. It is a time to reflect on the past year, and turn towards the future with hope. As family and friends dip apples in honey and share special meals together, we remember what matters most – spending time with loved ones and working to build a better world.
Just like today is a chance to celebrate the many contributions of Jewish Canadians, it is also a time to recommit to fighting antisemitism, hatred, and discrimination in all their forms. For many Jewish Canadians, this year has been a difficult one. Communities in Canada and beyond have suffered violent acts of hate – acts that have no place in our country, or our world. We will always stand with the Jewish community, and stand united against hate – and together, we will make our world a better one.
Our diversity, compassion, and openness are Canada’s strengths. Today, I encourage all Canadians to reflect on how we can bring those values to life every day.
On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a joyful and peaceful New Year.
Shana Tova Umetuka!”

Ottawa, ON – Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada announced today that Jeremy Broadhurst will serve as Campaign Director for the 2019 federal election campaign.
“We’ve been making real progress together since 2015 to strengthen our middle class, grow our economy, and protect a clean environment for our kids and grandkids, and the 2019 campaign offers us the opportunity to work even harder for Canadians in the years ahead,” said Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. “Jeremy Broadhurst’s leadership was instrumental in our party’s modernization and our work together to earn a majority mandate from Canadians 2015. His proven record of success on both local and national campaigns, and in government, will help us continue to build a 2019 campaign that is innovative, empowering, and competitive in every part of Canada.”
Jeremy Broadhurst served as National Director of the Liberal Party of Canada from 2013 to 2015, and led a new party-wide commitment to innovative campaign technologies and grassroots field organizing – helping take the party from third place to a majority government in one election cycle. Jeremy comes to the campaign after having served as Chief of Staff to Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Chrystia Freeland, from 2017-19, and Deputy Chief of Staff and Deputy Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister from 2015-17. He has served as a senior advisor to every Liberal Leader since Interim Leader Bill Graham.
“Justin Trudeau and Liberals across Canada earned a mandate in 2015 on the strength of more than four million conversations with Canadians and the involvement of more than 80,000 dedicated volunteers, and we’ll need even more of that hope and hard work over the course of the next 173 days,” said Broadhurst. “I look forward to working closely with our Leader, our National Campaign Co-Chairs, and our campaign staff and volunteers across Canada to build a positive, innovative, and forward-looking campaign that will re-elect Justin Trudeau and even more Liberal candidates this October.”
Jeremy’s appointment as Campaign Director follows January’s announcement of the Hon. Navdeep Bains, Nikki Hipkin, Brittney Kerr, the Hon. Dominic LeBlanc, and Sylvie Paradis as Co-Chairs of the Party’s 2019 National Campaign Committee, and the September 2018 announcement of the Hon. Ralph Goodale and Mona Fortier’s roles as Co-Chairs of the National Platform Committee.
Liberal campaigns across Canada have started 2019 strong, with new by-election victories, growth in grassroots fundraising, more than 180 nominated candidates, and the momentum of more than 1.3 million new conversations with Canadians and 1,000 volunteer engagement events over the past year – the party’s largest-ever volunteer mobilization outside of an election.

Ottawa, ON – In response to Andrew Scheer’s fake climate plan, Catherine McKenna, Liberal M.P. for Ottawa Centre, released the following statement:
“It has been 416 days since Andrew Scheer promised a climate plan. There is a reason he waited until the last hours of this Parliament. He wanted nobody around to debate ideas that will cost Canadians more while doing less to protect our environment and the future for our kids.
“The Conservatives are ignoring the smartest companies and leading economists who tell us fighting climate change is a recipe for global stability and economic success. Extreme weather events are increasing in severity and costs are spiraling. All the while, Conservative politicians like Jason Kenney and Doug Ford make cuts to flood and wildfire management programs and do less to fight pollution.
“Canadians want an ambitious and sensible climate plan that keeps a healthy economy growing while tackling emissions at home and with partners around the world. Not a return to the failed policies of the past, written by fringe oil lobbyists who want to have unlimited pipelines and to gut environmental protections and shut down public input. Unfortunately, that is what the Conservatives want Canadians to accept.”

Toronto, ON — Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new set of ads reminding Canadians that when the Conservatives were last in office, they made life harder for seniors and older Canadians looking forward to retirement.
When Stephen Harper’s Conservatives raised the age of retirement, it took thousands of dollars away from seniors — forcing them to work longer, and preventing them from spending time with their families. Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are the same. He voted against lowering the age of retirement back to 65, and his party pledged to reverse the changes we made to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan.
“Whenever the Conservatives cut taxes, they cut them for the wealthy — and in this election, it’s no different,” says Leader of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, in one of the new ads. “I just don’t think that’s right. I’m for moving forward, for everyone.”
To help older Canadians save more money and retire with confidence, the Liberals have:

Lowered the retirement age back to 65;
Made the most significant enhancement to the Canada Pension Plan since its creation;
Increased Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement;
Lifted 50,000 seniors out of poverty;
Promised to lift another 20,000 seniors out of poverty by increasing Old Age Security again when seniors turn 75; and
Promised to give up to $2,080 in additional benefits, every year, to those who’ve lost a loved one by increasing survivor’s benefits.

Along with giving more support to seniors, a re-elected Liberal government will also lower taxes for the middle class and make life more affordable for those who need a break — not for the wealthiest one per cent.
“The Conservative approach gives tax breaks to millionaires,” continues Mr. Trudeau in one of the ads. “We believe in helping those who need it most: middle class Canadians and those working hard to join them.”

Ottawa, ON – The Liberal Party of Canada has started this election year with another quarter of strong grassroots fundraising results, with more than 33,290 Canadians (up from 28,960 in Q1 of 2018) contributing $3,857,163 to support Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team’s positive plan to strengthen the middle class and grow our economy.
A growing base of grassroots donors in Q1 of 2019 also builds on the success of the preceding two quarters, with the Liberal Party having recently achieved its best-ever Q3 and Q4 fundraising results outside of an election campaign.
“Liberal campaigns across Canada have started 2019 strong, with new by-election victories, growth in grassroots fundraising, and the momentum of more than 1.3 million new conversations with Canadians and 1,000 volunteer engagement events over the past year,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “While Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are focused on the same politics of secrecy and division that we all remember from Stephen Harper, Canadians are supporting Justin Trudeau’s positive progress to strengthen the middle class, grow the economy, and protect a clean environment for our families.”
The median donation to the Liberal Party in Q4 was just $10 at a time, and 96 percent of all donations were under $200 – an example of the party’s strong and growing success with grassroots fundraising. Q1 of 2019 also continued to see more active monthly grassroots donors to the Liberal Party of Canada than at any other time in the party’s history, and the month of March saw a 167% increase in online fundraising compared to the same month last year.
Recent filings with Elections Canada have also highlighted that Liberal supporters are getting far more value for their donations than Conservatives. The 2017 annual returns show that the Conservative Party spent $7,189,100 on fundraising expenses throughout the year while the Liberal Party spent just $2,702,363.
Throughout this mandate, local Liberal riding associations have also continued to outraise their Conservative counterparts by as much as 3-to-1.

MONTREAL, QC – “Andrew Scheer would put Canada’s economy and our place in the world at risk with his reckless and divisive foreign policy,” says Liberal MP and Quebec Campaign Co-Chair Pablo Rodriguez. “Whether it’s Andrew’s Scheer’s endorsement of Brexit chaos, skepticism on climate change, corrosive rhetoric on immigration, or uncertainty on NAFTA, the Conservative plan amounts to risk and uncertainty that would hurt Canadians and our economy.”
“On NAFTA, Andrew Scheer followed Stephen Harper’s lead urging Canada to capitulate to the Americans to get a deal at any cost. Now, Scheer criticizes the new NAFTA, threatening to plunge Canada back into crippling economic and trade uncertainty,” said Rodriguez. “And after years of Conservative delay and incompetence on trade, it was Liberals who finally ratified new European and Pacific trade deals.”
Andrew Scheer’s foreign policy recklessness, risk, and division:

Scheer’s NAFTA Uncertainty– Andrew Scheer criticizes the new NAFTA, threatening to plunge Canada’s economy into crippling trade uncertainty.
Scheer enthusiastically endorsed Brexit, inexplicably supporting economic chaos.
Scheer would effectively pull Canada out of the Paris Climate Accord when climate change is doing untold damage to Canada’s economy, even though he voted for it.
Scheer espouses the same corrosive rhetoric about immigration and refugees that is dividing many parts of the world today.
And Andrew Scheer wont even defend same-sex marriage or women’s rights here in Canada, let alone stand up for minority rights around the world.

“After ten years of failed Conservative foreign policy, Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government is restoring Canada’s place in the world, including restoring and investing in Canada’s military,” said Rodriguez. “Canadians don’t want to go back to Stephen Harper’s failed foreign policy, and that’s all Andrew Scheer is offering.”

Ottawa, ON – With less than one year until the 2019 federal election campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada’s supporters across the country are breaking new records for grassroots fundraising. The Liberal Party has achieved its best-ever third quarter for grassroots fundraising outside of an election year, with more than 33,000 Canadians contributing $3,761,601 to support Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team’s plan to strengthen the middle class.
“As we count down to the next election, Canada’s Liberal movement is stepping up with our strongest-ever third quarter for grassroots fundraising outside of a campaign,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “While Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are doubling down on the same negative and divisive politics that we saw from Stephen Harper, Canadians are showing support for Justin Trudeau’s positive progress to strengthen our middle class, grow our economy, and make life better for Canadian families.”
The median donation to the Liberal Party in Q3 was just $10 at a time, and 96 percent of all donations were under $200. There are also now more active monthly grassroots donors to the Liberal Party of Canada than at any other time in the party’s history.
Recent filings with Elections Canada have also highlighted that Liberal supporters are getting far more value for their donations than Conservatives. The 2017 annual returns filed posted this summer show that the Conservative Party spent $7,189,100 on fundraising expenses throughout last year while the Liberal Party spent just $2,702,363.
Q3 filings from all parties will be available on Elections Canada’s website at Elections.ca
This summer also saw Liberal teams across Canada launch the party’s largest-ever volunteer mobilization outside of an election, with Liberal volunteers organizing 579 “Summer of Action” engagement events across Canada in July and August alone – starting hundreds of thousands of new conversations with Canadians. More than 134,000 Canadians have registered as new Liberals in the last two years alone, and that grassroots support is continuing to grow every day.

Burnaby, BC — A re-elected Liberal government will cut taxes in half for companies that produce zero emissions technologies, which will create jobs, grow Canadian businesses, and help us get to net-zero.
In the coming years, the market for clean technology — which uses renewable energy and emits less pollution — is expected to exceed $2.5 trillion by 2022. Canada will lead the way: to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, and to achieve the ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
“It’s time to be a part of the solution,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We have the talent, we have the vision, and we have the reputation of being the best place in the world to start and grow a zero emissions tech business.”
A re-elected Liberal government will make Canada the most attractive place to start — and grow — a business that produces zero emissions technology. We will:

Cut in half corporate taxes for companies that develop technologies or manufacture products that have zero emissions;
The corporate taxes for small cleantech businesses will be cut from 9 per cent to 4.5 per cent, and the larger cleantech companies will see their taxes drop from 15 percent to 7.5 per cent.
Continue to lead by example and ensure all federal buildings run on clean electricity by 2022; and
Leverage the purchasing power of the federal government to further drive clean technology adoption, by strengthening existing green procurement policies.

This builds on a strong Liberal record of encouraging businesses to invest in sustainability and create hundreds and thousands of jobs, including:
Allowing businesses to immediately write-off the full cost of installing clean energy equipment; and
Investing in the first ever completely electric mine, as well as the first zero-emissions aluminum smelter.
“From electric cars to renewable power, we’ve made huge leaps in what’s possible when it comes to protecting our air, our water, and our future,” said Mr. Trudeau. “While Conservatives want to make polluting free again, we’re looking forward — on the next generation of clean technology, built right here by Canadians.”

Halifax, NS – The following statement was made by Sean Fraser, Member of Parliament for Central Nova:
—
Conservatives are arriving in Halifax today as a divided party focused on policies and politics that divide Canadians. Liberals are focused on our positive plan to create new jobs and strengthen our middle class.
Canadians don’t want a return to the Harper decade. But in over a year as leader of the Conservatives, all Andrew Scheer has really done is show Canadians that he wants to do exactly that.
Andrew Scheer has offered no plan to grow the middle class or help Canadian families, offered no plan to confront climate change, and he’s doubled down on Stephen Harper’s playbook of negative and divisive politics. It’s clear that it’s still Stephen Harper’s party.
Justin Trudeau’s positive plan for real change is making a real difference in the lives of families across Canada, with important steps like lower taxes for the middle class and the new Canada Child Benefit, which is providing more money for 9 out of 10 families.
Canadians have created over 600,000 new jobs since 2015, Canada’s unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years, and we have had the fastest-growing economy in the G7.
Real change is working, and we can’t let Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives take us back to the failed policies of Stephen Harper.

Note: MPs Sean Fraser (Central Nova) and Joel Lightbound (Louis-Hébert) are available for comment in Halifax.

Québec City, QC – As Andrew Scheer launches his campaign in Québec, Pablo Rodriguez and Diane Lebouthilier, Québec Campaign Co-Chairs, issued the following statement:
“Andrew Scheer is launching his campaign today in Trois-Rivières, but Québecers know that Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives, just like those of Stephen Harper, do not share their priorities.
Environment
“Québecers know that urgent action is needed to combat climate change. The Conservatives have delivered a bogus plan that would take Canada backward on its environmental responsibilities by eliminating the price on pollution and doing everything to please oil lobbyists.
Economy
“Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives will make deep cuts to services on which Québecers depend. For our part, we introduced the Canada Child Benefit, which gives more money to 9 out of 10 Canadian families; cut taxes for the middle class while raising taxes on the wealthiest 1% of Canadians; and lowered taxes for small businesses.
Free Trade
“On the NAFTA file, Andrew Scheer advocated for total surrender. His pandering would have meant a dismantling of supply management in the dairy industry, an end to the exemption that protects Québec culture, and the elimination of all possible recourse for the Québec softwood lumber industry against the Americans.
“On the topic of unfair and illegal tariffs on US imports of Canadian aluminum, the Conservatives demanded that we drop our retaliatory measures without any concessions from the Americans. We stood strong for our workers and negotiated an agreement to lift these tariffs.
Local Infrastructure
“We invested more than 70 million dollars to support a high-frequency rail project for the Québec City-Toronto corridor by way of Trois-Rivières. For his part, Andrew Scheer promised to eliminate the infrastructure bank that finances the study of this project.
Culture
“For 10 years, the Scheer and Harper Conservatives made cuts to our culture. They made cuts to Radio-Canada, our official languages, and critical funding for our artists and creators. Québecers remember the war the Conservatives waged against the cultural community.
“In 2015, we promised to repair the damage. Since that time, we have made the largest ever reinvestment in culture.
“On October 21, let’s choose forward. Justin Trudeau’s team will work hard for you and with you.”

The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Global Dignity Day:
“Today, young people, students, teachers, and volunteers around the world will come together to celebrate the dignity inherent in all of us.
Global Dignity Day reminds us that everyone has the right to live in dignity. It’s about building a world where compassion and kindness win out over division and injustice – a world where everyone has a real and fair shot at success.
Advocates are working every day to build that world – and young people are leading that charge. Around the planet, they’re deepening our connections and creating a stronger global community – encouraging everyone to look beyond what divides us and celebrate the humanity we all share.
We have a lot to learn from our youngest leaders, who challenge us every day to do better and be better. Each day, we have the chance to make a difference, and put into practice values like kindness, generosity, openness, and respect. Even the smallest of actions can touch hearts and change lives.
As one of Global Dignity’s National Role Models, I encourage everyone to honour the inherent worth of others – today and every day. Let’s celebrate everything that unites us and lift each other up. Let’s look forward with hope – and move forward together.”

Burnaby, BC – The Liberal Party of Canada has announced that accomplished community leader and longtime MLA Richard T. Lee will be the Team Trudeau candidate for Burnaby South in the upcoming federal by-election.
“Richard Lee has a proven commitment to public service, and he has dedicated his career to making life better for Burnaby families,” said Suzanne Cowan, President of the Liberal Party of Canada. “We are honoured to welcome Richard to Team Trudeau as our Liberal candidate in this important by-election, and after sixteen years of service in the BC Legislature, I know he will be a strong and trusted voice for Burnaby South in Parliament.”
Richard represented Burnaby as a Member of the BC Legislative Assembly for sixteen years, where he also served as a Parliamentary Secretary and became the first Chinese-Canadian to serve as Deputy Speaker of the Legislature. He and his wife Anne have lived in Burnaby for 32 years and have raised their three children in the community, and he will work closely with Justin Trudeau to strengthen our middle class and grow the local economy.
“I’m proud to call Burnaby my home, and this by-election is about ensuring Burnaby South has a strong voice in Parliament to help make life better for families in this community,” said Richard T. Lee. “I’m looking forward to working with Justin Trudeau to keep making progress on Burnaby’s priorities, like investing in new affordable housing and better transit, creating good middle class jobs, and protecting a healthy environment for our kids and grandkids.”

Ottawa, ON – Today, the Liberal Party of Canada released a new radio ad to highlight the Liberals’ unmatched record when it comes to fighting for workers and protecting Canadian jobs.
“In the NAFTA negotiations, our Liberal government fought tooth and nail to protect Canadian jobs,” said Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “We said we would get a good deal, and that’s exactly what we achieved.”
The new NAFTA deal preserves more than $2 billion a day in cross-border trade between Canada and the United States. During negotiations, Andrew Scheer urged Canada to fold to America’s demands — no matter the cost to our economy or middle class workers.
“We stood up to Donald Trump on trade when the Conservatives wanted Canada to back down,” said Chrystia Freeland, Liberal candidate in the Toronto riding of University—Rosedale, in the new ad. “The Conservatives told us to take any deal we could get. Capitulation is not a negotiating strategy.”
The Liberal government stood up for Canadian workers and businesses by:

negotiating strong, enforceable labour and environment chapters in the new NAFTA that will protect our workers and our environment;
securing market access for Canadian car and car parts manufacturers, which protects our auto industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports; and
successfully removing unfair section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, which put more than 33,500 Canadian jobs at risk.

“We believe in the strength of Canadian workers, and in our country’s resolve to unite against anyone who would put middle class jobs — and the communities who rely on those jobs — at risk,” added Mr. Trudeau.

VANCOUVER, BC – Following the news that Andrew Scheer has adopted Doug Ford’s plan to make drastic and reckless cuts, Liberal M.P. Jonathan Wilkinson highlighted the risk that Andrew Scheer’s slash and burn policies would pose to the economy and our middle class.
“Andrew Scheer is committed to austerity and cuts. Today he has torn up his proposal for two years of cuts and he’s now promising five years of cuts. Just like Doug Ford is doing,” says Liberal M.P. Jonathan Wilkinson. “Canadians have seen what Conservative politicians do. They make devastating cuts. Ford is slashing health, education, environmental programs, and even libraries. Andrew Scheer is just another Conservative politician.”
Andrew Scheer will make drastic cuts to pay for his promises like a $1.7 billion tax break for wealthy Canadians. He said last week that every dollar in new spending would have to be matched by a dollar in cuts. So what will Andrew Scheer cut to pay for his tax break for wealthy Canadians? The truth is that Andrew Scheer does not have an economic plan – he has a scheme to make cuts, and he won’t tell you what’s on the chopping block. Scheer would have to make reckless cuts to programs and services that help middle class Canadians get ahead like:

The Housing Affordability Plan
Canada’s plan to take action on climate change
The plan to move forward on Pharmacare
Stronger pensions for seniors
Lower interest rates on student loans

Today, Canada’s economy is strong and growing, with record-low unemployment and poverty levels and more than one million new jobs created since late 2015. Canada’s record of economic success and our outstanding reputation as a place to invest and do business would be at risk under Andrew Scheer’s cuts plan.
“Andrew Scheer doesn’t have an economic plan. He has a cuts plan, and he’s making it up on the fly,” said Jonathan Wilkinson. “Andrew Scheer can’t keep his promises without making reckless cuts that would threaten all of the gains that Canadians have made over the last four years. Liberals have plan that is working. One that invests in Canadians and the success of the middle class.”

St. John’s, NL – A re-elected Liberal government will put more money in parents’ pockets to help them in the first year of their children’s lives.
Nothing is more important to parents than spending time with their kids. But raising a family isn’t cheap, and the bills pile up early on – when parents are being paid less but baby products and child care cost more.
“Every parent knows that raising kids is expensive – especially in that first year,” said the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. “With everything else on their plates, the last thing new parents need to worry about is making ends meet. That’s why we’ll be there for families – so they can be there for their kids.”
A re-elected Liberal government will:

give up to $1,000 more to families to help when the costs of raising kids are highest, by boosting the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) by 15 per cent for children under the age of one;
make sure families get more money right away, by making maternity and parental benefits tax-free; and
make paid leave fairer for families, by introducing a 15-week leave for adoptive parents – so they get as much in benefits to care for their kids as everyone else.

These important steps will build toward a long-term vision that helps families when it matters most.
That’s why we will, within the first year of our mandate, work to establish Guaranteed Paid Family leave – an ambitious program that will make sure that parents who don’t qualify for paid leave through Employment Insurance or don’t get enough, because they’re between jobs, earn little, or haven’t worked enough hours, will receive a guaranteed income during the first year of their child’s life. This means every single Canadian parent will be able to afford to spend the first year at home with their kid.
Since 2015, our government has made it a priority to make life easier and more affordable for families:

We gave more money to nine out of ten families and helped lift 300,000 children from poverty, by creating the CCB;
We created tens of thousands of new child care spaces across the country, by developing the Early Learning and Child Care framework;
We made parental leave more flexible, by allowing parents to spread their time over 18 months; and
We gave both parents the option to take more time off with their newborn, by adding the five-week parental sharing benefit.

“Conservatives like Andrew Scheer and Doug Ford pretend they are for the people, but on the first opportunity, they cut taxes for the wealthiest and cut the help Canadian families rely on,” said Mr. Trudeau. “Our kids deserve the best possible start in life – and that’s exactly what today is all about.”

2019 English-language Leaders’ Debate
Last night, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau presented to Canadians his plan to continue investing in our middle class, grow the economy, and protect the environment. And the responses keep pouring in.
Quotations are included in their original language
“The most-passionate version of Trudeau emerged in the night’s final segment, on the environment and energy. There, again, Trudeau invoked the choice he wants voters to see, between Conservatives who would rip up the current plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and Liberals who are pledged to keep going.” – Aaron Wherry, CBC News, October 8, 2019
“Trudeau remained calm through the fast-paced debate, reciting his governing party’s record of investing in programs aimed at fostering prosperity.” – Alan Cochrane, Telegraph Journal, October 8, 2019
“Mr. Trudeau proved willing to fight back and make his Conservative political rival his rhetorical punching bag, forcing him to defend his stance on social issues such as abortion rights.” – Jessica Murphy, BBC News, October 8, 2019
« M. Trudeau a néanmoins réussi à se démarquer de son adversaire conservateur sur les questions sociales. M. Scheer a d’ailleurs prononcé les mots qu’il refusait de dire jeudi dernier, quand il a avancé que « comme des millions de Canadiens » il est « pro-vie ». Si l’objectif du chef libéral était de sortir du débat sans trop de blessures, il peut dire mission accomplie. » – Fanny Olivier, Radio-Canada, 7 octobre, 2019
“[Trudeau] emerged, it appears, unscathed, which for an incumbent is best you could hope for.” – Vassy Kapelos, CBC, October 7, 2019
“But ultimately I have to say probably the biggest winner out of this was the Prime Minister” – Jenni Byrne, CP24, October 7, 2019
“Overall Trudeau was strong; I don’t think anybody knocked him out of the ring.” – Tom Mulcair, News Talk 1010, October 8, 2019
“The loser tonight, sadly, was Mr. Scheer. And I say that because there were great expectations that he would effectively challenge Trudeau and he didn’t effectively challenge him.” – Robin Sears, CP24, October 7, 2019
“And Justin Trudeau for the most part, no gaffes, no mistakes. As steady as she goes for the most part for him tonight.” – Aleem Kanji (VP Government Relations – Sutherland Corporation), CTV News, October 7, 2019
« À plusieurs égards, le chef libéral Justin Trudeau a mieux défendu son bilan des quatre dernières années (…) il a aussi abondamment parlé des principales promesses contenues dans son programme électoral, ce qu’il avait omis de faire la semaine dernière. Il a finalement donné un certain sens à ce que pourrait être un second mandat libéral. » – Joël-Denis Bellavance, La Presse, 8 octobre 2019
“The loser in all this was Andrew Scheer. The Conservative leader needed to have a big night, after a week in which his reputation was pounded by his opponents for the alleged lack of transparency on his resumé, his views on issues of conscience and his nationality (…) If the Tories lose this election, putting a price on carbon is an issue they will have to revisit or risk being left looking like a BlackBerry in an iPhone world.” – John Ivison, National Post, October 8, 2019

On the Friday before the Thanksgiving long weekend, after all the Leaders’ debates have passed, and after thousands of Canadians have already cast their ballot, Andrew Scheer finally released his platform, which includes $53 billion in cuts, including $14 billion in hidden cuts.
Canadians have nothing to thank Andrew Scheer for this Thanksgiving. Here’s what people are saying about Andrew Scheer’s reckless plan:
Quotations are included in their original language
“Well this is incompetent. Infrastructure spending desperately needs to go up, not down.” – Emmett Macfarlane (University of Waterloo), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“What party releases its platform the Friday of a long weekend? One that doesn’t want too much attention focused on it would be my guess.” – Gary Mason (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Over and over again, Conservatives have demonstrated hostility towards Canada’s workers. Today, Andrew Scheer is doubling down on that hostility and seeking a mandate to cut. With a platform loaded with job-killing service cuts, it’s clear that Andrew Scheer represents an equal threat to Canadians as Stephen Harper.” – Hassan Yussuff (President of the Canadian Labour Congress), October 12, 2019
« Un gouvernement conservateur imposerait des compressions budgétaires de plusieurs dizaines de milliards de dollars dans son premier mandat. » – Philippe-Vincent Foisy et Hugo Prévost (Radio-Canada), 11 octobre, 2019
“Cities and communities across the country have an urgent need for increased investment in infrastructure. Proposed measures in this platform appear to move in the opposite direction, with fewer infrastructure dollars available year-over-year to create jobs, improve roads and bridges, and maintain the local services Canadians rely on.” – Bill Karsten (President of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities), October 11, 2019
« Assurément, pour que Montréal puisse poursuivre son élan, les partis doivent accroître leurs investissements en matière d’infrastructures et de transports en commun, notamment pour la ligne rose » – Cabinet de la Ville de Montréal (Le Devoir), 12 octobre 2019
“If what you seek is a coherent vision of conservatism in the 21st century, you will have to look elsewhere.” – Andrew Coyne (National Post), October 11, 2019
“The largest cuts are in unspecified “other operating expenses” – $14.4 billion over five years. The Conservatives suggest they can achieve that through reining in travel spending, consulting fees, and cutting down on federal office space.” – Alex Boutilier (Toronto Star), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The second largest proposed spending cut in the platform is a plan to save $14-billion over five years on federal government operating expenses, which are not detailed in the platform.” – Marieke Walsh (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
« Ces coupes seraient plus importantes que celles du gouvernement Harper dans les années 2010 et représentent des « risques significatifs », selon l’Institut des finances publiques et de la démocratie. » – Vincent Brousseau-Pouliot (La Presse), 12 octobre 2019
“The party said shrinking the size of cubicle space for public servants could be one of the ways to save that money.” – Marieke Walsh (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The single biggest saving measure is putting off some infrastructure spending. That will save $18-billion over five years.” – David Akin (Global), Twitter, October 11, 2019
« On savait déjà que M. Scheer voulait sabrer les subventions aux entreprises et l’aide étrangère, afin de récupérer au total 3 milliards de dollars par année. On sait maintenant où il ira chercher les dizaines de milliards additionnels qui lui manquaient pour remiser l’encre rouge. Ainsi, M. Scheer propose d’amputer 18 milliards de dollars au cours des cinq prochaines années des budgets d’infrastructures. » – Hélène Buzzetti et Marie Vastel (Le Devoir), 12 octobre 2019
“Now we see why this was released late on a Friday before a long weekend. Some big cuts with few specifics.” – Don Martin (CTV News), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The Conservative plan to balance the budget includes some serious cuts, including: – Cutting $1.5 billion a year by reviewing business subsidy programs -“Prioritizing” infrastructure spending, which would eliminate $1.3 billion in 2020-21 – Cutting foreign aid by $1.5 billion” – Rachel Gilmore (CTV News), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The Conservative platform has no mention of pharmacare or a new general national prescription drug plan. Earlier this year, the Conservative health critic suggested to media they would have a plan that would fill in the gaps for people w/o insurance. It’s not there” – Cormac Mac Sweeney (CityNews), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Vote for me and I’ll shrink your cubicle!” – Stephen Maher (Maclean’s), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Canadian govt controls 38,341 buildings. If Conservatives seriously want to pare back this number, they’ll start with, um, military. Smaller barracks? Munitions bunk beds?” – Jason Markusoff (Maclean’s), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“I’ve avoided the Doug Ford – Andrew Scheer comparisons because they’re definitely different people but the details coming out about the CPC fiscal plans, particularly on the cutting side, are eerily Ford-esque.” – Emmett Macfarlane (University of Waterloo), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“No #pharmacare plan; no plan to take on Big Pharma and reduce prescription drug costs. So much for @CPC_HQ and @AndrewScheer ‘putting everyday Canadians first’.” – Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, Twitter, October 11, 2019
“I think the prospect of the Conservatives saving $22 billion from “operating reductions” or $11 billion from cracking down on tax cheats is as likely to succeed as Scheer ordering the Salish Sea to reverse itself.” – John Ivison (National Post), October 12, 2019
« Le retour à l’équilibre budgétaire ne se fera pas sans compressions. Andrew Scheer prévoit couper dans les investissements en infrastructures à hauteur de 18 G$ sur cinq ans. À cela s’ajoutent 14 G$ en réduction des dépenses de fonctionnement… » – Guillaume St-Pierre (Journal de Montréal), 12 octobre 2019
“Tory costing of a carbon tax repeal. Apparently over five years, the net cost to the Government of giving up THIS MASSIVE TAX HIKE TAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF CANADIANS’ POCKETS is actually only about $180M. Imagine that.” – Alex Usher (Higher Education Strategy Associates), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“The Conservative party says it will cut $18-billion in infrastructure spending days after Mr. Scheer criticized the Liberals for not spending enough on infrastructure.” – Denise Balkissoon (Globe & Mail), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“There’s about $53 million in cuts, so changes that [the Conservatives] say are savings but are essentially cuts to different programs.” – Annie Bergeron Oliver (CTV Power Play), October 11, 2019
“Friday afternoon release, just ahead of a long weekend, that usually means bad news and the conservative blueprint for governing which came out less than an hour ago shows some startling ways to cut spending that had not been disclosed before.” – Don Martin (CTV Power Play), October 11, 2019
“This is Harper’s cuts on steroids. It’s going to hurt Canadians and the public services they rely on. Once again, Conservatives are trying to eliminate the evidence that’s required to create sound policy for all of Canada.” – Debi Daviau (President of Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada), Twitter, October 11, 2019
« Les troupes de M. Scheer comptent prioriser les dépenses faites par le fédéral en infrastructure, apprend-on dans le cadre financier des conservateurs. Ces derniers entendent ainsi aller chercher 1,3 milliard $ dès 2020-2021. Au terme de cinq ans, les conservateurs pensent ainsi pouvoir mettre de côté un total de 18 milliards $. Ce montant élevé a surpris l’experte en finances publiques Geneviève Tellier, de l’Université d’Ottawa. «C’est quand même majeur. Il va y avoir des projets qui n’auront pas lieu», croit-elle. » – Émilie Bergeron (TVA Nouvelles), 11 octobre 2019
“I think there are a lot of people and economists questioning whether this budget is putting too much emphasis on trying to find savings of balancing the budget instead of putting money into the economy.” – Annie Bergeron Oliver (CTV Power Play), October 11, 2019
“[The Conservatives] are going to have to lay off public services to get those sorts of savings.” – Kevin Page (Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy), CBC Power & Politics, Twitter, October 11, 2019
“@CPC_HQ costed platform has no funding for a national dementia strategy. We’ve asked @AndrewScheer how his party, if elected, will meet the government’s statutory obligation to implement a national strategy, without funding? “ – Dementia Justice, Twitter, October 11, 2019
“Andrew Scheer is promising to slash infrastructure spending… The Conservatives employed a series of fictions to pretend the infrastructure cuts – the single largest budget-balancing measure in the Conservative platform – aren’t really cuts.” – Campbell Clark (Globe and Mail), October 11, 2019
“I’ve read the Conservative Party platform and am disappointed to not see any direct mention of First Nations people. Increased investments are critical to First Nations’ success, which is why the Conservatives need to publicly explain how they will support our priorities. First Nations priorities are Canada’s priorities, and if focused on and implemented they will result in a better Canada for everyone.” – Perry Bellegarde, National Chief, Assembly of First Nations, Twitter, October 11, 2019
« Les conservateurs repoussent les projets d’infrastructure pour atteindre l’équilibre » – La Presse Canadienne, 11 octobre 2019
“The Conservatives intend to make major spending cuts, if elected.” – John Ivison (National Post), October 12, 2019
“Conservative leader Andrew Scheer revealing election platform in Delta— the key is how he plans to bring the budget back to balance in five years. That involves $53-billion in cuts.” – Martin MacMahon (NEWS 1130), Twitter, October 11, 2019
“On the Manitoba side, the federal Tory platform doesn’t mention Manitoba Hydro at all in talk of the electricity corridor (hydro and pipeline right-of-way). Quebec gets even more sway in immigration but nothing about boosting the provincial-nominee quota despite MB seeking more.” – Dylan Robertson (Winnipeg Free Press), Twitter, October 11, 2019

Reality Check: Liberals Spent Years Profiting off Student Debt Justin Trudeau’s government profited making billions of dollars off student debt, while young people struggled to get out from under crushing debt loads. “Justin Trudeau spent four years raking in billions of dollars in interest from young people who were just starting out in life, even while they were making sacrifices to make student loans payments every month — living at home, working two jobs, even putting off starting a family,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Trudeau and the Liberals let young people down. He gave a lot of fancy speeches about the next generation of Canadians — but never stopped reaching into their bank accounts and taking money away from them. Making a profit off student loans is wrong.” “Trudeau and the Liberals let young people down. He gave a lot of fancy speeches about the next generation of Canadians — but never stopped reaching into their bank accounts and taking money away from them. Making a profit off student loans is wrong.” The Liberals’ record on student debt shows how badly they’ve let down young Canadians: Total federal student debt is close to $17 billion dollars, while the Trudeau government has collected nearly $3 billion in interest payments from students since 2015.[1]
An internal government report called the student loan system “broken,” noting that the cost of education is growing faster than wages and higher costs of living are compounding the squeeze on young people.[2]
The average student debt burden is $26,000, takes between nine and 15 years to pay off, and payments can take up to 13% of graduates’ wages.[3]
The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that nearly half of students will have financial needs at or above student loan limits while in school by 2021.[4]
Four provinces have already eliminated their interest on their loans: British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. [5] ",2019-09-05

It’s Time for a New Deal for Northern Ontario Decades of Liberal and Conservative neglect of the North have hurt people. The NDP has a plan to make life more affordable for Northerners. SUDBURY – Today, NDP candidates Charlie Angus (Timmins-James Bay), Carol Hughes (Algoma–Manitoulin–Kapuskasing), Beth Mairs (Sudbury), Stef Paquette (Nickel Belt) and Rob Boulet (Nipissing-Timiskaming) announced a New Deal for Northern Ontario. For far too long, Northerners have been finding it harder to make ends meet. The Liberal and Conservative policies failed to address the significant challenges people face in the region, and the NDP knows it is time to do things differently. “Northern families are struggling to make ends meet while the Liberals are looking out for their corporate friends,” said Hughes. “In a country as rich as Canada, we need to do better, and we can do better. Liberals and Conservatives haven’t worked for us. Only Northern Ontario New Democrats have a plan to make life more affordable, advance reconciliation, and create jobs for the region.” Trudeau’s Liberals haven’t worked for Northern Ontario – they’ve made life more expensive and haven’t done enough on climate and to deliver better services for Indigenous communities. Andrew Scheer is just more of the same of what the North has gotten from Stephen Harper and Doug Ford – cuts to the services people need. “Both the Liberals and Conservatives have undermined the economic development of Northern Ontario by refusing to invest in FedNor and failing our people,” said Angus. “We will not sit idly by while our economy slows down because of their bad decisions. The NDP will give the North its due by finally making FedNor a stand-alone regional economic development agency. That's how we will pursue job growth, long-term development, and support the growth of co-operative, Indigenous, and community enterprises.” Creating jobs in the North, protecting our environment, and setting the terms of a true nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous people are all part of the NDP’s New Deal for Northern Ontario.

Liberals Should be Evicted for Phony Housing Promises Justin Trudeau likes to talk about housing. But the Parliamentary Budget Officer recently revealed that Justin Trudeau’s housing plan spends less as a percentage of GDP than the ten previous years under Stephen Harper, prompting Liberal housing lead Adam Vaughn to attack the independent PBO. Earlier this year, Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan got caught when they “double counted to rhetorical advantage” on the number of housing units they built. The Liberals didn’t mention “rent” once in their 2015 platform, and haven’t done anything to help renters during their four years in government. Nearly one in five Canadians spends more than 50% of their income on rent and utilities. The PBO also found that Trudeau’s government sent an additional $100 million to Ontario for housing programs, but allowed Doug Ford to cut funding for housing programs by $161 million, scrap rent control and slash funding to fight homelessness. On housing, Canadians can’t trust Justin Trudeau’s phony promises. ",2019-09-26

Trudeau Abandons Pharmacare 6 Days After Promising It It’s been 22 years since the Liberals first rolled out their pharmacare promise. This week, they dusted it off again in an announcement that experts say comes “nowhere near” what is needed for a national pharmacare program. In fact, Trudeau’s platform can only muster one vague paragraph on the topic:
 The platform contains no details and no funding to back up Trudeau’s pretty words. Just six days after telling Canadians he would bring in pharmacare, Justin Trudeau has completely abandoned Canadians struggling with the cost of prescription drugs. ",2019-09-29

Justin Trudeau Refuses to Denounce Bernier’s Debate Participation Despite Neo-Nazi, Hate Group Ties This morning it was revealed that among the founding members of Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada are members of extreme far-right, anti-immigrant hate groups. These include a former member of neo-Nazi group the Soldiers of Odin and a prominent member of Islamophobic hate group Pegida Canada. Despite these disturbing developments, Justin Trudeau is refusing to call on the Independent Debate Commission to reconsider their decision to allow Maxime Bernier to participate in upcoming leaders’ debates. This morning a reporter asked: “This morning Global News published a story showing some of the founding signatories to the People’s Party of Canada have either current or past ties to neo-nazi groups, Soldiers of Odin, far right groups. In light of this, would you ask the debate commissioner to reconsider the decision to allow Mr. Bernier in the debate?” Trudeau refused to denounce Bernier’s participation, instead blaming Stephen Harper for being selective about which debates he attended back in 2015. Jagmeet Singh has written to the debate commission to advocate against Bernier’s participation. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “It’s disappointing that Justin Trudeau has refused to denounce Maxime Bernier’s participation in the debates, even after we learned that founding members of his party are members of known hate groups. Canadians expect Justin Trudeau to do everything possible to fight racism. He should be saying clearly that we should not be giving a national platform to hateful beliefs.” ",2019-09-23

NDP Lays Out Fiscal Plan For Pharmacare, Dental Care, More Affordability for Families OTTAWA – With the NDP’s New Deal for People, families will get the medicine and dental care they need, lower cell phone bills, homes they can afford, an end to interest on student loans, and concrete advances on the climate crisis. And to pay for it, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and the NDP will stop letting the super-wealthy get away with not paying their fair share of taxes. “The system is rigged. And the NDP is going to un-rig it to work better for everyday people,” said Singh. “With Justin Trudeau in charge, the economy works great for the big pharma companies who are making record profits, but it’s not working for families paying sky-high prices for prescription drugs. It works great for the rich and the powerful who got a $14 billion tax break, but not for people struggling to find an affordable place to live. And it works great for the big polluters, but not for the young people who are worried about what kind of earth they’re being left to live on. I’m going to fix that. My plan is all about changing who Ottawa works for, and I choose you.” On Thursday, Singh revealed the NDP’s six priorities the NDP will ensure the next government delivers. A national universal pharmacare plan and a national dental care plan, delivering affordability and better health to Canadians.
A home people can afford, including massive investments in housing, real action on money laundering and a tax on foreign speculators.
Beginning to tackle student debt, by taking all interest off of student loans, current and future.
Lower cell phone and internet bills, by capping prices.
A bold plan and concrete action to fight the climate crisis, ending the subsidies to big oil companies, committing to science-based targets and helping workers during the transition from fossil fuels.
Ensuring the super-wealthy are paying their fair share by introducing a super wealth tax, closing tax loopholes, and ending giveaways for the richest companies and individuals. Singh’s platform includes a Super-Wealth Tax on fortunes over $20 million; an end to offshore tax havens, legally used by the wealthy to avoid paying Canadian taxes; ending all fossil fuel subsidies; and ending tax loopholes. These measures raise progressive new revenues and ensure a declining debt-to-GDP over the four-year plan. Quick Facts Everything in the NDP plan is additional to existing spending and programs.
The NDP plan does not raise taxes on middle or lower-income Canadians.
The Parliamentary Budget Officer has costed all the NDP’s revenue measures.
Debt-to-GDP ratio falls every year under the NDP’s four-year plan.
The NDP plan includes a Contingency Fund, equal to 15% of revenues every year. This is to make up for any shortfalls in revenue. ",2019-10-11

NDP Commits to Undoing Liberal Disappointments for Indigenous Peoples Jagmeet Singh and Chief Rudy Turtle campaign in Grassy Narrows GRASSY NARROWS — NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and the NDP candidate for Kenora, Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle, were in Grassy Narrows Saturday to talk about the New Democrats’ commitment to reconciliation and undoing the wake of disappointment Justin Trudeau and the Liberals have left in First Nations communities. In 2015, Trudeau promised a new relationship with Indigenous peoples, but four years later Indigenous people have been let down and even mocked by the Liberal Leader. “Mr. Trudeau said all the right things about reconciliation — but reconciliation is about action to make people’s lives better, not just pretty words,” said Singh. “The way Mr. Trudeau has treated Indigenous people hasn’t matched up with his words or promises.” On Friday, the federal government announced it is taking First Nations children to court, appealing a ruling that said the government ""willfully and recklessly'' discriminated against them — prompting Singh to say there’s no excuse that justifies the Trudeau Liberals taking First Nations children to court and demanding Trudeau drop the appeal. And in Grassy Narrows, 50 years ago, toxic chemicals were dumped into the English River system in a corporate crime that left generations of families suffering from mercury poisoning. Trudeau has failed to sign an agreement to help the community care for those suffering the effects of the poison. Meanwhile, when a Grassy Narrows community member confronted the Liberal leader at a party fundraiser, Trudeau mockingly shot back: “Thank you for your donation.” “For First Nations people who were hopeful, the trust has been broken. We’ve been let down,” said Turtle. “The people of Grassy Narrows deserve the kind of care and treatment we would all want for our families. And from coast-to-coast-to-coast, First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities have been left waiting for clean water, decent housing and safe schools where the next generation can get a good start. Indigenous children can’t wait another four years.” Singh and New Democrats have committed to building a treatment centre for Grassy Narrows residents affected by long-term mercury exposure, working with the Nation’s leadership and the community. Singh’s New Deal for People also commits to lifting all drinking water advisories for good by 2021 in First Nations communities, and implementing Shannen’s Dream, which spells out equitable access to education, backed by federal investments and infrastructure, so no students are forced into schools that aren’t safe.

The Liberals, like the Conservatives before them, are gradually destroying our supply management system and the vitality of our agriculture system. Supply management has been the lifeblood of our regions, and it contributes to our food sovereignty. We should be proud of the system we implemented, and we must protect it, not use it as a bargaining chip during trade negotiations. New Democrats are not afraid to stand up to our trade partners to protect dairy farmers and the supply management system. We did it for CETA, for diafiltered milk, for CPTPP, for CUSMA and you can continue to count on us to stand up and speak out against any further concessions to the dairy sector. As government, we commit to never opening more breaches during future free trade negotiations. After promising to fully compensate the dairy industry, the Liberals announced a package that doesn’t make a clear long-term commitment over the first year in terms of direct paid compensations to producers and does not fully cover the losses incurred by CETA and CPTPP. And this, a couple of weeks before an election. The Liberals forgot about small processors and did not take any concrete commitment for compensation due to losses from CUSMA. The NDP is committed to fully compensating producers for losses due to all trade deals including CUSMA. We will also hold reciprocal standards with our business partners and give our farmers and producers equal footing when competing with foreign products in the Canadian marketplace.

One Year Later: Sears Retirees Getting Ripped Off While Trudeau Sides with Corporation New Democrats want a new deal for Sears Canada retirees OTTAWA – On the first year anniversary of when retirees officially had their pensions slashed by 30 percent following the bankruptcy and closure of Sears Canada, the NDP is still fighting for a new deal for these workers. When the company shut down its doors in 2018, 18,000 retirees discovered the pension plans built with their money would not pay out as planned. The NDP’s New Deal for People will ensure that pensioners are at the front of the line when a company goes bankrupt – making sure unfunded pension liabilities owed to workers, and employees’ severance pay, are the top priority. “If it wasn’t for the Liberals letting big corporations off the hook for pension theft, Sears Canada workers would not have to carry the weight of legal fees to fight for what is rightfully theirs,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Liberals and Conservatives turned their back on workers to make life easier for a big company and their executives.” The NDP's plan will stop companies from paying out bosses when people’s pensions are underfunded, and will create a mandatory, industry-financed pension insurance program. NDP Critic for Pensions, Scott Duvall (Hamilton Mountain), introduced a bill in the House of Commons that aimed to change bankruptcy and insolvency law to stop pension theft by big corporations. “Trudeau’s Liberals and Scheer’s Conservatives have done nothing to help workers whose pensions have been taken away from them because of corporate greed,” said Duvall. “Instead of strengthening support for Canadian workers and retirees, they have sided with rich corporations to undermine retirement benefits. This is wrong. New Democrats believe that every Canadian should be able to count on a dignified, secure retirement – and we’ll fight hard to protect pensions that workers have earned.” ",2019-08-08

NDP Demands Elections Canada Ensure First Nations Evacuees' Right to Vote THE PAS - NDP candidate and incumbent Niki Ashton (Churchill--Keewatinook Aski) today called on Elections Canada to ensure that First Nation evacuees have the right to vote. First Nations in the Interlake region were evacuated from their homes last Sunday following a devastating snowstorm. “Elections Canada needs to be taking this seriously,” said Ashton. “It’s inconceivable that, due to the actions of Elections Canada main office, entire communities are going to be essentially disenfranchised from voting.” The NDP sent a letter to the Chief Electoral Officer calling on him to rectify this situation. Among the issues raised included the fact that these communities were unable to vote during the advance vote and the actual voting location in Winnipeg is largely inaccessible to many evacuees spread out throughout the city and outside of the city. In order to ensure the voting rights of First Nations affected, the NDP is asking Elections Canada to make available both mobile polls and the usage of special ballots so that evacuees registered with the Red Cross can have their voices heard.

$700 for Every Canadian: Why Won’t Justin Trudeau Close Tax Havens? In June, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) found that Canada is losing up to $25 billion in revenue every year from offshore tax havens. That’s nearly $700 for every Canadian. The PBO report also indicates that provisions in the Income Tax Act prevent the Canada Revenue Agency from disclosing relevant tax data for individual companies, making it impossible for the PBO or the public to assess whether individual companies are avoiding Canadian taxes. Currently, corporations have no obligation to prove that transactions to transfer funds between Canada and other jurisdictions have an economic purpose aside from reducing the amount of taxes owed in Canada. The NDP attempted to fix this by introducing legislation that would require companies to demonstrate that such transactions have an economic substance. Justin Trudeau and the Liberals have refused to address this problem. While these companies avoid billions in taxes, Canadians are struggling with rising costs like prescription drugs and housing. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau has chosen the rich and powerful over everyday Canadians. He’s refusing to crack down on big corporations that aren’t paying their share of Canadian taxes. Meanwhile, he’s telling people that he can’t afford to make housing and prescription drugs more affordable. Justin Trudeau has made his choice. I choose Canadians.” ",2019-10-18

Justin Trudeau’s No-Strings-Attached Approach Will Continue to Kill Manufacturing Jobs Back in 2015, Justin Trudeau said his top priority for Southern Ontario was “transitioning away from manufacturing-based employment as a driver in the economy.” (London Free Press) That’s one promise he actually kept. Just a few weeks ago, we learned that the Windsor Nemak engine block manufacturing plant will be closing down, putting 270 people out of work. This comes after the Liberals gave $5 million to the company without any guarantee that they would protect jobs. (CTV) In March, Toyota announced it will move its Toyota RAV4 hybrid production from its Cambridge plant to Kentucky, even after the Liberals gave the company $220 million in 2018. (London Free Press) In late 2018, the federal government wrote off a $1.1 billion loan to Fiat Chrysler (CBC). A few months later, the company laid off 1,500 workers at its Windsor plant. (CBC) And the end of GM’s vehicle production line in Oshawa is putting 2,300 people out of work – plus 10-15,000 more jobs at parts suppliers and other businesses. (Global) Since the Liberals eliminated the standalone Automotive Innovation Fund in 2017, only 3 auto projects have received federal funding under the Strategic Innovation Fund, which has no dedicated funding for auto projects and does not require companies to commit to keeping jobs in Canada.

The report also found that there is a large increase – from 33 % to 86% – in people’s ability to ""make ends meet"" and afford basic necessities such as food and rent when access to medicine is provided. “Across Canada, people are having to make impossible choices every day – cutting pills in half, choosing between paying rent or filling their prescription, or going without the drugs they need altogether,” said Davies. “It doesn’t have to be this way. Trudeau’s Liberals could have chosen to stand up for Canadians and bring in drug coverage, but instead they listened to lobbyists and chose not to act. New Democrats will do the right thing and invest in Canadians' health.” Even though experts say we could have better health care, lower costs, and savings for families, pharmacare has been stalled for years.

How Justin Trudeau Helped Doug Ford Cut Services At election time, Justin Trudeau likes to talk about fighting Conservatives. But a closer look at his record shows that he actually let Doug Ford cut affordable housing in Ontario. A recent Parliamentary Budget Office report showed that Trudeau left a giant loophole in his National Housing Strategy. The PBO found that because Trudeau didn’t require provincial matching funds to be additional to the province’s current housing spending levels, Doug Ford was actually able to cut housing funding by $161 million this year, despite receiving federal housing money. The PBO wrote:
		“Provinces and territories that already spend more than the federal government on housing could reduce funding for housing programs while still meeting the cost-matching requirements... Ontario’s 2019-20 Main Estimates reduced operating spending on housing programs from $944 million in 2018-19 to $866 million in 2019-20, and capital spending from $302 million to $219 million, despite $0.1 billion in additional funding provided to Ontario by CMHC in 2019-20.” (PBO, June Report) This policy allows the Liberals to talk about increasing affordable housing investments without any guarantee that affordable housing spending will actually go up. So where did Trudeau’s money go? While Ford cut services, he also cancelled a surtax on the rich, saving the highest-earning Ontarians $275 million a year. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau likes to talk about how bad Conservatives are, but he’s chosen to let Doug Ford cut services for people and give tax breaks to the rich. People can’t afford four more years of Justin Trudeau’s empty promises. I’ll fight hard to stop Conservative cuts all the time, not just during an election campaign.” ",2019-10-03

It’s time to look out for kids and protect our communities from the rising gang violence and organized crime that’s hurting everyday families in B.C.” An NDP government will create a $100 million fund dedicated to helping keep young people out of gangs, with a boost to programs that get youth involved in their community. New Democrats will also immediately create a dedicated RCMP anti-money laundering unit and put an end to hidden corporate ownership of real estate, to help crack down on tax evasion and fraud. “Young people who’ve been left behind need someone on their side. Preventing gang activity and tackling the housing crisis – those are the priorities of families here in Surrey and they need a government in Ottawa that takes them seriously,” said Singh. “We’re replacing empty talk with concrete action, because New Democrats are in it for you.” The NDP’s New Deal for People also gets results for B.C. families by investing in more affordable housing and fighting the climate crisis. New Democrats will safeguard the coast from the increased risk of oil spills, as a result of the high tanker traffic permitted by the Liberals, which would only be worsened by Big Oil-backed Conservatives and the Green Party that won’t rule out supporting them.

Trudeau Refuses to Take on Conservative Premiers on Child Care This morning at the Toronto Star editorial board, Justin Trudeau dodged repeated questions from journalists on his refusal to commit to a national affordable child care program. When asked why the Liberal government wasn’t taking action on child care, Trudeau passed the buck to provincial governments: “We can’t take on things that fundamentally it’s been shown, can be ably led, and should be ably led by the provinces.” (Video) Journalists pressed Trudeau on the “double standard” of promising to take action on pharmacare (a provincial responsibility) while refusing to push the provinces on child care. Trudeau refused to directly answer the question. Trudeau’s decision to pass the buck to the provinces is a sharp departure from his 2015 commitment to “to deliver affordable, high-quality, flexible, and fully inclusive child care for Canadian families.” As Child Care Now pointed out, Liberals have objectively not even tried to respect their promise. (1) But as Trudeau refuses to help families with child care costs, even Liberal MP Wayne Long recently described child care costs as a “crisis situation” and a recent study by the Canadian Centre for Policy alternatives found that child care fees have risen faster than inflation in 61% of Canadian cities.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “At a time when families are struggling with rising child care costs, they need a Prime Minister who isn’t afraid to take on Doug Ford and other conservatives. Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau is showing that despite his nice words, he’s refusing to actually stand up for Canadians struggling with the cost of living.

Last week, Singh called on Trudeau to stop negotiations to pressure Bolsonaro to change course to save the Amazon rainforest: “The Amazon rainforest is burning, and that’s not a crisis only for Brazil, it’s a crisis for humankind and for our planet. Once again, Justin Trudeau is putting the interest of rich corporations ahead of the fight against climate change by continuing free trade negotiations with President Bolsonaro.

This is another disturbing example of Justin Trudeau saying and tweeting pretty things in public, when behind closed doors he's doing business with the person responsible for the deforestation and devastation of the lungs of the planet. Experts have been clear: economic sanctions are the best tool we have to put pressure on President Bolsonaro, especially after he refused the help offered by the G7 members.

His 2015 platform promised “we will end the cycle of federal parties – of all stripes – setting arbitrary targets without a real federal/provincial/territorial plan in place.” But then the Liberals adopted Stephen Harper’s targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and are on path to meet them 200 years late. After the pressure of big polluters, Justin Trudeau gave them a carbon pricing exemption, delayed the Clean Fuel Standard and methane regulations until after the election. Under Justin Trudeau, Canada continues to spend around $3.3 billion a year on subsidies for big oil and gas companies, produce more greenhouse gas emissions per person than any other G20 economy and warm twice as fast as the rest of the world. The Liberal commitment to introduce legislated targets for emissions reductions could have been implemented more than a decade ago – if the Liberal-dominated Senate hadn’t let Jack Layton’s private member’s bill C-377 The Climate Change Accountability Act die on the order paper. And they blew past the 1997 Kyoto Protocol’s emissions targets by 30%.

Oshawa is bracing for the loss of thousands of jobs when vehicle production ends at the local GM plant this year. “Workers should never, ever feel abandoned by their government – but the Liberals and Conservatives have left workers in Oshawa on their own to deal with these devastating job cuts,” said Singh. “New Democrats will always support the auto sector, but we’ll do it with strings attached – jobs need to stay here in Canada.” Oshawa’s story isn’t unique. Communities across southern Ontario have seen hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs disappear on the watch of Liberal and Conservative governments alike. In some cases, rich companies have been allowed to walk away from Canadian workers after pocketing billions of dollars in tax breaks. “Auto workers deserve better than Liberal and Conservative only show up once the jobs have been lost,” said Singh. “Workers deserve a government that’s on their side, with a plan to attract and keep good-paying auto jobs in the long run.

NDP Statement on the Anniversary of the Dieppe Raid Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement: “On this day in 1942, Allied Forces launched a major raid on the French coastal port of Dieppe. The raid was a catastrophe. Of the 6,086 soldiers who made it ashore, 3,623 were killed, wounded, or captured. 907 of these soldiers were Canadian, the greatest loss of all participating Allied forces, prompting Churchill to state that it ‘was a Canadian contribution of the greatest significance to final victory’. The Dieppe raid was a significant setback, but it provided valuable lessons of what not to do in amphibious assaults, and laid the framework for the Normandy landings two years later, and the Allies’ eventual victory. On this Anniversary of the Dieppe Raid let us remember the great courage of our brave soldiers on that historic day, 77 years ago. Let’s also take a moment today to remember the families who lost their loved ones, the men and women who endured years of harsh treatment in prison, and those who came home forever scarred by a most brutal war.” ",2019-08-19

Dr. Jane Philpott Gives Liberals Bleak Prognosis for Pharmacare Plan Canadians know they can’t trust Justin Trudeau and the Liberals to deliver on pharmacare – and former Liberal Health Minister Dr. Jane Philpott is the latest to add her voice to the chorus casting doubt on Justin Trudeau’s latest promise. In an interview this afternoon, Dr. Philpott said: “I think the concern about this morning's announcement is the ambiguity that's associated with it. There are no timelines in terms of implementation. We don't want four years of negotiations to take place, we want implementation and people need to know, in fact is pharmacare going to be implemented or not?” (CTV Power Play) She continued: “Voters have a right to know, if they vote for Liberals, are they going to have a national single-payer universal public pharmacare system, or not?” Given the fact that the Liberals have been promising and failing to bring in pharmacare since 1997, Canadians can only assume the answer is no. Jagmeet Singh and the New Democrats have a real plan to deliver universal pharmacare for all Canadians in 2020 that will save people money and ensure everyone has access to the prescription drugs they need.

Another Environmentalist Joins the NDP The NDP offers a bold plan on climate change and good jobs
		LONGUEUIL — NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in the riding of Longueuil-Saint-Hubert to introduce the NDP’s candidate for the federal election on October 21, Éric Ferland. He was accompanied by the NDP's Deputy Leader and Environment Critic, Alexandre Boulerice. “I'm proud to welcome Éric Ferland as the NDP candidate for Longueuil-Saint-Hubert. Éric is a celebrated environmental activist, notably as a co-founder and Executive Director of the Foire Écosphère, which has been organizing the largest environment-related public events in Quebec for the past 14 years. The nominations of Hugo Latulippe and Éric Ferland show a growing consensus that the NDP is the only party with a clear plan and path forward to ensure that both people and the environment win.” While Éric Ferland has built a strong reputation in the environmental field, he also has an excellent reputation in the community and cultural sectors. On the political front, he served for 12 years as a municipal councillor in Frelighsburg, where he established recycling infrastructure, collaborated on forestry issues, and promoted an architectural integration and development plan. He is also the former Leader of the Quebec Green Party. ""Today, I am responding to Jagmeet Singh and the NDP's open invitation to progressives in Quebec. Quebecers want to fight the climate crisis! We could do so much more working together with a government that gives people the tools they need to make change,"" said Ferland. ""The NDP is the only party that recognizes the importance of responding to the climate emergency while addressing growing social inequalities."" ""One week after announcing Hugo Latulippe's candidacy, it is now environmentalist Eric Ferland’s turn to join the NDP,"" added Boulerice. “The decisions made by Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, like buying a pipeline with taxpayers' money, doesn't sit well with Quebecers. Only the NDP has the courage to take action to fight climate change, while delivering concrete help that improves everyone’s lives.” Power to Change: A New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs The NDP's plan to fight climate change: Our $15 billion climate plan will allow us to seriously address climate change while creating more than 300,000 jobs.
It will allow us to achieve ambitious, science-based targets for reducing our emissions.
It will create a Climate Bank to finance green energy projects.

Families Can’t Go Four More Years Without Drug and Dental Care NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says charging for medicine means families ‘pay up or get sick’ SASKATOON – Decades of Conservative and Liberal governments siding with big pharma, instead of with everyday Canadians, means families are forced to pay up, or get sick — and families can’t go four more years without drug and dental coverage, said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Because of Justin Trudeau’s choices, there are Canadians who sit at the kitchen table and cut their pills in half to make the bottle last longer,” said Singh. “There are moms and dads who have to make the heartbreaking decision to put off getting their kid’s cavity filled because money’s tight. Families can’t go four more years without the medicine they need. They can’t go four more years without getting their teeth checked.” Rather than expanding health care, the Conservatives would cut and squeeze health care even more. Justin Trudeau promised to help the middle class but did nothing to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, housing or other costs — and, as a result, families are falling further behind. Singh said it’s no surprise Trudeau won’t implement a universal pharmacare plan, since the record shows the Trudeau government has met behind closed doors with pharmaceutical and insurance companies more than 850 times. “No wonder the Liberals have blocked pharmacare and dental coverage. They’re not working for you, and I want people to know that you don’t have to settle for that. No one should have to spend four more years being forced to choose between paying up, or letting their family get sick,” said Singh. “People need a New Deal. Not Conservative cuts that would cost families more and force more folks to end up in jam-packed hospitals. Not a plan to keep protecting the profits of big pharma. A plan to make life affordable and healthy for you and your kids.” Singh’s platform commits to introducing a national universal pharmacare plan by the end of 2020, saving each family more than $500 a year, even if they already have insurance; and a dental plan to provide coverage for millions of families. The NDP’s platform includes a one per cent tax on wealth over $20 million, raising $70 billion over 10 years — funding better, expanded health care. ",2019-10-04

NDP Will Help Communities Adapt to Climate Change GATINEAU – Today, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh underlined the Liberals’ failure to address the climate emergency, saying that Justin Trudeau chose to protect corporate interests above the wellbeing of Canadians. “Too many Canadians are dealing with disasters like flooding that destroy their homes and disrupt their lives. Justin Trudeau says he agrees there is a climate crisis, but he doesn’t seem to get it. He’s spent billions on a pipeline, while under-funding support for communities impacted by disasters like flooding,” says Singh. “We can do better for people. We have a bold climate plan that replaces pretty words with real action.” In 2015, the Conservative government raised the threshold for provinces to qualify for federal compensation for disasters – and the Trudeau Liberals not only kept this change but also purchased the Trans-Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion, while leaving communities scrambling for funding to fight flooding and forest fires. “The Liberals promise one thing during election, and deliver another in government. While families here in Gatineau and across the country struggle with the growing threat of floods and other climate-related disasters, Justin Trudeau was more focused on buying a pipeline than on getting them help,” added Singh. “We’re going to make different choices. We have a plan to help communities protect people from the impacts of climate change right now.” New Democrats have a real plan to confront the climate crisis and limit warming to 1.5 degrees. The NDP would expand federal funding by $2.5 billion to help communities respond to disasters and adapt infrastructure to withstand floods and other extreme weather events. This is all part of the NDP’s bold $15 billion plan to lower emissions, protect our natural environment, create 300,000 good jobs, and fight the climate crisis. ",2019-09-22

NDP Will Help More Canadians Get the Dental Care They Need It’s time to expand health care coverage from head-to-toe SUDBURY – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced the unprecedented commitment of making the first step towards free dental care for all Canadians. Including dental care in our health care system for those who don’t get the care they need will help millions of Canadians. ""No one should have to deal with the pain or lifelong damage of going without dental care,"" said Singh. ""Some people have workplace insurance plans – but millions of Canadians don't have any dental coverage at all. Trudeau's Liberals refuse to even consider helping these Canadians. This doesn't make sense. We need to ensure people are getting the care they need."" Millions of Canadians don’t visit the dentist every year because they can't afford to. Liberals and Conservatives chose to ignore these needs. New Democrats will work together with provincial partners and health professionals to expand Medicare to include dental services. ""Our Denticare plan is a down payment on Tommy Douglas' vision – comprehensive dental care as part of our healthcare system,"" added Singh. ""Unlike the Liberals and the Conservatives, New Democrats are going to help people who need it, right now."" This is all part of the NDP's New Deal for People to make life more affordable for families, young people and seniors. Facts Our plan will extend public dental care coverage to 4.3 million Canadians.
We will put in place a national dental care plan to help uninsured Canadians with household incomes below $90,000, starting right away in 2020.
Dental care will be free for housholds making under $70,000, with a sliding copayment for those who earn between $70,000 and $90,000.
Under the NDP’s Denticare plan, a family of four that has a household income of $70,000 or less would save at least $1,240 if they received the recommended dental examinations and cleanings in a single year, and if each child was treated for a single cavity.
Our Denticare plan is a first step towards Tommy Douglas’ vision – comprehensive dental care as part of our healthcare system. He championed the idea more than thirty years ago: ""The ultimate goal of Medicare must be to keep people well rather than just patching them up when they get sick... It means expanding and improving Medicare by providing pharmacare and denticare programs."" (The Future of Medicare, 1984)
Almost 20% of Canadians avoid the dentist every year because of the cost.
Ignoring dental care needs end up costing our health care system. Emergency room visits because of dental emergencies cost taxpayers at least $155 million annually but often don’t address underlying dental issues, leading to return visits and ongoing pressures on our health care system.
The Liberals have refused to even consider helping Canadians with their dental care needs. In fact, Liberal Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor recently said, with respect to dental care, that “no federal investments are being made”. ",2019-09-18

(Health Canada, 9 Aug 2019) Justin Trudeau’s Liberals met with big pharmaceutical and insurance companies 850 times while refusing to take real action on pharmacare. 2. Big Telecoms

The result is an almost fifty million dollar break for Bell, Rogers and Telus while Canadians are stuck with sky high cell phone and internet bills. 3. Big Oil
		Justin Trudeau told Canadians he would take on climate change. Instead, he broke his promise to end billions in fossil fuel subsidies and bought a $4.5 billion pipeline on the public dime – all while meeting 1,500 times with oil company lobbyists. 4. Real Estate Speculators
		Housing prices are skyrocketing out of reach for Canadians. One-in-five renters are being forced to put more than half of their paycheque into housing. (Georgia Straight) Justin Trudeau has refused to take on the wealthy speculators that treat housing as a cash source, not a place to live. 5. SNC-Lavalin

This report proves that the Liberal government has put the wealthy and the well-connected above the law – and the Prime Minister himself is directly responsible,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. Commissioner Dion was clear that SNC-Lavalin “overwhelmingly stood to benefit from Ms. Wilson-Raybould's intervention”, and that he has “no doubt that the result of Mr. Trudeau's influence would have furthered SNC-Lavalin's interests”. He concluded that Trudeau’s actions were against the constitutional principles of prosecutorial independence and the rule of law. “Justin Trudeau is not who he pretends to be,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay). “Behind closed doors, we now have proof that this Prime Minister went so far as to break the law to cut backroom deals for his corporate friends and to benefit his political party.

NDP’s Rudy Turtle Reacts to Liberal's Failure to Reach Agreement with Grassy Narrows KENORA – NDP candidate Rudy Turtle (Kenora) condemned Trudeau's Liberals failure to reach an agreement over an on-reserve care facility for people in Grassy Narrows First Nation suffering from the effects of mercury poisoning before the dissolution of Parliament. Trudeau’s Liberals had years to come to an agreement and solve the problem, but they didn’t. “Children and elders are suffering from mercury poisoning every day in Grassy Narrows,” said Turtle. “Justin Trudeau promised to build a treatment center to help our people. He had four years to fix the problem, but he failed. This isn’t how Reconciliation works.” Grassy Narrows families have suffered from mercury poisoning because of a corporate chemical-dumping crime that poisoned the English and Wabigoon rivers in the 1960s and ‘70s. The Liberal government promised a much-needed mercury care facility to care for the sickest residents — but has been stalling, trying to get away with delivering much less than promised, or perhaps nothing at all. “Conservative and Liberal governments came and left, and the people of Grassy Narrows are still getting sick,” added Turtle. “When elected, I will work in Ottawa to ensure that Grassy Narrows is heard so we can finally build a treatment center to help people suffering from mercury poisoning and clean the river.” For New Democrats, Reconciliation is at the heart of our work. We will honour our treaties, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, close the health gap and renew the relationship between Canada and First Nations with an Action Plan on Reconciliation. Facts An independent study by Japanese researchers found that more than 90% of people in Grassy Narrows and nearby Wabaseemoong suffer from symptoms of mercury poisoning.
A 2015 scientific report found that there is ongoing contamination in lakes and rivers upstream of Grassy Narrows.
A 2018 report found that mercury exposure was linked to serious issues in children's health, including learning disabilities, language or speech disorders, anemia, and visual problems.
Only 6% of people in Grassy Narrows currently receive compensation from the mercury disability board, which relies on outdated medical criteria to assess eligibility.
Justin Trudeau promised in 2017 to solve the issue ""once and for all,"" and then called it ""very much a provincial issue"" two months later.

Cancellation of Bell Service shows Liberal Failure: NDP Liberals are more interested in protecting corporate profits than serving Canadians WINDSOR — Today, NDP Critic for Innovation, Science, and Economic Development, Brian Masse (Windsor West), pointed to Bell Canada’s cancellation of the planned service rollout to 200,000 households as proof that the Liberals are failing to create more competition in the telecom sector to make life more affordable for people. “You can’t have a real plan to deal with telecom affordability and service without the courage to take on the well-connected telecom giants,” stated Masse.  “What’s shocking isn’t that the Liberals’ plan failed, but that it failed in just four days. Bell’s display of corporate greed to save a rounding error in their revenue is leading them to abandon 200,000 underserved Canadian households. Bell’s customers wait on hold longer than it took them to protect their price gouging.” Bell announced this week that it will reduce its broadband Internet build-out for smaller towns and rural communities, abandoning 200,000 households, in response to a CRTC decision that lowered wholesale rates for third-party Internet resellers. “For decades, Conservative and Liberal governments have abandoned Canadian consumers by allowing unfair competition to fester in the telecom market,” said Masse. “The result is that Canadians pay among the highest prices in the world for cellphone and internet service, while those living in rural and remote communities have no service at all. The Liberals’ plan will protect telecom company profits while doing nothing to guarantee Canadians wireless or high-speed internet access.” New Democrats believe that no matter where you live in Canada, you should be able to stay connected – without breaking the bank over unfair gouging.

The promise had no timelines and funding fell far short of what would be needed for a real pharmacare program. Canadians know that the Liberals can’t be trusted to bring in pharmacare – they’ve been promising to introduce pharmacare since 1997. After the election, it never materializes.

Bold NDP Climate Plan Boosts Locally Grown Food KINGSTON – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh brought his bold climate plan to a local farmers market to highlight the role of local food in addressing the climate crisis. “The time for delay and denial is over – we need to act. Our plan to fight climate change will create at least 300,000 new jobs, save families money, and take on big polluters. We’re going to follow the science and do what’s needed to keep warming below 1.5 degrees,” said Singh. At the Kingston Farmer’s Market, Singh talked with local farmers about how the changing climate is impacting them, as growing conditions become more unpredictable. Despite the importance of our food system in confronting the climate crisis, Liberal and Conservative governments have left farmers to struggle with a rapidly changing climate and mounting financial stress on their own – while Canadian families want more access to local food. “When we support local farmers – everyone wins. Buying locally grown products is good for the environment and the economy,” said Singh. “When it comes to the climate crisis, we’re all in this together – and more healthy local food on Canadians’ plates is part of the solution.” The NDP’s New Deal for People commits to a Canadian Food Strategy that will help connect Canadians to farmers with initiatives like local food hubs that link local producers to consumers, and community-supported agriculture, so people can enjoy healthy, local food while doing their part to tackle climate change.

NDP Worried about Liberals Secretive Plans to Privatize Airport Security Screening BRAMPTON – Today, the NDP is calling on Justin Trudeau’s Liberals to stop the privatization of Canadian Airport Transportation Security Authority (CATSA) behind closed doors and without worker representatives. Workers’ knowledge and years of experience absolutely need to be taken into account before government makes major modifications. “This government has chosen to ignore stakeholders and instead rely on the biased opinions of those they hire to justify privatization. This consultation process has not been open or transparent. It is shameful that workers and their representatives have not been included at all stages of this transition. The knowledge and expertise CATSA workers and their representatives have is crucial to protecting public interest and public money,” said NDP candidate Saranjit Singh (Brampton East). Not only would privatization result in higher ticket prices and erode safety standards, it would also have major impacts on workers. The Liberals show a complete lack of understanding about the effects these changes will have for workers and the traveling public. “Trudeau needs to give assurance that privatization of services will not impact the cost of travel for Canadians as well of the quality of security services,” said Stan Pickthall, General Vice-President of IAMAW. “Time and time again, we have seen Trudeau favouring the interests of big businesses and trading them for the interests of ordinary Canadians. The Liberals are working in coordination with Scheer’s Conservatives to ensure worker’s input is bypassed. Let’s make sure this will not happen again.” The NDP believes that CATSA’s funding model should be reviewed to make it stable and predictable to ensure that international standards are met. A New Democrat government commits to review the Liberals’ decision and make sure to put the interest of workers and Canadians first. – 30 – Facts: From January to July, 2019, 29.4 million passengers passed through Canada’s busiest hub, Toronto Pearson International Airport, an increase from last year.
A boom in the airlines industry will bring more passengers at every Canadian airport, which requires not just efficiency but also meeting strict safety standards that protect the traveling public.
During the budgetary process, New Democrats tried to stop the privatization of CATSA to avoid costs being passed on to the public, erosion of safety and working conditions of airport workers.

NDP Will Fight For Families Left Behind By Liberals VANCOUVER – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wrapped up his swing through British Columbia by meeting with young people and families who have been left behind and let down by Justin Trudeau and the Liberals. “It’s hard for working families to get ahead when the Liberals keep giving breaks to the richest corporations, and forcing the rest of us to pay the price,” said Singh. “Over the last four years, Justin Trudeau had no problem finding billions of dollars in tax giveaways for his corporate friends – but he left Canadians waiting for help on drug costs, child care and finding an affordable place to call home.” Singh noted that after over twenty years of promising pharmacare, the Liberals appear to have completely given up on their commitment. Their recent platform failed to specifically dedicate a single dollar to pharmacare, dental care or making rent more affordable. “Like Liberals do every election, Justin Trudeau is trying to scare Canadians into settling for less – but New Democrats know that you deserve better,” added Singh. “Families are struggling, and they need help now. We’ve got a bold plan to make life more affordable, strengthen health care and confront the climate crisis. New Democrats will fight for you.” It’s all part of the NDP’s New Deal for People to create 500,000 affordable child care spaces within four years, launch a universal pharmacare program, bring in no-cost dental coverage for working families who need it, expand affordable housing and give struggling families immediate help with rent, and lift the burden of student debt by cancelling all federal loan interest.

NDP Statement on Labour Day Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement: Labour Day is a time to celebrate the many advances made by the labour movement in Canada over the past decades. From the 44-hour work week to paid maternity leave, many significant battles have been fought and won. New Democrats are proud to have walked with labour all these decades. But the fight to defend workers is not over. Precarious jobs are on the rise, wages are stagnating, and everyday costs are rising. And to top it all, Liberal and Conservative governments keep giving breaks to the richest, while ordinary Canadians are forced to pay the price. Workers deserve a government that puts them first – and that’s why Jagmeet and the NDP are committed to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 right away – and growing that to a living wage.We’ll also make sure workers have more protections, and that part-time and contract workers are fairly compensated. Millions of Canadians are struggling to pay the bills every month – even when they work full time. While the cost of housing, medication, and other necessities have skyrocketed, wages haven’t kept up – and that’s because decades of Liberal and Conservative governments have sided with big corporations instead of people. Justin Trudeau promised he’d bring fairness to workplaces across Canada, but he’s sided with big business and betrayed workers, too. Today, to celebrate Labour Day, Jagmeet and the NDP are commiting to ensuring that every Canadian worker is treated fairly – and that if you work full time, you can make ends meet. Happy Labour Day!

Reality Check: Conservatives Open to Bending the Rules for Corporate Friends Scheer too cozy with big corporation to speak out OTTAWA – When it comes to standing up for Canadians and the rule of law against powerful corporate interests, it’s clear that Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives would have chosen their insider friends from SNC-Lavalin too. Andrew Scheer met with SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce to discuss deferred prosecution agreements as recently as May 2018. (Toronto Star, Feb. 10 2019)
Following that meeting, Scheer would not speak out against a secret deal for SNC-Lavalin: “when asked if Scheer had a position on whether SNC-Lavalin should get such a deal, Harrison would only say that Scheer ‘is opposed to politicians interfering to get charges dropped for accused corporate criminals.’” (Toronto Star, Feb. 10 2019).
In March 2019, Scheer continued to sidestep the question of what he would do when companies break the law, saying that deferred prosecution agreements are “not the issue” he’s concerned with in regard to the SNC-Lavalin controversy. (Global News, March 23 2019)
Scheer’s reluctance to take on corporations that break the law isn’t surprising when you consider the Conservative record: in 2013 it was revealed that at least three companies had been given federal contracts despite violating government integrity policies (iPolitics, June 4 2013) – and in May 2015, the CEO of SNC-Lavalin stated that he had made efforts to seek a settlement with the previous government in order to avoid a lengthy criminal trial. (Trudeau II Report, p. 11) But the coziness between big corporations and Scheer’s Conservatives does not stop there: In April 2019, the Conservatives opposed an NDP motion opposing corporate influence over the Government of Canada (Vote No. 1299)

Renters NDP takes action for British Columbians where Liberals have failed CAMPBELL RIVER, B.C. — Help is on the way for Canadians struggling to pay their rent every month with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh’s plan to offer rental benefits of up to $5,000 each year. “Instead of taking the housing crisis seriously, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have made phony promises. Their plan actually spends less on affordable housing than during the previous ten years under Stephen Harper’s Conservatives,” said Singh. “If we want to fix this mess, we need to have the courage to act. That’s why New Democrats will deliver immediate help for families who are struggling most to pay their rent.” The NDP’s rental benefit will be targeted at families who are paying more than 30 per cent of their pre-tax income on housing, as immediate help to make ends meet. Trudeau has told renters to wait for help, while spending 4.5 billion taxpayer dollars on a pipeline and refusing to take on the money laundering and speculation that has driven up housing prices in B.C. “We know it will take time to build the affordable housing people need; this is about getting families that are hurting the most relief right away – not waiting a decade from now, like the Liberals are proposing,” said Singh. The NDP’s New Deal for People also delivers a bold plan to fight the climate crisis, lower cell phone bills, and provide dental care and universal prescription drug coverage to make life more affordable for families in B.C. and across Canada. – 30 – Facts: According to an analysis by the PBO, the Liberals’ National Housing Strategy spends 19% less on affordable housing as a proportion of GDP than the previous 10 years, including under the Conservatives. [1]
Experts have accused the Liberals of double-counting funding and actually helping fewer low-income people than in the past. [2]
The Liberals' “Canada Housing Benefit” is too small and too late.
It won’t be fully phased-in to cover 300,000 families until 2027-28 – almost a full decade from now.
An average benefit of $2,500 won’t actually close the gap between people’s incomes and affordable rent, the PBO found. [3]

Trudeau’s Shameful Record of Failing Indigenous Children In 2015, Justin Trudeau made big promises to make life better for Indigenous children. Instead, he fought continuously in court to avoid funding Indigenous child welfare. Since being ordered in 2016 by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to fix the discriminatory underfunding of Indigenous child services, Trudeau’s government has been hit with four non-compliance orders and 48 children in Ontario have died. But last year, he found $14 billion to give away to big corporations. This is just the latest in a long list of failures to make things right for Indigenous children: After the government received an urgent request for suicide prevention funding from Wapekeka First Nation, they said it was an “awkward time” to fund it. After several deaths by suicide in the community, the Tribunal connected it directly to the government’s refusal to comply.
They spent $110,000 to deny dental coverage for a child who needed a $6,000 procedure – only to lose in court.
Their bills to reform the child welfare system and fund Indigenous language education were blasted by experts for not including any funding to improve services. Instead of backing up his words with action, Justin Trudeau fought Indigenous children in court while handing billions in giveaways to corporations and the wealthiest Canadians. ",2019-10-04

Trudeau Propped Up Harper and Backed Billions in Corporate Tax Cuts Lately, Justin Trudeau has been working overtime to convince Canadians he was part of a “progressive opposition” to Stephen Harper. But Trudeau’s record at the time shows he was not so progressive and he didn’t do all that much opposing. In 2009, the Liberals had an opportunity to join with Jack Layton to defeat Stephen Harper’s budget and block billions in corporate giveaways. Trudeau and the Liberals voted for that budget instead, locking in Harper’s corporate tax cut plan from 19.5% in 2008 to 15% in 2012. That cut gave away $55 billion over five years. When Trudeau came to power in 2015, he kept those tax breaks in place. And Just last year he piled on another $14 billion in giveaways. Between 2006 and 2009, the “progressive” Liberals propped up Harper in 79 confidence motions while Jack Layton and the NDP consistently tried to defeat Harper. So while Justin Trudeau claims he “couldn’t” stop Stephen Harper in opposition, perhaps a more honest word is “wouldn’t.” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Again and again, Justin Trudeau has chosen the rich and powerful over people. He gives Canadians pretty words at election time, and then stands up for multimillionaires when he’s behind closed doors. We’ll ensure corporations and the super-rich pay their share so we can make life better and more affordable for everyday Canadians.” ",2019-10-16

A home people can afford, including massive investments in housing, real action on money laundering and a tax on foreign speculators.

Making cell phone and internet bills more affordable by putting in place a price cap to make sure that Canadians aren’t paying more than the global average for their cell phone and internet bills.
Ensuring the super-wealthy are paying their fair share by introducing a super wealth tax, closing tax loopholes, and ending giveaways for the richest companies and individuals. “We can and must change the way Canadians choose their government, so that people feel they can vote for what they believe, not against what they fear,” said Singh. “We can change the system so that every vote counts no matter where you live.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP Health Critic Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway) are calling on the Trudeau government to join the Government of British Columbia to take civil legal action on behalf of Canadians - and investigate whether criminal charges are warranted. ""Each and every day for the last two years, 10 Canadian families lost a loved one because of the opioid crisis,"" said Singh. ""Drug companies played a role in the American opioid crisis, and they may be legally responsible for the devastation opioids caused in Canada, too. Justin Trudeau's Liberals need to stop protecting big pharma at the expense of people and communities."" Trudeau's Liberals have refused to join British Columbia's legal action to seek compensation from drug companies for the costs of addressing the opioid crisis. To date, Trudeau and the Liberals have taken no steps to investigate the role that drug companies may have played in fueling the opioid crisis. Since the last election, the Liberals have received more than $32,000 in donations from people at pharmaceutical and insurance corporations, and have met with their lobbyists at least 875 times. ""Families have been torn apart, and lives have been devastated. With the Johnson & Johnson decision, grieving parents in Canada are left to wonder if opioid manufacturers also marketed these products to Canadians and Canadian doctors in a way that skirted federal law,"" added Davies. ''It's time to launch civil action, and a federal investigation to determine whether criminal charges are warranted against opioid manufacturers and distributors for their alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis. Families who lost a loved one to this crisis deserve answers."" Jagmeet Singh and the NDP have vowed, if elected, to immediately declare a public health emergency and launch an investigation into the role drug companies may have played in fueling the opioid crisis, seeking meaningful financial compensation for the costs of this crisis. The NDP is also committed to supporting overdose prevention sites and expanding access to addictions treatment. Facts: Last summer, the NDP government of British Columbia filed a civil lawsuit against drug companies to recoup the enormous costs incurred by that province in addressing the crisis. This year, the government of Ontario announced they would join B.C.'s lawsuit.
In addition to Monday's ruling, the United States Department of Justice has already secured criminal pleas and, along with dozens of states, over $600 million in damages from opioid manufacturers for misbranding offences in that country.
From 2011 to 2016 alone, provincial drug plans across Canada spent $548.6 million on medications to treat addictions to prescription and illicit opioids. Hundreds of millions of dollars more were spent by governments for emergency room visits, first responders and treatment programs. ",2019-08-27

Singh to Trudeau: Why Are You Letting Multimillionaires Off the Hook? Yesterday, Jagmeet Singh challenged Justin Trudeau on why he won't tax the super-rich to pay for services Canadians badly need. Trudeau used to talk about making the rich pay their share. But after four years in power, Canada’s richest 87 families hold as much wealth as 12 million Canadians. Trudeau's 2019 platform includes nothing that asks the richest 1% to pay more, and offers nothing to Canadians who can't afford basic needs like rent and medication. Does Justin Trudeau think that’s fair? Singh said: “We know that Mr. Trudeau is not willing to tax the richest Canadians. We put it to him, and people have asked him, would he be willing to put in place our wealth tax on the super wealthy? He hasn’t said yes.” “No other party is willing to say we’re going to make sure that the richest Canadians, those who have fortunes of over $20 million, pay their fair share. Everyone else, Canadians, hardworking families, middle-class families, they’re paying their fair share. They don’t need to pay any more of the burden. “We’re not going to raise taxes on middle-class and working-class families. But we’re asking the richest to pay their fair share. Mr. Trudeau is not willing to do that.” Singh has made implementing a super-wealth tax on fortunes over $20 million an urgent priority in the next Parliament.

Now, Justin Trudeau thinks millionaires are already paying enough taxes. But that hasn’t stopped him from campaigning on it. Last night, he said the Liberals believe in giving “less help to millionaires.” He bragged about giving “nothing to the 1%.” But his platform contains no measures to raise revenue from Canada’s ultra-rich. Who else is getting nothing new from Trudeau? Canadians struggling with the cost of prescription drugs, dental care, and housing. Jagmeet Singh has made implementing a super-wealth tax on fortunes over $20 million an urgent priority in the next Parliament. With so many Canadians who need help with rising costs, why won’t Justin Trudeau tax multimillionaires? ",2019-10-13

NDP Brings New Deal for People to Toronto In this election, the people of Toronto know that the NDP is In It for You OTTAWA – Today, in Toronto-Danforth surrounded by candidates and a packed theatre of 800 supporters, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh talked about his New Deal for People that invests in the services people need, makes life more affordable and fights the climate crisis. “For too long, Liberal and Conservative governments in Ottawa keep making life easier for the rich, and harder for everybody else,” said Singh. “People in Toronto, and throughout the country, are working hard, and are just looking to be treated fairly. These are the people the NDP has always worked for. These are the people I’m in it for.” Singh was introduced by former NDP MP Olivia Chow and Toronto City Councillor Mike Layton at the event, which took place in Jack Layton’s former riding of Toronto-Danforth. He talked about the high cost of housing, expanding Medicare head-to-toe and confronting the climate crisis. In the face of Doug Ford’s Conservative cuts, people in Toronto have been let down by Justin Trudeau’s pretty words and empty promises. Trudeau has been clear that he will not stand up to Ford’s cuts to child care and health services. “Liberals and Conservatives have shown they are in it for their rich friends, not for you,” added Singh. “New Democrats are different. We are offering A New Deal for People. We won’t just say the right things, we will actually do them. We want people in Toronto to know we are all in it for you! And when Canadians come to choose who to trust with their vote: I want them to know – we won’t let them down.” ",2019-09-08

NDP Will Give Health Benefits to Part-Time, Contract Workers The NDP will also lower the cost of cell and internet plans
		TORONTO – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pledged his support for workers struggling with unpredictable work with his plan to immediately bring-in pharmacare and dentacare programs for people. “So many Canadians don’t have workplace benefits any more, and have been left on their own to figure out how to pay for sky-high cell and internet services they need to work,” said Singh. “Bill Morneau – the Liberals' multi-millionaire Finance Minister – had the nerve to tell young people that they ‘have to accept’ an uncertain job future. We can do so much better.” The Liberals have been promising Canadians a pharmacare program for over twenty years and have refused to deliver – leaving workers on their own. And Conservatives will make things even worse, with cuts to the services we all count on. People in Toronto are seeing that with Doug Ford, and Andrew Scheer will do the same thing – it’s what Conservatives do. “It’s a story that’s we’ve heard for so long – Liberals and Conservative promise help during elections, but they get into power and side with the wealthiest,” said Singh. “With different choices we can get better results. New Democrats are going to fight to get you the benefits you need – pharmacare and dental care at no cost, and cutting your cell phone bills every month.” Jagmeet’s New Deal for People includes pharmacare and dentacare programs to make life more affordable for millions of people in Canada, starting right away in 2020. – 30 – Facts: Universal pharmacare and dental care for uninsured Canadians are all part of the NDP’s New Deal for People, which has a number of other measures to help contract, part-time and gig economy workers.
These measures include making sure that part-time and contract workers are compensated equally to full-time workers, banning unpaid internships outside educational programs, putting in place a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour and raising it to a living wage within four years, and immediately eliminate interest on federal student debt for all existing and future student loans.

Justin Trudeau’s Flip Flop Shows his Child Care Promises are Empty This morning, Justin Trudeau claimed he will invest in child care. But just 11 days ago at the Toronto Star editorial board, Justin Trudeau dodged repeated questions from journalists on his refusal to commit to a national affordable child care program. When asked why the Liberal government wasn’t taking action on child care, Trudeau passed the buck to provincial governments: “We can’t take on things that fundamentally it’s been shown, can be ably led, and should be ably led by the provinces.” (Video) This is a sharp departure from his 2015 commitment to “to deliver affordable, high-quality, flexible, and fully inclusive child care for Canadian families.” As Child Care Now pointed out, Liberals fell far short of their 2015 promise. (1) Even Liberal MP Wayne Long recently described child care costs as a “crisis situation” and a recent study by the Canadian Centre for Policy alternatives found that child care fees have risen faster than inflation in 61% of Canadian cities. (2) NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Families shouldn’t have to choose between having kids and having a career. Justin Trudeau said he would make child care affordable, but he broke that promise. Just a few days ago, Justin Trudeau was telling Canadians that child care was a provincial responsibility. It’s clear that people who are struggling with high child care costs can’t trust Justin Trudeau’s pretty words and empty promises.” ",2019-09-16

But instead of addressing climate change, the Liberals spent billions of taxpayer dollars buying an oil pipeline that will threaten our environment and violate Indigenous rights – and the Conservatives don’t believe we’re in a climate crisis at all.” While Liberals bend the rules to let big polluters off the hook, New Democrats are committed to making sure the workers and communities most impacted by climate change get the benefits of the clean economy of the future. Singh underlined that the NDP’s bold plan would create jobs right here in Winnipeg by electrifying transit fleets, help distribute Manitoba’s clean power to other provinces, and make sure that Indigenous communities are full and equal partners in Canada’s efforts to confront the climate crisis. “Manitobans know the impacts of climate change on their day to day lives all too well. We need to take action now – and our plan will bring good jobs and prosperity to people here in Winnipeg and across the province,” added Singh. It’s all part of the NDP’s New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs to build a clean economy that works better for families. – 30 – Facts: Under the NDP’s plan, a new Canadian Climate Bank will provide support for interested provinces to inter-connect power grids to distribute clean power, like Manitoba’s hydro power, across the country.

JOHN’S – New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh joined NDP candidate Jack Harris in St. John’s on Tuesday to discuss their bold plan to make everyday life more affordable and services more available for people in Newfoundland and Labrador. “People in St. John’s are worried about the rising cost of living. The Trudeau Liberals have spent years focused on helping out their rich corporate friends, making it harder and harder for regular people to get ahead,” said Singh. “That’s why I’m so proud to have great candidates like Jack Harris standing up for Newfoundland and Labrador in Ottawa. Jack has a proven record of fighting for families, for the health care they need, the jobs and opportunity they deserve, and the affordability to help them get ahead.” Singh is in St. John’s sharing his New Deal for People – a bold plan to make life more affordable all while addressing issues like climate change, expanding quality health care services, and working for meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous communities. The NDP’s New Deal offers 300,000 new jobs across Canada, expands and improves Employment Insurance, and creates a national pharmacare program to cover all Canadians — the first step in the plan to cover dental care and vision care. The New Deal pays for the improvements by having those who have more than $20 million in wealth pay a little more, along with closing tax loopholes for the super-wealthy and mega-corporations. Singh was joined by Harris, NDP candidate for St. John’s East and MP from 2008 to 2015, and former leader of the provincial NDP. “I know that many people are worrying about making ends meet in St. John’s East and want strong representation in Ottawa. With the NDP, we have a plan that stands up for everyday people – investing in health care and child care – and making sure everyone can afford to build a good life,” said Harris. “That’s why I’m more motivated than ever to bring this fight to Ottawa.” ",2019-09-03

Jagmeet’s plan will save young people $1,200 a year on cell phone fees, student debt, dentacare and pharmacare, and up to $5,000 a year on rent. “In 2015, Justin Trudeau made a lot of big promises. But four years later, the wealthiest in Canada are doing better, but things aren’t any easier for young people starting out,” said Singh. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can make different choices to get better results for young people.” Access to education should never depend on how much money your parents make or how much debt you can carry. Barriers to quality, affordable education have been set up by Liberal and Conservative governments – and it’s time to tear them down. New Democrats have a plan for young people to remove all interest from federal student loans – saving a graduate with an average loan approximately $3,400 over ten years. “Justin Trudeau walked away from his promises on pharmacare and electoral reform, but managed to find $14 billion in special tax breaks for his corporate friends. And this election, he’s telling young people to settle for less,” said Singh. “New Democrats are different. We’re in it for you, and we’re ready to make big changes to deliver a better future for young people in every part of Canada.” The NDP’s vision will also fight the climate crisis with a bold plan to defend our land, water and coasts, while creating good-paying jobs that young people can rely on.

New Democrats will bring in a tax on the multimillionaires alongside tougher enforcement to stop tax evasion both in Canada, and off-shore. “Families shouldn’t have to worry about their future. They deserve a government that is actually on their side. Canadians deserve prescription drugs covered by Medicare, and expanded health care services to cover people head-to-toe – and we can do this when the very richest pay their fair share,” concluded Singh. – 30 – Facts: The NDP’s super-wealth tax would apply a 1% tax on fortunes above $20 million.
This will be applied annually and include real estate, luxury items and investments.

It will be paired with boosted enforcement against tax evasion and penalties for millionaires who try to evade paying taxes, including regular CRA audits and third-party valuation of assets.

Under public pressure, he eventually let her testify to the Ethics Commissioner and the Justice Committee – but his waiver only applied to selective time periods and didn’t allow her to discuss the controversial Cabinet shuffle that saw her moved from Justice to Veterans’ Affairs. And the Ethics Commissioner said his investigation hit roadblocks because Trudeau refused to waive Cabinet confidence for nine others who said they had relevant information.

Vaughan and Liberals Can’t Escape Empty Promises on Affordable Housing In June, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office found that Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan’s housing plan spends 19% less as a percentage of GDP than the Conservative plan did. Since then, Adam Vaughan has worked overtime to discredit the independent PBO’s analysis. But it’s not just the PBO that says the Liberals have failed. University of Toronto Professor David Hulchanski said that “the Liberal Party and even CMHC have mixed all these together into big sounding amounts, as if a great deal is happening. But not much is happening in terms of meeting housing need and existing spending on housing remains at a historically low percentage of the federal budget.” Hulchanksi has also described the housing strategy as “a public relations gimmick.” In August, Vaughan claimed a planned sale of the Queens Quay lands without affordable housing was out of government’s hands. The next week, the Liberals reversed course in the face of pressure from Jagmeet Singh and Councillor Joe Cressy. Meanwhile in Toronto, there are no neighbourhoods left where a person putting in full-time work for minimum wage can afford a modest one-bedroom apartment.

And he addressed the social values New Democrats share with Quebecers. “Like Quebecers, when it comes to abortion, I firmly believe in the right to choose. I believe in the right to die with dignity. I believe in the separation of church and state, and I believe in LGBTQ rights, including marriage equality,” said Singh. “For four years, Justin Trudeau has chosen to make life easier for the wealthy and the well-connected. He has let down people and made life tougher for you. Despite all that, Justin Trudeau is telling you that you have no choice in this election. You have a choice. This time, you can vote for what you believe in.” ",2019-10-16

Reality Check: Liberals will Always Side with Big Telecom Companies Justin Trudeau is hinting once again that he might consider taking actions desperately needed to bring down the cost of cell phone bills — but only after an election, and people aren't buying it. ""Trudeau wants us to believe if we give him another chance, he won’t let us down this time. Meanwhile, Trudeau’s Liberal government met with well-connected lobbyists for the telecom industry 565 times since taking office, and gave Bell, Rogers and Telus close to $50 million in subsidies and more than $700 million in contracts. Seems clear whose side Trudeau is on,” said NDP Innovation, Science and Economic Development Critic and candidate Brian Masse (Windsor West). Trudeau's record on big telecom companies includes: Two months ago, the Trudeau Liberals voted down a concrete plan that would have ended price-gouging for essential cell and internet services.
Since 2013, lobbyists and members of the four largest and richest telecommunications companies have donated $41,861 to the Liberal Party of Canada.

Jagmeet Singh Launches Election Campaign This election, Jagmeet is In It for You
		LONDON – Today, surrounded by candidates and supporters, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh launched his 2019 election. Jagmeet’s New Deal for People invests in services people need, makes life more affordable and fights the climate crisis. “For too long, Liberal and Conservative governments have been making life easier for the rich, and harder for everybody else,” said Singh. “Throughout the country I meet people working hard, looking to be treated fairly and just wanting to live a good life. These are the people the NDP has always worked for. These are the people I’m in it for.” Four years ago, Justin Trudeau charmed us with pretty words and empty promises. It’s clear Justin Trudeau is not who he pretended to be, and people have been paying the price. And Andrew Scheer would rather cut taxes for big corporations and cut services Canadians count on. That’s what Conservatives do. “Liberals and Conservatives have shown they are in it for their rich friends, not for you,” added Singh. “New Democrats are different. We won’t just say the right things, we will actually do them. Canadians can count on us to fight for them.” ",2019-09-11

Adam Vaughan and the Liberals Paint a Pretty Picture of Their Housing Record While Experts Say “Not Much is Happening” As the Liberals gear up for an election, Justin Trudeau and his team are working hard to sell their bad housing record. In January, Liberal housing point person Adam Vaughan admitted that Trudeau’s claims on his record were inflated “to rhetorical advantage.” (Toronto Star)
And just a few weeks ago, Vaughan claimed a planned sale of the Queens Quay lands without affordable housing was out of government’s hands. The next week, the Liberals reversed course in the face of pressure from Jagmeet Singh and Councillor Joe Cressy. (Toronto Star)
In May, University of Toronto Professor David Hulchanski said that “the Liberal Party and even CMHC have mixed all these together into big sounding amounts, as if a great deal is happening. But not much is happening in terms of meeting housing need and existing spending on housing remains at a historically low percentage of the federal budget.” (Globe and Mail)
Professor Hulchanski also pointed out that “the lowest year for housing expenditures since the 1970s was 2016, when housing accounted only 0.7 per cent of the federal budget.” (Globe and Mail)
And this week, a report notes that the federal government is doing “little to help” growing challenges with homelessness. (Ottawa Citizen) But as Vaughan and Trudeau double count housing units to cover up their record, people are struggling. A recent report by Royal Lepage found the median price of condos in the GTA has risen 9% in the last year alone. (Toronto Star)
In Toronto and Vancouver, there are no neighbourhoods left where a person putting in full-time work for minimum wage can afford a modest one-bedroom apartment. (CCPA)
And the Canadian Rental Housing Index shows that one in five Canadians have to put more than half their paycheque into housing – leaving little for other necessities like food and medication. (Georgia Straight) Spadina—Fort York NDP Candidate Diana Yoon:  
		“Justin Trudeau and Adam Vaughan are giving us pretty words on housing, but they’ve given tax breaks to their rich friends instead of investing in the housing people need. Canadians deserve better.

Trudeau Refuses to Save New Brunswick’s Only Abortion Clinic Last week, New Brunswick’s only standalone abortion clinic announced that it is closing because of the province’s ongoing refusal to cover the cost of surgical abortion services outside of hospitals - a clear violation of the Canada Health Act. New Brunswick has violated the Canada Health Act every single day Justin Trudeau has been Prime Minister. And every single day, he has ignored widespread calls to use the powers of the act to ensure abortion is funded. This morning, Justin Trudeau was challenged by reporters on his failure to stand up for abortion access in Atlantic Canada. He promised to “sit down with Premier Higgs if re-elected.” He insisted “we had very clear conversations when I was leader and Prime Minister.” He bragged that “we encouraged Premier Gallant to expand access.” But every single day Justin Trudeau was Prime Minister, he chose not to use his powers to protect abortion access. Now, people in New Brunswick are losing access. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “Justin Trudeau says he stands up for choice, but he has consistently refused to use his power to protect access to abortion. If Justin Trudeau was serious about standing for the right to choose, he would have acted on this four years ago instead of just talking about it. We’ll enforce the law right away so we can save Clinic 554 and we’ll work to protect improve abortion access across Canada.” ",2019-10-15

TMX: Liberal Candidate Fought It, Trudeau Bought It Days before Justin Trudeau bought the Trans Mountain pipeline in 2018, his future candidate in Vancouver East called out the Liberals for forging ahead with the project despite “the absence of sound science.” Vancouver East Liberal Candidate and SFU Researcher Kyle Demes wrote: “Our research found large gaps in scientific understanding of the toxicity of diluted bitumen products to marine species and how the products will behave in the ocean.” “The gaps in knowledge, combined with incomplete risk assessment and insufficient baseline data, make it impossible to address the full suite of threats to ocean species and their habitats, or to assess the effectiveness of emergency actions, including spill response.” “In the absence of sound science, government has a duty to delay construction, and err on the side of coastal protection and climate progress.” (The Narwhal, May 24, 2018). Instead of listening to scientific advice from his future candidate, Trudeau bought the pipeline five days after the article was published. Trudeau also plowed over objections from his own MPs and the B.C. government. In 2014, Demes co-authored a study outlining significant scientific concerns, including the threat a spill poses to BC’s economy and human health.

Jagmeet Singh Lays Out Economic Vision to Help Young People and Families Singh delivers message on tax fairness and wealth inequality at Canadian Club TORONTO – Jagmeet Singh delivered a message on his economic vision to a lunchtime audience in Toronto today that if New Democrats are elected, people at the top will have to pay a little more. “We are not going to shy away from speaking up for everyday people – and standing up to the wealthy and well-connected,” said Singh. “The stakes are high. If we do not change the path we are on, we are putting the very idea of Canada – that everyone should get the help they need to have an equal chance to succeed - at risk.” In his speech before the 120-year-old Canadian Club, Singh made the case that despite the economy doing well over the past four years, families – and young people in particular – are struggling to pay their bills each month. Meanwhile, two Canadian men now have as much wealth as the bottom 30% of all Canadians combined. Over the last few decades, the tax burden in Canada has fallen more and more onto families - while big corporations and super-wealthy Canadians pay less. Earlier this week, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP laid out an election commitment to bring in a 1% super-wealth tax on households with a net wealth of more than $20 million. The Parliamentary Budget Office has estimated that this measure could bring in $70 billion in new revenue. “Young people are struggling to pay sky-high bills for rent, tuition, student loans, cell phones and so much more. It’s time we fixed a system that is rigged against them,” said Singh. ""We believe middle- and low-income Canadians are paying their fair share. We will not raise taxes on everyday people.

There are almost 40,000 fires are burning in the Amazon, and the state of Amazonas has declared an emergency.

Canada shouldn’t be doing business with Bolsonaro while the Amazon burns.” The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest, often called the “lungs of the planet” since it produces about 20 per cent of the world’s oxygen.

Instead of showing real leadership on serious issues Torontonians are facing, Trudeau was quick to blame Ontario Premier Doug Ford. Torontonians deserve a government that doesn't wait until a federal election campaign to talk about the issues they deal with every day - affordable housing, health care services, and safe cities.

""We must strike a new path, one that engages all communities in a united effort to tackle gun violence at its roots. We must replace simplistic solutions with comprehensive, well-informed strategies built out of partnership with those most affected."" In a press conference with the Prime Minister, Toronto Mayor John Tory drew attention to the lack of federal investment in kids, families, and neighbourhoods and explained how with the lack of federal resources, Toronto needs to do more to address violence over the long term. ""Mayor Tory is right to call attention to the lack of leadership from the federal government,"" said the NDP candidate for Davenport, Andrew Cash. ""I have been listening to people in Davenport and, yes, they worry about gun violence but they also worry about affordable housing, the cost of prescription drugs, and good quality jobs. It's not good enough for the Prime Minister to show up right before an election with no meaningful solutions after four years of inaction.

Here are 5 times Justin Trudeau tried cover his tracks: 
Blocking testimony at the Justice Committee. After the NDP called for an investigation at the Justice Committee into Justin Trudeau’s alleged political interference in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, the Liberals voted against a motion to investigate. They voted instead for their own, weaker motion – but they couldn’t stop former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould’s explosive testimony. After that, they shut the investigation down.
 
The NDP’s call for a Public Inquiry. After the Liberals axed the Justice Committee, the NDP called for a vote on a public inquiry in the House of Commons. In a close vote that saw some Liberals break ranks, they voted it down.
 
Blocking the Ethics Commissioner’s investigation. While the Ethics Commissioner was investigating (at the request of the NDP), the Liberals refused to give documents and critical testimony protected by refusing to waive Cabinet confidentiality. The Commissioner noted in his final report that he felt his investigation was blocked.
 
Blocking the Ethics Commissioner’s public testimony. After the Commissioner released his stinging report, NDP MPs pushed to hear directly from him at the Ethics Committee.

Singh Promises Immediate Relief for Students OTTAWA – Jagmeet Singh and the New Democrats have announced a plan to cancel the interest on all existing and future student loans. “Young people, just starting out, deserve a shot to get ahead and build their best life. We need to make sure that cost is never a barrier to education, and we can give those who recently left school relief from the struggle to make ends meet,” said Singh. “It’s wrong for the government to be profiting off the backs of students and grads. That’s why I will eliminate all interest on federal student loans — both outstanding loans, and going forward.” Over the last four years, Trudeau’s Liberals have taken almost $3 billion from graduates in interest payments – profiting from skyrocketing student debt. “Young people deserve to graduate with hope for a better future, not a crushing debt load,” said Singh. “They shouldn’t have to live with their parents because of student debt. They shouldn’t be trapped working hard and not getting by. And they shouldn’t have to put off starting their own family because of student debt. But that’s what’s happening now. “Eliminating the interest on student loans is a simple first step to make it easier to build a good life, and I’m looking forward to talking about more of our plans in the weeks to come.” Singh was joined by Andrew Cash, NDP candidate for Davenport, at a roundtable with young people to discuss the challenges faced by new graduates.

Study Shows How Trudeau’s Abandoned Pharmacare Promise Will Hurt People A study done by the St. Michael’s Hospital’s MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions shows that providing universal pharmacare will make life significantly more affordable for people. It found that covering the cost of prescription drugs causes a large increase – from 33% to 86% – in people’s ability to ""make ends meet"" or afford basic necessities such as food and rent, showing that for many people, medicine costs are the difference between paying the bills or not. Meanwhile, experts agree that Justin Trudeau has abandoned his pharmacare promise. Former Liberal Health Minister Jane Philpott says it falls “far short” of what is required. It’s been 22 years since the Liberals first rolled out their pharmacare promise. And this campaign, just six days after telling Canadians he would bring in pharmacare, Justin Trudeau completely abandoned Canadians struggling with the cost of prescription drugs. The lead scientists criticized the Liberals, pointing out that if they had made any progress on pharmacare in the last four years, they wouldn’t have been able to find people to participate in their study. NDP candidate Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway):

It doesn’t have to be this way. Trudeau’s Liberals could have chosen to stand up for Canadians and bring in drug coverage, but they listened to lobbyists and chose not to act.

NDP Will Tax Multimillionaires to Fund Health Care HAMILTON – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is meeting with Canadians struggling with cuts to important services they rely on and the growing cost of health care expenses. Singh is proposing a tax on those with fortunes above $20 million to make sure hardworking Canadians get the services they need like pharmacare and head-to-toe health care. “New Democrats have the courage to make different choices. Unlike the Liberals and Conservatives who work for their rich and powerful friends, we will help people who are struggling to get by,” said Singh. “Our plan is simple – we can afford to help people when we have the courage to ask the super-rich to pay a little bit more to fund the services we all rely on.” For years, Liberals and Conservatives have been helping their corporate friends and the very richest to avoid taxes and hide billions offshore every year. New Democrats will bring in a tax on the multimillionaires alongside tougher enforcement to stop tax evasion both in Canada, and off-shore. “Families shouldn’t have to worry about their future. They deserve a government that is actually on their side. Canadians deserve prescription drugs covered by Medicare, and expanded health care services to cover people head-to-toe – and we can do this when the very richest pay their fair share,” concluded Singh. – 30 – Facts: The NDP’s super-wealth tax would apply a 1% tax on fortunes above $20 million.
This will be applied annually and include real estate, luxury items and investments.
This tax will apply to only the very wealthiest one tenth of one percent of Canadian households.
Over ten years, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates that this tax will raise almost $70 billion, starting with $5.6 billion in 2020-21 and growing to $9.5 billion by 2028-29.
It will be paired with boosted enforcement against tax evasion and penalties for millionaires who try to evade paying taxes, including regular CRA audits and third-party valuation of assets.
In June 2019, the Parliamentary Budget Officer found that Canada is losing up to $25 billion in tax revenues to overseas tax evasion by multinational corporations. ",2019-09-10

Singh Challenges Trudeau on Super-Wealth Tax This morning, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called out Justin Trudeau for rejecting a wealth tax on multimillionaires with fortunes over $20 million: “We know that Mr. Trudeau is not willing to tax the richest Canadians. We put it to him, and people have asked him, would he be willing to put in place our wealth tax on the super wealthy? He hasn’t said yes. “No other party is willing to say we’re going to make sure that the richest Canadians, those who have fortunes of over $20 million, pay their fair share. Everyone else, Canadians, hardworking families, middle-class families, they’re paying their fair share. They don’t need to pay any more of the burden. “We’re not going to raise taxes on middle-class and working-class families. But we’re asking the richest to pay their fair share. Mr. Trudeau is not willing to do that.” After Trudeau was dubbed “Robin Hood” in the last election, his 2019 platform lets the top 1% completely off the hook while offering nothing for Canadians struggling with rising costs like housing and prescription drugs. Canada’s 87 richest families hold as much wealth as 12 million Canadians. Singh has made implementing a super-wealth tax on fortunes over $20 million an urgent priority in the next Parliament. The PBO estimates it will raise $5.6 billion in its first year to spend on priorities like pharmacare and dental care. ",2019-10-15

Liberal Platform Fails On Child Care NDP commits to 500,000 more affordable spaces VANCOUVER – Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh committed to delivering universal child care by 2030 and underscored the broken promises by Justin Trudeau’s Liberals that have failed everyday families. “Yesterday we saw more empty Liberal promises. Justin Trudeau is walking away from families who urgently need help and telling them they need to settle for less,” said Singh. “Four years after Justin Trudeau promised high-quality affordable child care for ‘all families that need it’ – there aren’t any child care spaces for three quarters of kids under six. This is wrong.” A New Democrat government will establish a universal child care and early learning system by 2030, beginning with a $10 billion investment over four years to create more than 500,000 new licensed child care spaces in partnership with provinces, territories and Indigenous governments. Parents in British Columbia have called the provincial NDP government’s $10 a day child care pilot program ‘life changing’. Our commitment will build on this success. The NDP will bring in legislation to enshrine our commitment to quality, affordable publicly funded child care, to set up a national child care secretariat to oversee the coordination of the work, and to collaborate with the provinces and territories on initiatives such as a workforce strategy and improved data sharing and research. “Liberals promised child care twenty-six years ago. The children who were born the year the Liberals first promised a national child care plan are now looking for child care for their own kids!"" said Singh. ""You can’t be a feminist if you fail to deliver on child care – period. New Democrats will fight for affordable child care for families."" The pledge is part of the NDP’s New Deal for Peoplethat makes life better, with affordable homes, universal prescription drug coverage and dental insurance to give immediate help to Canadian families.

Trudeau Stalling Pharmacare, Again Petitpas Taylor's announcement comes after the Liberals met with pharma and insurance companies more than 700 times NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh released the following statement in response to the Health Minister Ginette Petipas Taylor’s announcement that the Liberal government would tweak a drug price comparator list, rather than move ahead with a universal plan to cover Canadians’ prescription drugs: “The Liberals have announced another stall tactic to avoid pharmacare — a stall tactic that is yet another favour to the richest drug companies, at the expense of Canadians. The best way Canada can lower the price of drugs is well documented: buying them in bulk using the negotiating power of a 37-million-person single-payer pharmacare plan. But big pharmaceutical and insurance companies don’t want that, so after meeting with them more than 700 times since 2015, Trudeau’s Liberals are stalling pharmacare, and therefore making life easier for big pharma. And while Trudeau stalls, millions of people are skipping the medicine they need because of the cost. Far too often, they end up in the emergency department. The NDP is leading the fight to expand medicare to include prescription drug coverage for everyone, regardless of their job status, where they live, their age, their health status, or how much money they make. With our New Deal for People, by late 2020, Canadians will only need their health card – not their credit card – to buy the medicine their family needs, saving each household more than $500 a year.” ",2019-08-09

As Trudeau Campaigns on Abortion, Millions of Canadians Still Face Barriers Accessing It While Justin Trudeau styles himself a defender of abortion rights, his record tells a very different story. People in rural communities across Canada are often forced to travel hundreds of kilometers to access an abortion, while some provinces continue to openly obstruct access. In New Brunswick, abortion services are only covered if performed in a hospital.  Those seeking abortions from private clinics pay up to $850 out of pocket. Many communities have no abortion clinic nearby. In Nova Scotia, barriers to access can sometimes mean travelling over 500 km to a hospital that will provide the procedure. In PEI, abortions only became available in 2016, and there is still only one clinic that provides them. Earlier this year, the Leader of the PEI Liberals attended an anti-choice rally. But the Liberals have refused to impose real consequences if provinces make it hard to access abortion. New Democrats will make sure that abortion services are safe and accessible no matter where you live by enforcing the Canada Health Act, and stepping in to fund abortion services when provinces refuse to do so. The NDP will also bring in a universal pharmacare program that will cover prescription contraceptives at no cost. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “No Canadian should struggle to access the essential health care services they need. Despite what Justin Trudeau is saying about choice, he has refused to stand up for the millions of Canadians who still can’t access a safe and legal abortion. Once again, he’s telling Canadians one thing and doing the opposite. We’ll always defend the right to choose and work to make sure that a full range of reproductive health services are available to all who need them."" ",2019-09-23

From Brampton to Nunavut, Singh Encourages People to Get to the Polls BRAMPTON – With momentum on Jagmeet Singh’s side, the NDP Leader will spend Saturday meeting with people in Brampton and Toronto, and having coffee via Facebook Live with Mumilaaq Qaqqaq, the NDP candidate in Nunavut, while encouraging people to vote in the advance polls. “It’s hard for working families to get ahead when the Liberals keep giving breaks to the richest corporations, and forcing the rest of us to pay the price,” said Singh. “Over the last four years, Justin Trudeau had no problem finding billions of dollars in tax giveaways for his corporate friends – but he left Canadians waiting for help on drug costs, child care and finding an affordable place to call home. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can make better choices.” Liberals and Conservatives have been asking families to work harder, dip into their savings or take on debt just for necessities like a place to call home, cell phone bills, medication, and dentist appointments. Meanwhile, profitable corporations and the super-wealthy have done very well over the last four years. “Like Liberals do every election, Justin Trudeau is trying to scare Canadians into settling for less – but New Democrats know that you deserve better,” added Singh. “Families are struggling, and they need help now. We’ve got a bold plan to make life more affordable, strengthen health care and confront the climate crisis. New Democrats will fight for you. We choose you.” The NDP’s New Deal for People will create 500,000 affordable child care spaces within four years, launch a universal pharmacare program, bring in no-cost dental coverage for working families who need it, expand affordable housing and give struggling families immediate help with rent, and lift the burden of student debt by cancelling all federal loan interest.

NDP Promises Families Relief on Cell Phone and Internet Bills NDP’s plan to cap prices would save Canadian families almost $250 per year TORONTO –  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in Toronto today to announce his plan to protect Canadians from gouging by big telecom companies. Singh is calling for a cap on cell phone and internet prices, which would save families almost $250 a year. “For most Canadians, having a cell phone and high-speed Internet is not a choice — they need these things for school, for work, and to stay connected with family and friends,” said Singh. “And Canadians who are fortunate to have access to reliable service pay some of the highest prices in the developed world. They can’t afford to give these things up, even as rising costs squeeze their budgets.” Liberal and Conservative governments have left Canadians to go at it alone as telecom companies gouge them all while raking in billions of dollars. On Trudeau’s watch, the Big Five telecoms enjoyed profit margins of almost 40 per cent in 2017. To top it off, Trudeau rewarded Bell, Rogers and Telus with $50 million in subsidies and more than $700 million in contracts. “Canadians deserve better than Liberal and Conservative governments that keep making life easier for their corporate friends and harder for everyone else,” said Singh. “I’m ready to fight for everyday people and stand up to rich telecom companies. Our plan to cap prices on cell phone and internet bills is part of our commitment to make life more affordable.” The New Deal for People would also introduce a Telecom Consumers’ Bill of Rights to put an end to the aggressive and misleading sales and services practices of big cell and internet companies. The NDP will require service providers to offer basic plans that meet the needs of Canadians, end caps for internet plans and require companies to offer affordable, unlimited data plans for cellphones – so Canadians don’t have any surprise on their monthly bills. Facts: Among OECD countries and other developed economies, Canadians pay some of the highest prices for mobile wireless and broadband subscriptions.
Similar countries like Australia are sometimes paying 2 times less than Canada for the same plan.
In 2018, the total revenue per gigabyte in Canada was roughly 70 times higher than in India and 23 times higher than in Finland.
Canadian telecoms made 35 times what Indian companies made for the same data usage in 2017. As a result, Canada has lower data use than many other countries.
The NDP price cap will save families on average $10 per month for each bill meaning that a family with two plans will save almost $250 per year. ",2019-09-13

The Minister of Sport, Kirsty Duncan, claimed last month that her department had rolled out a series of initiatives, but to date her government has only allocated $69 000 for unspecified ‘’safe sport initiatives’’. The Liberals are not taking this problem seriously. This is about the safety of children. We still don’t have an independent investigative unit responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-harassment policy and for complaints of abuse and harassment in sport. The Liberals have also failed to inform organizations representing Canada’s largest participatory sports about the existence of a tip line for athletes and witnesses to call if they experience abuse.

NDP’s New Deal For B.C. Highlights Affordable Homes, Climate Action Jagmeet Singh takes on money launderers and housing speculation VANCOUVER—More affordable homes and a real plan to fight the climate crisis are at the heart of a New Deal for B.C. unveiled today by NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “When B.C. families asked for help with the out-of-control housing market, Justin Trudeau spent $4.5 billion of their money on a pipeline instead,” said Singh. “Liberals and Conservatives have failed people here for too long. British Columbians deserve a real partner in Ottawa: a New Democrat government that has the courage to do what’s right to make sure that everyone has an affordable place to call home.” While the B.C. government has done the hard work to tackle the housing crisis, Trudeau has failed to do enough on the money laundering and speculation that’s driving up real estate prices. The NDP’s urgent action plan includes a dedicated RCMP unit to fight money laundering and a national registry that prevents companies from hiding who profits from real estate, along with a tax on foreign buyers to address housing speculation. “New Democrats understand the priorities of British Columbians, and we will fight for them,” said Singh. “Working families have paid the price long enough for the pretty words and empty promises. We’ll take real action to make housing more affordable, because we’re in it for you.” The NDP’s plan to make life more affordable for B.C. families includes bringing down the cost of cell phone bills, and bringing in dental care and universal prescription drug coverage. New Democrats will also fight the climate crisis with a bold plan to defend our land, water and coasts, while creating good-paying jobs that families can rely on. – 30 – Facts: In April 2019, B.C.’s expert panel reported that money laundering funded $5.3 billion in real estate purchases and was responsible for increasing housing prices by 5% across the province. [1]
The report found that B.C. didn’t have a single federal RCMP officer dedicated to investigating money laundering.
Currently, it would take the average young person 29 years to save enough money for a down payment on a home in Vancouver. [2]
The NDP’s plan will immediately create a dedicated RCMP anti-money laundering unit – with B.C. as a priority. We will invest $20 million in additional funding each year, half of which will go to B.C., to ensure that dedicated officers work on money laundering.
Building on the leadership of the B.C. government, we would require corporations, trusts and partnerships that currently own or buy land to disclose who owns them by creating a national beneficial ownership registry. Tax authorities, police, and regulators would be able to use the information to crack down on tax evasion, fraud, and money laundering.
We will also bring in a national foreign buyer’s tax to curb speculation that’s fueling high housing prices. The 15% Foreign Buyer’s Tax will apply on the sale of homes to individuals who aren’t Canadian citizens or permanent residents, on top of existing provincial taxes. This will raise an estimated $320 million in the first full year of implementation. ",2019-09-25

Justin Trudeau’s Tax Avoidance Hypocrisy This morning, Justin Trudeau attacked Andrew Scheer for planning a tax break for people who use numbered companies to protect their income. Trudeau said Scheer is “planning to give a tax break, larger than the average person makes in a year, for people who are using private corporations to hide, to protect their income.” Meanwhile, he’s refusing to crack down on multimillionaires using offshore tax havens to avoid Canadian taxes. In June, the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that Canada was losing up to $25 billion in revenue every year because corporations were doing business in Canada then transferring money to known tax havens to be taxed at a lower rate. $25 billion represents $675 in lost revenue for every Canadian. Two years ago, the Paradise Papers revealed that Justin Trudeau’s close friend and chief fundraiser Stephen Bronfman was linked to a $60 million offshore trust in the Cayman Islands which may have cost Canada millions in lost revenue. Former Liberal Prime Ministers Jean Chretien and Paul Martin were also linked to offshore tax havens. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: “If Justin Trudeau meant a word he said, he’d be taking action to crack down on tax havens. Instead, he’s chosen to protect wealthy Liberal insiders and make Canadians pay the price.
