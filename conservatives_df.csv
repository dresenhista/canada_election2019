Scheer to restore order, fairness, and compassion to Canada’s immigration system
A new Conservative government will restore
public confidence in Canada’s immigration system by stopping the flow of
illegal border crossers from the United States and prioritizing newcomers from
the world’s most dangerous countries, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said.
“Canadians’ confidence in the immigration system has been
rocked by Justin Trudeau’s chaos and mismanagement,” Scheer said. “When
everybody follows the rules and the laws are enforced, immigration is good for
the economy, good for jobs, and good for the people who have chosen to come to
Canada.
As Prime Minister, I will take steps to restore confidence
in the system and make sure Canada’s immigration system prioritizes those who
need Canada’s help the most.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will:
Prioritize funding to support immigration services like language training, credential recognition, as      well as services specifically designed for vulnerable newcomers like women, girls, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.Prioritize those who apply to come to Canada through the appropriate immigration streams, especially in the family reunification program.Close the loophole in the Safe Third Country Agreement.Move existing Immigration and Refugee Board judges to common illegal border crossing points, speeding up the process and therefore making it less attractive to enter Canada illegally.Hire an additional 250 CBSA enforcement officers.Listen carefully to provinces on immigration issues, with an aim to work closely to best accommodate their needs and priorities. A Conservative government would be ready to negotiate with the Government of Quebec to discuss the selection of those who wish to settle in Quebec.  We will be open to requests to amend the Canada-Quebec Accord on Immigration.
“These measures will restore fairness and compassion to
our immigration system while providing stronger enforcement of the law at the
border,” said Scheer. “If these measures aren’t taken, confidence in
immigration will continue to slide and legitimate refugees will wait longer and
longer for Canada’s help.”
FACTS:
In 2017, Justin Trudeau created an illegal border crossing crisis in Canada with his #WelcomeToCanada tweet, resulting in more than 50,000 illegal border crossers entering Canada and      costing taxpayers $1.6 billion.A poll in August 2018 found that 65% of Canadians believed the massive influx of illegal border crossers      was a “crisis.”Justin Trudeau has compensated Roxham Road residents $400,000 of taxpayer money for “disruptions” from those crossing the border illegally.Canada is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law, and fundamental and universal human rights, and these values must be reflected in our immigration system.Only a Conservative government will restore compassion and fairness to Canada’s immigration system while protecting and securing our borders.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your      family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax      Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income      Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50%, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians      for green home improvements.

Ottawa,
Ontario – Yesterday, as part of the Liberal platform, Justin Trudeau announced
an expansion of the Child Disability Tax Credit. 
But
the last time Justin Trudeau needed money for his out-of-control deficit
spending he targeted Canadians living with disabilities to pay the bill.
In
2016 Justin Trudeau ordered the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to crack down on
“tax cheats”. As a result, the CRA started clawing back disability benefits –
cutting off diabetics, children with Autism, and a number of other Canadians
living with chronic conditions. 
The result was endless hardship for Canadians
living with disabilities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“As Jewish communities in Canada and around the world prepare to mark Rosh Hashanah and the beginning of the High Holy Days, tonight’s sunset brings with it the Jewish New Year. 

“Rosh Hashanah is celebrated on the first two days of the month of Tishrei and commemorates the day the universe was created by God. Following the sounding of the shofar – the ram’s horn – Jewish community members will recite blessings and light candles.  

“As friends and families share meals with sweet challah and apple slices dipped in honey, they will reflect on renewal, and hope for an abundant year ahead. 

“Canada has truly been blessed by the strong presence of the Canadian Jewish community which continue to add to our country’s culture and values of pluralism and freedom. This Rosh Hashanah, we recommit ourselves to combat all forms of antisemitism and to work together to better our country.

“On behalf of the Canada’s Conservatives, I extend my best wishes to the Jewish community, across Canada and around the world, celebrating Rosh Hashanah.

Families will start saving hundreds of dollars per year for coldest winter months
As part of its 100 Day Action Plan, a new
Conservative government will repeal Justin Trudeau’s carbon tax as its first
piece of legislation, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said today. 
Scheer has already announced that he will convene
Parliament, at which time he will introduce and pass the Carbon
Tax Repeal Act so Canadians aren’t stuck paying a carbon tax over
another long, cold winter.
“Canadians cannot afford to be punished every time they
drive their kids to school or turn up their thermostat on a cold winter day,”
Scheer said. “That’s why a new Conservative government will make sure Trudeau’s
carbon tax is history by January 1 and we will use every legislative tool at
our disposal to get it done.”
Trudeau’s Environment Minister Catherine McKenna has
already confirmed that the carbon tax will go up if the Liberals are
re-elected, but hasn’t said by how much. With Trudeau and the NDP now scheming
to form a coalition government, Scheer said the carbon tax will go through the
roof.
“A government with Trudeau as the spokesman and the NDP
calling the shots would be the worst possible outcome for Canadians,” Scheer
said. “Part of the NDP’s price to keep Trudeau in power will be a massive
increase to the carbon tax. It’s the coalition Canadians can’t afford.”
Scheer also highlighted another part of his 100 Day Action
Plan: removing the GST from Canadians’ home heating bills.
“In Canada, heating your home is not a luxury, it’s a
necessity,” Scheer said.  “Rising home energy costs are a particular
burden on low and middle class families. Justin Trudeau believes we should tax
these families for the privilege of heating their homes. I disagree. I will
take the GST off home heating in my first 100 days as Prime Minister.”
Scheer highlighted how families in Ontario will save as a
result of these measures.  Repealing the Trudeau Carbon Tax will save the
average Ontario family $244 per year, while
removing the GST on home energy costs will save them
$114 more.  
ANDREW SCHEER’S FIRST 100 DAY ACTION PLAN
Introduce
‘Get Ahead Fiscal Update’ within 45 of days of taking office.Implement
Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, Children’s Fitness Tax Credit,Children’s
Arts and Learning Tax Credit and Green Public Transit Tax Credit by January 1,

Trudeau’s plan means less coverage and higher prices for you
Justin Trudeau today left the door wide open to
banning employer drug coverage if he’s re-elected on October 21.
When asked by journalists if his pharmacare
plan would replace current employee drug plans with a government-imposed plan,
Trudeau refused to answer. 
In fact, the report Trudeau based this
announcement on recommended an end to employee drug benefits. 
Today’s announcement is a desperate attempt by
Justin Trudeau to distract from his scandals. 
Trudeau’s Liberals promised pharmacare in 1997
and 2004. They broke their promise then and Justin Trudeau will do it again.
Trudeau cannot be trusted and he is not as advertised.
The proof that he plans to break his promise is
found in the fact that Trudeau is only offering a fraction of the funding
needed to achieve universal pharmacare coverage.  
To pay for his massive deficits, Justin Trudeau
will cut health care funding or raise taxes on middle-class families. Liberal
cuts are exactly what happened in the 1990s, cuts Trudeau said he supported. 
Only Andrew Scheer and the Conservative Party
can be trusted to maintain and increase health care spending by 3% per year.
Under a new Conservative government, Canadians will be able to count on stable
and predictable health and social program funding.

A new Conservative government would engage new strategies, partnerships
and provide funding to support critical industry
Alfie MacLeod, Conservative Candidate for Cape Breton
– Canso, and Eddie Orrell, Conservative Candidate for Sydney – Victoria, were
in Glace Bay today to speak with local fish harvesters about Andrew Scheer’s
plan to promote and support Canada’s fisheries by adopting new strategies and
partnerships to strengthen relationships and build consensus on how to restore
fish stocks. Similar announcements were made by Conservative candidates across
the country.
“The Trudeau Liberals have failed to consult fish
harvesters over the past four years and this has had a real impact on our
coastal communities,” said Alfie MacLeod. “Livelihoods throughout our
province depend on the fishery. 
Conservatives will work with Nova Scotians to strengthen this vital
resource.”
To renew engagement and consultation to support our
fisheries, a new Conservative government will:
Create advisory panels with fish harvesters and anglers, Indigenous groups, and other experts
as appropriate, to rebuild critical stocks and ensure that everyone is working
together. Enhance and rebuild wild Atlantic and Pacific salmon stocks by increasing support for community-led conservation and enhancement
projects and increasing the price of the Salmon Conservation Stamp for
non-residents to benefit the Pacific Salmon Foundation.Complete new recovery
plans for all of Canada’s critical fisheries and develop strategies for managing
predators and invasive species where necessary.Repeal measures that
bypass community consultations for Marine Protected Areas while ensuring that the process is robust and timely. Justin Trudeau’s changes have short
circuited important community consultations for Marine Protected Areas. Work with industry to
develop a strategy for preventing seafood fraud.Create a modern
aquaculture act.Support the advancement
of technology and practices that reduce contact between wild and farmed salmon.
“It is so important to note the important role that
fisheries play in our local economies,” said Alfie MacLeod. “To maintain
infrastructure and support communities, a new Conservative government will provide $250 million in additional support for small craft harbours.”
Supporting our fisheries is also an important part of A
Real Plan to Protect Our Environment. As part of our
efforts to combat oceans plastic, a new Conservative government will work with
international partners to reduce the prevalence of “ghost gear”, or abandoned
and lost gear, which entangles marine wildlife and contributes to the world’s
oceans’ plastic problem. We will work to protect our oceans against one of the
deadliest forms of marine litter.
“A new Conservative government will support our fishing
industry to ensure our local communities and economies continue to thrive,”
said Eddie Orrell. “These are necessary measures – strategies, partnerships,
and funding – to make sure this critical industry continues to thrive.”
Andrew
Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives: “Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.
This election, Canadians have a choice. Between the poor judgement of Justin
Trudeau, and a new, positive Conservative government that will take immediate
action to give you more help at home.”

Conservatives plan to increase health care transfers to the provinces by at least 3% per year
When it comes to improving Canada’s health

Under a Conservative government, funding for health care
will increase by at least 3% every single year, and we will maintain additional

We will make major investments in new medical equipment

to the treatments that they need.
Unfortunately Canadians cannot trust Justin Trudeau. The
media have already reported that Justin Trudeau’s health care promises won’t fill the

deficits will force him to cut health care spending. In fact, in the 1990s,

spending by nearly 40%, cuts Trudeau said he

New transnational project to generate economic and social benefits across the country
A new Conservative government will create a national corridor to carry Canadian energy and resources from coast to coast, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“It’s time for a government that understands we’re in this together,
that Canada works better when we work together,” Scheer said. “A new National
Energy Corridor will create jobs and opportunities while uniting Canadians in
our shared potential and prosperity.” 
A National Energy Corridor will generate
economic and social benefits for the entire country by moving oil, gas,
hydroelectricity, telecommunications, and potentially accommodating other
linear infrastructure. With a single corridor, industry wouldn’t need to submit
complicated proposals for every new project.
A single coast-to-coast corridor would:
minimize environmental impactslower the costs of environmental assessments without sacrificing qualityincrease certainty for investorsget critical projects builtand create good-paying jobs. 
A new Conservative government will appoint a
blue-ribbon task force to provide recommendations within six months of its
establishment on how to proceed. The government would then begin to work with the
provinces and Indigenous peoples – who would both share in the prosperity this
project would provide – to realize this vital coast-to-coast link. 
“As
Canadians, we need to start dreaming big again, and we need to start dreaming
together,” said Scheer. “We need to start building a stronger, more united
country worthy of those who came before us and that our children and

New conservative government to extend EI parental leave to parents in mourning
A new Conservative government will ensure
that EI parental leave is extended for eight weeks following the death of a
baby, affording parents experiencing unimaginable tragedy a much-needed
opportunity to begin coping with their loss.
“With this policy, we hope to give grieving parents some
much-needed support during a time of unimaginable loss,” said Blake Richards,
Conservative Candidate for Banff-Airdrie. “The government can, and must, do
more to support Canadians undergoing such trying times.”
The loss of a child is a situation no parents should ever
have to face. Unfortunately, so many Canadians across the country are put in
this terrible situation and parents are sometimes forced to return to work with
no opportunity to begin to address the profound and recent tragedy that
confronts them.
Currently, EI parental benefits end abruptly the week
following the loss of a child, which comes as a shock to many. A parent’s
sadness should not be compounded by financial worry, and these parents should
not have to worry about their bottom line. Extending EI parental benefits is
the least a government can do.
“There is nothing that can prepare a parent for this experience. We hope that by offering more time, parents will have the important opportunity to cope, to seek help, and to be comforted by those around then,” said Richards. “My deepest sympathies go out to parents who have struggled with the loss of a child. I am proud that a new Conservative government will do more to provide support and relief to Canadians experiencing such difficult times in their lives.”
Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives – “The death of a child, at any age is a painful experience – and the loss of a child is followed by the most intense grief. By extending EI benefits to grieving parents, a Conservative government will provide some relief to mourning parents.”

New Military Covenant will clear backlog for Veterans’ benefits within 24 months
Canadian Veterans struggling with months-long waits
for pensions and benefits can count on a new Conservative government to take
immediate action to get them the support they deserve.
Andrew Scheer, leader of Canada’s Conservatives,
announced a comprehensive plan today to deliver more help to Canada’s Veterans
in a timely and respectful manner.
“To every Veteran who has struggled and who
continues to struggle without the support and benefits you have earned through
your service, my message is this: You deserve better. After October 21, we are
going to make things better,” Scheer said. “Instead of forcing Veterans to work
harder for government benefits, it’s time the government worked harder for our Veterans’
benefit. It’s time for a government that works harder for you; it’s time for
you to get ahead.”
Scheer highlighted that a new Conservative
government will:
Enshrine, in legislation, a Military Covenant between the Government of
Canada and all Canada’s Veterans. This will guarantee that every Veteran is
treated with respect and is provided services in a timely manner.Clear the current backlog of Veterans’ benefit applications within 24
months.Create a reliable, dependable pension system that, unlike the Liberal
status quo, is fair to Canada’s most disabled Veterans.Strengthen transition services to support discharged or retired Canadian
Armed Forces members.Strike an independent inquiry to provide answers about Canadian Armed
Forces members who were administered mefloquine.Provide more service dogs to Canadian Veterans in their communities.Put vital
commemoration projects, like the National Memorial for Canada’s War in
Afghanistan, back on track.
“These actions are simple, straightforward, and
practical,” said Scheer. “They require new investment from a new government, but
even more importantly, they require new priorities.  Our military heroes are deserving. Our
military heroes are worth it.”
In 2015, Justin Trudeau promised that no Veteran
would have to “fight the government for the support and compensation they have
earned.”  Yet under the Trudeau Liberals
the number of Veterans left stranded on government waitlists had ballooned to
40,000 – a growth of over 33 per cent. Worst of all, Trudeau continues to fight
Veterans in court, and has dismissed their concerns saying, “They’re asking for
more than we are able to give.”
“Justin Trudeau never turned back SNC-Lavalin’s
lobbyists or claimed they were ‘asking for more than he was able give’,” said Scheer.
“When corporate lobbyists get the red carpet while Veterans get left out in the
cold, it’s proof that Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.”
“To our Veterans, whether you are among the
vanishing generations of heroes who served in 
World War II and the Korean War, or whether you are one of the heroes of
Afghanistan or conflict zones around the world, you deserve our gratitude,”
said Scheer.  
“When we look out for our Veterans, we are looking
out for the people who dedicated their lives to looking out for us. It’s time
for government that will stand up for our Veterans. It’s time for a
Conservative government that will help you get ahead.”

Justin Trudeau is lying and misrepresenting the Conservative plan to support infrastructure projects across Canada. Let’s look at the facts. Public policy expert Jack Mintz confirmed that the Conservative plan only “delays” infrastructure spending by three years. He also confirmed that these delays only impact “uncommitted infrastructure spending”.  In contrast, the Liberals cut up to 40% of infrastructure spending from 2016-2017.  The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) agrees. The PBO confirms that the Conservative plan will extend “spending for the Investing in Canada Plan (ICP) over an eleven-year period, rather than the eight-year period.” The PBO also says that the Conservative plan would “spread the same nominal amount of money over a longer period of time”. The PBO also confirmed that our plan continues “funding obligations already committed to by the Government”.  Justin Trudeau is lying to Canadians. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives will maintain infrastructure spending. Instead we will cut corporate welfare and foreign aid to relatively wealthy countries in order to lower taxes and help you get ahead. https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/ElectionProposalCosting/Results/33020559_EN.pdf?timestamp=1570992945242 https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/Reports/2019/Main_estimates_2019_20/The%20Government%E2%80%99s%20Expenditure%20Plan%20and%20Main%20Estimates%20for%202019-20_EN.pdf.pdf

Trudeau is campaigning with two planes, emitting more than double the amount of other campaigns
Despite marching in climate strikes,
lecturing everybody else on lowering emissions, and imposing a carbon tax on
hard-working Canadians, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are secretly using two
aircraft to campaign in this election.
Conservatives have confirmed that Trudeau’s official
Boeing 737-800 campaign planes (his official branded plane and two
replacements) have been travelling with a second aircraft – a 40-year-old
Boeing 737-200 with tail number C-GNLE.
His official branded plane – tail number C-GTQB – and the second plane were spotted on the tarmac together at Pearson Airport in Toronto yesterday:



Flight records show his three official planes have been accompanied by the second plane throughout the campaign:

Not only is Trudeau running with two
aircraft, his second plane is by far the highest-emitting aircraft in the
campaign. The Boeing 737-200 burns through a staggering 975 gallons of jet fuel
an hour. His official branded plane burns between 800
and 850 gallons an hour.
By comparison, Jagmeet Singh’s NDP plane burns 795 gallons an hour and
Andrew Scheer’s Conservative plane burns 640
gallons an hour.
That means Trudeau’s campaign is emitting nearly three times as
much as the Conservative campaign.
“Canadians are tired of being lectured to and taxed by a
high-carbon hypocrite like Justin Trudeau,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
said. “As usual, there’s one set of rules for him, and one set of rules for the
rest of us. He is simply not as advertised.”

Minister he will appoint Kevin Falcon, the former deputy premier and finance
minister of British Columbia, and Yves Desjardins-Siciliano, the former
president and CEO of VIA Rail Canada, to lead the Commission on
the Reduction of Government Subsidy Programs to Corporations. This is the first
announcement of Andrew Scheer’s 100 Day Action Plan – the steps a new
Conservative government would take to help Canadians get ahead. 
“You shouldn’t have to be a billionaire to get your
government’s attention,” Scheer said. “You deserve a government, and a Prime
Minister, whose first priority will be to help you get ahead.”
The Commission on
the Reduction of Government Subsidy Programs to Corporations will
review all business subsidy programs, including grants and contributions to
corporations. The commission’s mandate will include:
Reducing corporate subsidies by $1.5 billion
per yearRecommending performance metrics for corporate
subsidy programsReviewing innovation programs to ensure that
they are supporting Canadian companies that provide benefits, profits and
patents that stay in Canada.
The commission will be operated out of the Department
of Finance. A new Conservative government will also strengthen Canada’s regional development agencies, focusing on helping
small and medium businesses to grow.
“There is a truism I’ve
learned watching governments of all stripes throw taxpayer dollars at
undeserving corporations. Governments have a terrible record of picking between
winners and losers. I’m proud to have been part of a government that eliminated
all corporate subsidies, grants and equity investments to individual for-profit
businesses. I applaud the Conservative party and Andrew Scheer for their
commitment to scale back this corporate welfare and redirect it where it
belongs, in the pockets of Canadian families,” Falcon said. 
“As in
all areas of government, spending taxpayers’ money must be efficient and
produce the greatest benefits to Canada’s economy. I’m honoured to co-chair
this review with a distinguished Canadian, and I’m confident our review will
yield the expected benefits,” said Desjardins-Siciliano. 
“Hard-working
Canadians are rightly offended when they see their tax dollars going to further
the interests of the wealthy and well-connected friends, while Justin Trudeau
makes them pay more for gasoline, groceries, and home heating,” Scheer said.

Justin Trudeau failed to deliver the infrastructure he promised to Canadians
The independent Parliamentary Budget Officer
(PBO) confirmed that Justin Trudeau was unable to deliver 40% of the budgeted
infrastructure he promised.
In contrast Andrew Scheer will extend the Investing in
Canada Plan by an additional three years so that the entire $187-billion
program is spent over 15 years instead of 12.
Conservatives worked with the PBO to ensure that our
infrastructure plan:
Maintains all projects committed to by the Liberal Government;Maintains the Gas Tax Fund and Goods and Services Tax rebate to municipalities at the same levels; andFunds important projects such as: The George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project (British Columbia);The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension (Ontario); andThe third link between Quebec City and Levis (Québec).

Trudeau’s plan puts you further in debt while Andrew Scheer’s plan puts more money in your pocket
Today Justin Trudeau announced
interest-free loans for Canadians to renovate their homes. But Canadians who
are struggling to make-ends-meet can’t afford a loan to renovate their house
while Justin Trudeau continues to hike taxes and make life more unaffordable.
Justin Trudeau wants you to take on as much as
$40,000 in debt to make your home energy efficient, while Andrew Scheer has a
plan to put more money in your pocket, as much as $3,800. 
Trudeau’s green renovation plan will require you to
be audited by the government, not once but twice. Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives
won’t require the government to come to your house and tell you how to renovate
your home. 
Trudeau’s Liberals will even make you pay for one
of these audits. 
What’s worse, to pay for this loan program, Justin
Trudeau is going to use the money you paid the CHMC to help wealthy landlords
replace the windows and roofs on their investment properties. 
In fact, part of Trudeau’s plan only applies to the
very rich who can afford expensive homes.
Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have a plan a
better plan to help you get ahead by making Canadians eligible to receive a 20%
refundable credit on their income tax for green improvements to their homes of
over $1,000 and up to $20,000. This would allow Canadians to save up to $3,800
on their renovations each year.

Trudeau Liberals’ have put home ownership further out of reach for Canadians
Today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced that a new Conservative
government would introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time
homebuyers to buy a home.
“With his poor judgement and tax hikes, Justin Trudeau has put the
dream of home ownership further out of reach for so many, especially young
Canadians,” Scheer said. “As Prime Minister, I will fix his bad policies and
work to get more homes on the market to lower the price of housing.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will: 
Fix the mortgage stress test to ensure that first-time homebuyers aren’t unnecessarily prevented from accessing mortgages and work with OSFI to remove the stress test from mortgage renewals to give homeowners more options. Increase amortization periods on insured mortgages to 30 years for first-time homebuyers to lower monthly payments. Launch an inquiry into money laundering in the real estate sector and work with our industry partners to root out corrupt practices that inflate housing prices. Make surplus federal real estate available for development to increase the supply of housing. 
Canada’s
Conservatives know the government has an important role to play to put home
ownership within reach for more Canadians. When you work hard, save, and invest
in your future, the government should help you – not stand in your way. 
FACTS
New data shows the country’s youngest
buyers are affected most by the Trudeau Liberals’
stress test.Justin Trudeau’s latest homebuyer “incentive” has
so many terms and conditions that most first-time homebuyers don’t qualify.
What’s more, it only targets select cities.Right now, more than 80
per cent of middle-income families are paying $800 more in taxes a year than
they did in 2015. The cost of housing continues to skyrocket, and the carbon
tax means that everyday necessities like gas, groceries and heating your home
keep getting more and more expensive. It’s harder than ever before to save for
a down payment or monthly bills. Justin Trudeau has proven that he
can’t be trusted to help Canadians get ahead. If he’s given four more years,
his carbon tax will cost Canadians hundreds of dollars a year. Life is
expensive enough for Canadian families without Justin Trudeau costing them even
more.
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit, saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents. Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs. Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest-income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boosting the government’s matching RESP contributions by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids education. For some, that could be $540 more.

A new Conservative government would take measures to safeguard against abuse of power
In Justin Trudeau’s
riding of Papineau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today that a
new Conservative government would launch a judicial inquiry into the
SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.
A new Conservative government will also introduce the No More Cover-Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access information protected by cabinet confidence by making an application to the Supreme Court of Canada. This will prevent corrupt politicians from hiding behind cabinet confidence to escape police investigation. 
As confirmed by
hours of Parliamentary testimony, taped conversations, and an Ethics
Commissioner’s guilty verdict, Trudeau politically interfered in SNC-Lavalin’s
criminal prosecution by trying to “circumvent, undermine, and ultimately attempt
to discredit” former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould.
However, to
this day, Trudeau refuses to waive cabinet confidence, keeping important
details of the scandal secret and preventing several key witnesses, including
Ms. Wilson-Raybould, from disclosing evidence.
“Justin Trudeau
has covered up his role in the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal every step of the
way,” Scheer said. “He blocked three Parliamentary investigations, refused to
co-operate with the Ethics Commissioner, and is currently blocking the RCMP
from obtaining key evidence. As Prime Minister, I will call a judicial inquiry
so Canadians can finally get the answers they deserve.”
“No longer will
a corrupt Prime Minister be able to be the gatekeeper of his own misconduct,”
said Scheer. “These measures will safeguard our democracy against the whims of
sleazy and unscrupulous politicians. Justin Trudeau has so far avoided
consequence for the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal, but the Canadian people
will deliver their verdict on October 21.” 
FACTS: 
In
2017, Justin Trudeau became the first Prime Minister in Canadian history to be
found guilty of breaking ethics laws for accepting a vacation from a lobbyist.
In August, he was found guilty again for his role in the SNC-Lavalin corruption
scandal.Trudeau
abused the power of his office to shut down two separate Ethics Committee
investigations and a Justice Committee investigation.In
his final report, Trudeau II, Ethics
Commissioner Mario Dion noted, “During this examination, nine witnesses
informed our Office that they had information they believed to be relevant, but
that could not be disclosed because, according to them, this information would
reveal a confidence of the Queen’s Privy Council and would fall outside the
scope of Order in Council 2019-0105.”Right
before the election, Canadians learned the RCMP is being prevented from
investigating possible obstruction of justice because Trudeau refuses to waive
cabinet confidence.

Trudeau’s candidate continues to support individual with known antisemitic views

















According to B’nai
Brith Canada, Justin Trudeau’s candidate Iqra Khalid continues to associate
with known anitsemite Amin El-Maoued, who advocates for violence and
discrimination against the Jewish community.




Khalid was forced to apologize last year for giving
El-Maoued a certificate of appreciation from Justin Trudeau. At the time Khalid
claimed she condemned his antisemitic views. 
But we now know her apology was a lie.
Recently Khalid attended an event at the home
of El-Maoued. He confirmed in social media posts that Khalid apologized to him
for condemning his antisemitism. El-Maoued blames the “Zionist lobby” for
forcing Khalid to having to issue a public apology.
In response to this news, Khalid says that she
accepts that El-Maoued is not antisemtic, despite the fact that he uses
antisemitic language and leads rallies to call for the destruction of Israel.
El-Maoued is active in the Liberal Party of
Canada, donating and attending party conventions with Justin Trudeau.
Antisemites like Khalid and El-Maoued feel they
have a home in Trudeau’s Liberal Party. 
But what Jewish Canadians are asking is: why did Justin Trudeau fire antisemite Hassan Guillet but continues to support Iqra Khalid?

Yesterday, the NDP let the cat out of the
bag: They are planning to form a coalition government with Justin Trudeau if
Canadians don’t elect a Conservative majority government on Oct. 21.
When asked about it today, Trudeau did not rule out a
Liberal/NDP coalition, which would see NDP MPs given key cabinet positions with
Trudeau as Prime Minister.
With Trudeau forced to rely on the NDP to hang on to
power, what will that mean for you?
An even higher carbon tax. Trudeau is already planning to hike
     the carbon tax if he’s re-elected. But to keep the NDP happy, he’ll have
     to hike it even higher.
      Fewer jobs. NDP economic policies fail
     everywhere they’ve been tried. With the NDP calling the shots, Trudeau
     will have to hike taxes, shut down industry, and kill jobs to hang on to
     power.
      Even bigger deficits. To meet the NDP’s demands, Trudeau
     will have to spend billions more than he was already planning to, racking
     up huge deficits that will threaten social programs like health care.
Justin Trudeau will pay any price to stay in power. And
it’s your money he will pay with.
There’s only one way for Canadians to stop this coalition
that you cannot afford: Vote for Andrew Scheer and elect a Conservative
majority government.

Singh doubled-down yesterday reminding Canadians that he’s “fully opposed to Trans Mountain”.Meanwhile, Trudeau’s star candidate in Quebec confirmed that under Trudeau’s plan “many of these [pipelines] are incompatible with the goals we have for 2030”.The Trudeau-NDP coalition is the coalition you can’t afford. Their radical position on pipeline development will mean fewer jobs for Canadians and less future revenue that can be put toward health care, education and social services across Canada.As a result, a Trudeau-NDP coalition would be forced to raise taxes on middle-class Canadians in order to fund any new health care spending.Only Andrew Scheer and the Conservative Party has a plan to build a national energy corridor that will encourage greater investment in the Canadian energy sector.

A new Conservative government will fund projects that get Canadians home faster, reduce commute times
A new Conservative government will fund the Ontario Line and Yonge
Subway Extension projects as part of a plan to prioritize projects that get
Canadians home faster, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension are two great
examples of projects that reduce commute times and relieve traffic congestion
for hard-working commuters,” Scheer said.
“These are exactly the kinds of infrastructure projects a new
Conservative government will prioritize and I’m pleased to announce that as
Prime Minister, my government will fund them.” 
The 7.4-kilometre Yonge Subway
Extension will connect Toronto to Markham, Vaughan and Richmond Hill – one of
the fastest growing regions in Ontario. The 15-kilometre Ontario Line will
increase capacity by 30 per cent on a critically needed east-west and
north-south route. 
Scheer was joined by Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti and Richmond
Hill Mayor David Barrow and pointed out that despite a $187 billion infrastructure
spending commitment, Justin Trudeau has failed to deliver much-needed commuter
infrastructure for Canadians.
“Justin Trudeau was elected on a promise to invest in
infrastructure and get these kinds of projects built. But four years later, he
has spent the money but has nothing to show for it. We got the deficits without
the infrastructure,” Scheer said. “Once again, he is not as advertised.”
Only Canada’s Conservatives have a plan to lower your taxes and
put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead. We will build the
desperately needed infrastructure Canadians need to get home faster at the end
of the day.
FACTS:
Commute times in Toronto are
up an
average of almost 8 per cent since 2013, with
an average commute of 42 minutes.The Ontario Line is estimated
to cost $10.9 billion and is scheduled to be complete by 2027.The Yonge Subway Extension is
estimated to cost $5.6 billion and should be operational right after the
Ontario Line opens. A new Conservative government
would fund projects that reduce commute times across the country like the George
Massey Tunnel replacement project in Vancouver and the third link across the
Saint Lawrence River in Québec City.According to the Parliamentary
Budget Officer (PBO), for every dollar
Justin Trudeau promised for infrastructure, he only spent 60 cents: “the
Government failed to spend about 40 per cent of its planned infrastructure
budget.” Analysis
showed that for all his spending, there are no substantial results to show for
it.In its analysis of Budget 2018,
the PBO reported:
“Budget 2018 provides an incomplete account of the changes to the Government’s
$186.7 billion infrastructure spending plan. PBO requested the new plan but it
does not exist.”If given four more years,
Justin Trudeau’s debt and never-ending deficits will delay badly needed
infrastructure, threatening the future of important projects like the Ontario
Line and Yonge Subway Extension, and doing nothing to reduce commute times.Trudeau’s Carbon tax will add
31 cents a litre to the price of gas, adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of
everyday essentials. In Ontario, his carbon tax will cost you over a thousand
dollars each and every year. 
ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:

Yet we find ourselves now in a more polarized, more divisive election than even the 2015 one.” Justin Trudeau disparages the 19 million Canadians these leaders represent. He is a hypocrite and cannot be trusted to unite Canadians. Trudeau is simply not as advertised. Regardless of our differences, or our political views, politicians should never pit Canadians against one another.

This is just another example of how Justin Trudeau will do and say anything to get re-elected, even turn Canadians against each other for his own political gain.

Conservatives unveil fully costed platform that eliminates Justin Trudeau’s deficit by 2024.
Today, Canada’s Conservatives released Andrew Scheer’s
Plan for You to Get Ahead, a fully
costed platform that details how a new Conservative government will live within
its means and put more money in your pockets.
In his remarks, Andrew Scheer
offered examples of how typical Canadian families will get ahead under a new
Conservative government:
Under a new Conservative government,
an average retired couple living in Tsawwassen will save $2,580 a year.Under a new Conservative government, a family of four – soon to be five –
in Montreal will save $4,642 a year.Under a new Conservative government,
a family of four in Markham will save $3,264 a year.
“Under
Justin Trudeau, Canadians are working harder and harder, but they’re just not
getting ahead. Everything keeps getting more expensive and if Trudeau is
re-elected, it will only get worse,” Scheer said.
“My Plan For You To Get Ahead is filled with
achievable and tangible ways that a new Conservative government under my
leadership will put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.”
The Conservative
platform also shows a costed and independently verified path back to a balanced
budget by 2024-2025. This will be done through a combination of spending
restraint and reductions to both corporate handouts to profitable corporations
and foreign aid to relatively wealthy countries.
“My
plan eliminates Justin Trudeau’s damaging deficits because Conservatives know a
balanced budget is the only way to make sure services like health care are
protected,” Scheer said. 
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will provide:
1. More money for you, for your kids, and for your retirement 
By scrapping Trudeau’s carbon tax, providing a Universal Tax Cut, taking the GST off home heating, making maternity benefits tax-free, boosting the RESP, increasing the Age Credit, bringing back tax credits for children’s arts, fitness, and learning, and introducing the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit.
2. More good jobs
By reversing Trudeau’s tax hikes on small business, creating a National Energy Corridor to generate opportunities, boosting innovation and commercialization, supporting economic immigration, promoting interprovincial trade, building infrastructure projects that reduce commute times and lower emissions, and more.
3. More innovation to fight climate change 
By taking the fight against climate change global and incentivizing industry to develop emissions-reducing technology that can be shared with the world’s highest-emitting countries.
4. More help at home
By supporting our veterans, improving our correctional system, securing our neighbourhoods, strengthening border protection, reducing health care wait times, and more.
5. More strength abroad 
By
confronting the global complexities of climate change, human migration,
cybersecurity, and national defence, renewing relationships with important
allies, and standing up for Canada on the world stage. 
“It’s
time to turn the page on four years of broken promises. As Canadians, it’s time
for Canadians to look to the future once again with confidence,” Scheer said. 
The
platform was verified by Jack Mintz, President’s Fellow at the University of
Calgary’s School of Public Policy.
“I
conclude, therefore, that the Conservative Party fiscal plan is reasonably
estimated, resulting in a budgetary balance in five years subject to
uncertainties that impact any economic forecast including those of the PBO,”
Mintz said.

Andrew Scheer will make it easier for
Canadian families to welcome a new child into their home by introducing EI
adoption leave benefits for adoptive parents and boosting the Adoption Expense
Tax Credit, David Sweet, the Conservative candidate for Flamborough-Glanbrook,
announced today.
“Every year, thousands of Canadians adopt a child. By
opening their homes and their hearts, these families provide stability, love,
and a brighter future for some of the most vulnerable in Canada and around the
world,” Sweet said. “Adoption is one of the most selfless things a Canadian can
do. At the same time, it can also involve significant investments of time and money.
Andrew Scheer will make it easier for Canadians to begin, expand, or complete
their family through adoption.”
A new Conservative government will introduce 15 weeks of
EI adoption leave benefits for Canadians who adopt a child under the age of 18.
A new Conservative government will also amend the Income Tax Act to boost the
Adoption Expense Tax Credit to $20,000, and make the tax credit fully
refundable. As a result, those who pay little to no federal income tax will be
eligible for up to the maximum amount.
Currently, the maximum tax savings a Canadian adoptive
family is eligible to receive in 2020 is $2,482. Under a new Conservative
government, that same family will receive $3,000,
which is an increase of $518. The tax credit
will continue to be indexed as is currently the case.
“Introducing EI adoption leave benefits for adoptive
parents and boosting the Adoption Expense Tax Credit are two of the measures a
new Conservative government will introduce to help Canadian families get
ahead,” Sweet said.

Conservative foreign policy will cut aid spending by 25% and put it back in the pockets of Canadian families
Today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer detailed
his plan for delivering strong Conservative leadership on the world stage.
On the same day the Munk debate on foreign policy
was supposed to take place before Justin Trudeau forced its cancellation, Scheer
shared details around four key pillars of his foreign policy plan which
include:
Cutting 25% of foreign
aid spending – The reduction will come from middle- and upper-income countries
as well as hostile regimes. We will use the savings to pay for policies that
help Canadians get ahead at home and also redirect
$700 million to strengthen foreign aid in the countries that need it most. We
will continue to work in partnership with leading Canadian aid organizations
including volunteer-focused groups who provide much-needed assistance to
developing countries.
Strengthening
Canada’s commitment to traditional alliances and providing additional military
and non-military support to Ukraine.
Advocating for human
rights on the world stage by using Canada’s Magnitsky legislation to target
hostile regimes like Iran.
Depoliticizing
military procurement in order to properly and expediently supply the Canadian
Armed Forces.
“Justin Trudeau has spent the last four years
humiliating himself and all Canadians on the world stage with his weak,
unprincipled leadership,” Scheer said. “Canadians deserve a Prime Minister that
will once again make them proud and who will always stand up for Canada’s
interests in an increasingly hostile world.”
Scheer highlighted the long and growing list of
scandals and humiliations that have harmed Canada’s reputation during Justin
Trudeau’s time in power, including his admiration for China’s “basic
dictatorship,” his praise for Cuban communist dictator Fidel Castro, his disastrous
India trip, and his disgraceful Omar Khadr settlement.
On foreign aid, Scheer said his plan will refocus Canadian
help where it is most needed while helping more Canadians get ahead at home.
“At a time when Canadians are working harder than
ever and not getting ahead, Trudeau is using their hard-earned tax dollars to
support antisemitic organizations and prop up foreign dictatorships,” Scheer
concluded. “Our plan will take Canadian tax dollars away from corrupt dictators
and wealthy countries and return it to Canadians so they can get ahead.
“At the same time, we will continue to consider aid proposals
which support non-development objectives such as minority rights and peaceful
coexistence taking place in any country,” Scheer said.

Trudeau Liberals to send another $2.544 billion dollars in debt interest payments to bankers and foreign creditors
Canadians know that Justin Trudeau is not
as advertised, and now we know that their platform is not as advertised either.

The Trudeau Liberals are failing to
account for changes in public debt charges as a result of their endless
deficits. 
In total, the Trudeau Liberal platform will send an additional $2.544 billion dollars to bankers and foreign creditors to pay for their out-of-control spending. 

The PBO offered all parties costing tools
to determine the changes to public debt charges. Clearly, the Trudeau Liberals
didn’t use these tools or the Trudeau Liberals intentionally left the numbers
out of their fiscal track. 
On top of that, a number of Trudeau Liberal promises remain un-costed by an independent analysis:  
Pharmacare; 
Net-zero emissions by 2050; 
Assigning a family doctor to every Canadian; 
Lowering after-school fees by 10 per cent; 
 High
speed internet across the country
Guaranteed paid family leave; 
With the release of their platform, Justin
Trudeau’s Liberals are doubling down on their endless deficits that threaten
the social services, like health care and education, we all depend on. 
If Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are
re-elected, they will do what they did last time and hike your taxes to pay for
their out-of-control spending. 
Additional information: 
Justin Trudeau’s campaign promises added to his existing deficits will pile on $100 billion of new      debt to the books;His deficit will hit $27.4 billion in 2020; and,Total debt by the end of Justin Trudeau’s second term would be over $800 billion.
What does that mean for you? Justin
Trudeau’s never-ending spending will threaten the quality of our health and
social programs. He will be forced to raise taxes to pay for his endless debt
and deficits.

Justin Trudeau is scheming up a plot to
cling to power by forming a coalition with the NDP. This is the coalition that
you cannot afford.
We know that the Trudeau-NDP coalition will mean:
Higher taxes;Bigger deficits;And, fewer good-paying jobs.
The last time there was a Liberal-NDP coalition was from
October 1972 to July 8, 1974 under Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.

In less than two years,
the Liberal-NDP coalition:
Jacked up personal income taxes by 40 per cent.Increased taxes on job creators by 66 per cent.Raised other taxes by 61 per cent.Increased Canada’s total debt by 19 per cent.

Trudeau bailing on Munk debate shows he can’t be trusted to represent Canada on the international stage
The Munk Leaders Debate on Foreign Policy was
cancelled after Justin Trudeau refused to show up and debate Andrew Scheer and
other leaders. 
It’s not surprising that Trudeau is running from his
record of disastrous foreign policy decisions, embarrassing behaviour, and
refusal to stand up for Canada’s interests against hostile foreign powers. 
When Justin Trudeau was first elected in 2015 he
proclaimed that Canada was back. Instead, he has diminished Canada’s role on
the world stage by:
Pulling our troops out of the fight against ISIS and
initially refusing to acknowledge the genocide being committed by the Islamic
State;Damaging relations with Canada’s allies like Japan and
Australia;Embarrassing Canadians by bringing a known terrorist
on an official visit to India;Refusing to list the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps as a terrorist entity;Sending millions of Canadian taxpayers dollars to the
Beijing-controlled Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank at the same time that
the government is holding two Canadians hostage on specious charges; andGiving $110 million to the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency, which supports terrorism and antisemitism. 
But perhaps the biggest hit to Canada’s international reputation came last week when Justin Trudeau made headlines all over the world for wearing blackface on multiple occasions. Justin Trudeau cannot be trusted to represent Canada with dignity and poise on the international stage. He is not as advertised.

Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, today released the following statement on Bandi Chhor Divas:
“Today, Sikhs across Canada and around the world will be celebrating Bandi Chhor Divas.  
“Bandi Chhor Divas marks a significant moment in Sikh history – the day when the sixth Guru, Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, freed 52 prisoners imprisoned by the Mughal Emperor and returned triumphantly to Amritsar. This historic event is symbolic and demonstrative of the role that Sikhs have and continue to play in protecting and serving the community.

“The Sikh faith is known for promoting the values of prayer, selfless service to others, and honest living. Today, in celebration of these virtues, Sikhs will be lighting divas, singing songs of praise and attending prayers at Gurdwaras across the country.  
“As divas and fireworks light up the night, all Canadians can reflect today on the freedoms and blessings that make Canada the great country that it is while praying for a brighter and more prosperous future.

 New Conservative government to remove museum admission fees, celebrate past Prime Ministers 
A new Conservative government will scrap
admission fees from all of Canada’s national museums, Conservative Leader
Andrew Scheer announced today.
Removing these fees will make it easier for families to
learn about Canada’s proud history and will make school field trips and family
vacations more affordable.
“National museums celebrate Canada by sharing our
foundational stories and most cherished artifacts, the very things that make us
Canadian. They are places of beauty, discovery, and inspiration,” said Scheer.
“Making them more accessible to Canadians and visitors is part of our plan to
celebrate Canadian culture and make life more affordable for families across
the country.”
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will make it free to
visit national museums 365 days a year for every visitor.
There are nine national museums across Canada:
Canada Agriculture and Food Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum of History (Gatineau, Quebec)Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 (Halifax, Nova Scotia)Canada Science and Technology Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa, Ontario)Canada Aviation and Space Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum of Nature (Ottawa, Ontario)Canadian Museum for Human Rights (Winnipeg, Manitoba)Canadian War Museum (Ottawa, Ontario)
A new Conservative government will also designate the RCMP
Heritage Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan as a national museum. Admission would
also be free.
Scheer announced that a new Conservative government will
also designate the gravesites of past Prime Ministers and Governors General as
national historic sites.
“We can and we should celebrate the achievements of our
historical giants like William Lyon Mackenzie King, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and
Sir John A. Macdonald,” Scheer said. “These leaders, and others, have left
their mark not only on our country, but on the entire world and they are worthy
of honour and respect.”
FACTS:
The first National Museum of Canada was established by the Department of Mines in 1927.The current system of national museums (listed above) are administered by six Crown Corporations.According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, this move would save Canadians more than $20 million per year.Admission fees generally represent small proportions of these museums’ revenue mix; these other revenue streams, including Parliamentary appropriations, will not be impacted by this measure, except to increase the appropriations to compensate for reduced revenue from this policy.Smithsonian Institution museums in Washington, D.C. have offered free admission since 1846.

Investment will reduce wait times for potentially life-saving scans 
A new Conservative government will invest $1.5 billion in its
first term to purchase MRI machines and CT machines to replace aging equipment and
add machines across the country, reducing wait times for potentially
life-saving tests for Canadians, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
“Hundreds of thousands of Canadians wait longer than the recommended
time for an MRI or a CT scan. That is just not good enough”, said Scheer. “This
investment will help our health care providers to deliver quality services with
the most up-to-date technology, giving patients quicker access to reliable,
potentially life-saving tests.”
Justin Trudeau’s never-ending deficits and out-of-control
spending have put Canada on track to hit $1 trillion in debt by 2035. If
Trudeau is given four more years, his debt and never-ending deficits will
threaten our ability to deliver quality public services like health and social
programs.
A
new Conservative government will live within its means to protect health care
in the long term. As written in a letter to all Premiers in August 2019, as
Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will maintain and increase the current funding
formula for the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer. 
“Canadians need a government that understands that balancing the budget is the best way to maintain the services that they rely on the most, including health care,” Scheer said. “Canada’s Conservatives will give you more help for your health, so you can get ahead.”
FACTS:
Justin Trudeau said he would balance the budget
by 2019. Instead, he has raised taxes, imposed a carbon tax, and his massive overspending
now puts health and social programs at risk.According to a recent report
by the Conference
Board of Canada, Canada’s stock of MRI and CT
machines is aging, supply is not keeping up with demand, and wait times for
these important diagnostic tests exceed the wait-time recommendations from the
Canadian Association of Radiologists. By upgrading and increasing available
medical imaging equipment, Canadians will have better, faster access to quality
tests. Getting earlier access to a test could mean an earlier diagnosis for the
patient. In addition to improving wait
times, this investment will also give provincial governments some additional
spending flexibility, as the federal government would pick up the bill for
replacing out-of-date imaging equipment that the provinces would likely have to
replace. Demand for medical imaging
tests is only expected to increase as our population ages.

New Conservative government to make it easier for volunteers to qualify for tax credits recognizing their service 
A new Conservative government will allow more search and rescue volunteers and volunteer firefighters to qualify for tax savings, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today. 
“Communities across Canada rely on
volunteers for essential services like fire protection and search and rescue,”
Scheer said. “These are people of courage, character, and strength who step up
when their neighbours need it most, often at significant personal expense. A
new Conservative government will recognize this service and sacrifice by making
it easier for them to qualify for tax savings so they can get ahead.”
A new Conservative government will put
more money back in the pockets of these hometown heroes by reducing the number
of service hours required to qualify for federal tax credits from 200 to 150
hours per year.
Volunteers
often pay out-of-pocket for equipment, uniforms, transportation, training, and
insurance – costs that run into the thousands of dollars. 
Volunteers
will continue to receive a $450 rebate every year. The Parliamentary Budget
Officer estimates that lowering the number of required hours by 50 will allow more
than 5,000 additional volunteers to apply for and receive these benefits. 
Scheer
made today’s announcement in New Brunswick, where volunteer search and rescue
teams have been active for more than 35 years. Upper Kingsclear also relies on volunteer
firefighters for its protection, several of whom were on hand for today’s announcement.
 “A new Conservative government will live
within its means and put more money back in your pockets – for you, for your
family, and your retirement,” Scheer said. 
FACTS:
Last
year, the National Fire Protection Association reports that of the 152,650 local firefighters
in Canada from 2014-16, 126,650 (83 per cent) were volunteers. That same report
found that of 3,672 fire departments in Canada, 3,061 are all-volunteer.The
Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada (SARVAC) says 9,000 volunteers serve on 300 search and
rescue teams across the country. All told, these volunteers contribute more
than 600,000 hours of training, administration, and searches each year.The
previous Conservative government introduced the Volunteer Firefighter Tax Credit
in Budget 2011 and the Search and Rescue Volunteer Tax
Credit in Budget 2014.In
2016, nearly 43,000 individuals claimed the Volunteer Firefighter Tax Credit
and 4,800 individuals claimed the Search and Rescue Volunteer Tax Credit.Justin
Trudeau has done nothing with these tax credits and nothing for these
volunteers.

Oliphant explains how “conflicted” he is about Remembrance Day and
his belief that it tends to “glorify war.”

deserve.

our Veterans are heroes. They dedicated their lives to protecting us.  Now it is our responsibility to respect their
service by doing our part to look out for them.

After media reports revealed that Justin
Trudeau wore blackface during an event at West Point Grey Academy, Canadians
have been asking why exactly Justin Trudeau left his teaching job at the
school. It’s understandable why people have questions, after all Trudeau’s
story has changed four times since 2001. 
First, the Ottawa Citizen reported in 2001
that Trudeau would “give up his teaching job at
a Vancouver private school next September to give speeches.” Several days later
this claim was refuted by Trudeau in a statement issued by lawfirm Heenan
Blaikie. The Montreal Gazette reported Trudeau was accepting a teaching job at
a public school. 
In his 2014 autobiography, Trudeau says he
left the school after a dispute with the administration over an article written
in the school newspaper. According to Trudeau, he convinced a student to write
an article criticizing the fact that the girls at the school were never
reprimanded for the way they dress. This article was deemed disrespectful by
the school’s administration. 
The Vancouver Sun reported in 2015 that the reason Trudeau left the school was “in part over a dispute over dress code and values.”
In a 2019
book by John Ivison, Trudeau’s departure is summed up as “a disagreement over
an article written by a student for which Trudeau was responsible”.
On October 4, 2019 Trudeau said he left the school “because [he] was moving on
with [his] life”.
That same day, the former headmaster of
the school said that Trudeau left the school because he was going to study to
be an engineer.

New tax credit will allow Canadians to save up to $3,800 on green home renovations
Conservative
Leader Andrew Scheer was at Potvin & Bouchard today, highlighting the Conservatives’
proposed Green Home Renovation Tax Credit, a two-year program to encourage
homeowners to renovate their homes in ways that lower their power bills and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Canadians
will be eligible to receive a 20% refundable credit on their income tax for
green improvements to their homes of over $1,000 and up to $20,000. This would
allow Canadians to save up to $3,800
on their renovations each year.
Eligible renovations would include: 
Installation of high-quality insulation Investments in high-efficiency furnaces Replacement of doors and windows with more efficient models Upgrading of ventilation, heating and cooling systemsInstallation of solar panels 
In
2017, emissions from buildings represented 12% of Canada’s overall emissions. 
“No
environmental plan is complete without a serious plan to tackle emissions from
buildings,” Scheer said. “Our Green Home Renovation Tax Credit will help lower
these emissions and fight climate change while putting more money in Canadians’
pockets so they can get ahead.”
This measure is one of the 55 policies of our environmental plan, A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment, introduced earlier this year. It is a realistic plan that balances Canada’s obligation to fight climate change with the core Conservative promise to put more money in Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead.
FACTS:
Justin Trudeau’s signature so-called environmental policy is, in reality, not an environmental policy at all. His Carbon Tax gives big polluters a pass while punishing Canadians for driving to work and heating their homes.Canadian families and small businesses pay 92% of Trudeau’s Carbon Tax, while big polluters are only on the hook for 8%. Justin Trudeau and his environment minister have confirmed that a carbon tax hike is on the table, and the Conservative Party conducted research to determine just how much it would cost the average Canadian household. At the $102/ tonne level, Trudeau’s Carbon Tax would Increase the cost of natural gas by $469 per year Add 31 cents/litre to the price of gasoline. This means $2/litre gasoline is just around the corner if the Trudeau Liberals are re-elected. It is Canadians who bear the cost of Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax. In Ontario, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,151.In New Brunswick, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $959.In Manitoba, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,116.In Saskatchewan, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $1,930.In Alberta, the five-fold increase to the carbon tax would cost you $2,002.
Andrew Scheer’s Plan for you to get ahead:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax,

Trudeau continues to assert that media stories are false despite ruling that he broke the law
Last night Justin Trudeau unrepentantly lied
again to Canadians about the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal. In a debate
exchange with Mr. Scheer, Justin Trudeau shockingly asserted that a Globe and Mail
story, which first detailed how Justin Trudeau attempted to interfere in an
ongoing corruptions and fraud court case, was false.

How do Canadians know Justin Trudeau lied last night? Check the record:
Trudeau was investigated by the Ethics Commissioner who determined he broke the law over the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal; Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould confirmed      to a House of Commons committee that Trudeau pressured her to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin court case;Trudeau’s two most senior staff resigned in disgrace and former cabinet minister Jane Philpot resigned      in protest over Trudeau’s unethical behavior; andThe RCMP were blocked from investigating Justin Trudeau’s office.
Despite all this, Justin Trudeau still says the Globe and
Mail story is false.
Why? Because Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. He is a
fraud and he does not deserve to govern this country.
To ensure this never happens again, a Conservative
government will launch a judicial inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin corruption
scandal and introduce the No More Cover Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access
information protected by cabinet confidence.

Conservatives will spend final week outlining government agenda for first 100 days
Over the next several days, Conservative
Leader Andrew Scheer will announce the first things a new Conservative
government will do during its first 100 days in office.
“Canadians are getting ready to elect a new government and
I plan on telling them exactly what we will do in our first 100 days,” Scheer
said. “I am ready. My team is ready. We have a plan to put more money in your
pockets so you can get ahead and we will hit the ground running on day one.”
Scheer unveiled the Conservative platform earlier today in
Tsawwassen, BC – a fully costed plan that will put thousands of dollars back
into Canadians’ pockets while also eliminating Justin Trudeau’s deficits by
2024.
Scheer said he will spend the final week of the campaign
travelling the country announcing to Canadians specific things he will do as
soon as he becomes Prime Minister.
“In 2015, Justin Trudeau made a lot of promises to get
elected – and he started breaking them as soon as he was sworn into office,”

through on what we’ve committed to.”

Today, Justin
Trudeau and the Liberals are unveiling their election platform – much like the
2015 version it’s not worth the wasted ink and the paper it’s printed on. 
In the last
election, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals promised a lot, but once elected they
broke promise after promise and made life more expensive and unaffordable for
families. Plain and simple, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. If Justin
Trudeau is re-elected he will once again break his promises to Canadians and
raise taxes on hard-working Canadian families. 
Let’s take a
look at some of Justin Trudeau’s most notable broken promises. 
Balanced
Budgets: 
“I am
looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way I always have. We’ve
said we are committed to balanced budgets and we are. We will balance that
budget in 2019.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
It’s 2019, and
as we can see the budget did not “balance itself.” Justin Trudeau is running
endless deficits that threaten the social services Canadians depend on and if
re-elected Trudeau will just raise your taxes to pay for his out of control
spending. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Electoral
Reform: 
“As Prime
Minister, I’ll make sure the 2015 election will be the last under
first-past-the-post system.” – Justin Trudeau, 2015
There’s another
election, and guess what? It’s being held under first-past-the-post. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Veterans: 
“Our plan
will give back to those who have given so much in service to all Canadians, and
will ensure that no veteran has to fight the government for the support and compensation
they have earned.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election Platform
Justin Trudeau
looked a military hero in the eye – a man who lost his leg fighting for our
country – and said that veterans are “asking for more than we are able to
give.” 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Accountability:

“We will
restore trust in our democracy.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015 Election
Platform
Justin Trudeau
was the first Prime Minister in our country’s history to be found guilty of
breaking ethics laws, and he did it not once but twice! 
Justin Trudeau
has stonewalled the Ethics Commissioner, shut-down parliamentary committees
search for answers into Liberal corruption scandals, and he is now doing
everything in his power to block the RCMP from investigating his office. 
Justin Trudeau
is not as advertised. 
Lower Taxes
for the Middle Class: 
“We will
give middle class Canadians a tax break.” – Liberal Party of Canada, 2015
Election Platform
Justin Trudeau
has raised taxes on 80 per cent of middle-class families, and his carbon tax
punishes everyday moms and dads driving their kids to hockey practice. 
If Justin
Trudeau is re-elected, his carbon tax is going to increase the price of
gasoline by 31 cents per litre.

Justin Trudeau is scheming up a plot to
cling to power by forming a coalition with the NDP. This is the coalition that
you cannot afford.

We know that the Trudeau-NDP Coalition will mean:
Higher taxes;Higher deficits;And, fewer good-paying jobs.
But, what exactly does it mean for you? We did the math.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has listed his five demands to be a part of the
coalition:
Wealth
TaxPharmacareUniversal
Dental CareAffordable
HousingRemoving
Interest from Federal Student Loans
When you combine these promises with the Liberal platform,
it will mean even bigger deficits and higher taxes.
The Liberal/NDP Coalition Deficits will average $34.7
billion over the next four years.

To pay just half of their deficits, the coalition would have to:
Raise the lowest personal income tax bracket from 15% to 19.5%Raise the GST from 5% to 7.5%Cut the Canada Health Transfer by 41%Cut the Canada Social Transfer by 100%

SEPTEMBER 29, 2019
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OTTAWA, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s
Conservatives and the Official Opposition, issued the following statement:
“This evening, at sundown,
the Jewish communities in Canada and around the world prepare to mark Rosh Hashanah
– the New Year- and the beginning of the High Holy Days.
“Rosh Hashanah is celebrated
on the first two days of the month of Tishrei, and marks the beginning of the
ten days of repentance during which Jews around the world will reflect on their
actions over the past year and seek forgiveness.
“As friends and families
share meals with sweet challah and apple slices dipped in honey, they will
reflect on renewal, and hope for an abundant year ahead.
“Canada has been blessed by
the strong presence of the Canadian Jewish community who enrich our country’s
culture and values of pluralism and freedom. As the Jewish community remains a
targeted group for hate-related offences, this Rosh Hashanah, let us recommit
ourselves to combating all forms of antisemitism and work together to educate
and to better our country.
“On behalf of the Canada’s
Conservatives, I extend my best wishes to the Jewish community, across Canada
and around the world, celebrating Rosh Hashanah and hope for a peaceful and
prosperous year ahead.

New Conservative government will work with provinces to break down trade barriers
In his first 100 days as Prime Minister,
Andrew Scheer will meet with Canada’s Premiers to establish a new
interprovincial free trade agreement that will create jobs and opportunities
for Canadians from coast to coast.
Scheer will host the meeting in Ottawa on January 6, 2020.
“Trade barriers between provinces mean Canadians are
missing out on so much opportunity and prosperity,” Scheer said. “As Prime
Minister, I will work with the provinces to get Canadian goods and services
moving across the country to put more money in Canadians’ pockets.”
Eliminating interprovincial trade barriers would improve
Canada’s competitiveness and productivity, potentially boosting Canada’s
economy by as much as $90 billion, according to the International Monetary
Fund.
In 2015, Justin Trudeau promised to usher in a new era of
provincial and territorial relations. Instead, he is pitting the provinces
against each other, forcing his carbon tax on provinces that have rejected it,
and picking fights with provincial leaders whose help he would need to keep his
election promises.
“Trudeau’s my-way-or-the-highway, Ottawa-knows-best
approach is costing Canadians,” Scheer said. “Canadians are working harder than
ever but just aren’t getting ahead, losing out on billions in trade and opportunity.
Only a new Conservative government will work with the provinces and territories
to create the kind of economic prosperity and opportunity that will put more
money in your pockets so you can get ahead.”
FACTS:
At this meeting, a new Conservative government will create a process to determine whether differences in laws and regulations unnecessarily prevent trade or whether they are reasonable exercises of provincial jurisdiction.While Canada has signed on to free-trade agreements with countries around the world, there are significant barriers to the free flow of goods and services within our own borders.Alberta Premier  that he would immediately remove 13 of 27 Jason Kenney recently announced     exemptions under the existing Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), and launch a review of the remaining 14.Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister also announced that effective immediately, the Manitoba government is removing a number of its exemptions under the CFTA to further reduce interprovincial trade barriers.To increase opportunities for Canadians to work anywhere in Canada, a new Conservative government will expand the Red Seal Program to recognize common credentials. We will work with the provinces and territories to harmonize apprenticeship training and trade certification in their jurisdictions.

ANDREW SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET
AHEAD:
Scrap the Trudeau Carbon Tax, lowering the cost of everyday essentials like gas, groceries, and home heating.Introduce the Universal Tax Cut, saving an average couple $850.Take the GST off home heating costs, saving your family $107 every year.Introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit,      saving a family of four who take transit up to $1,000.Make maternity benefits tax-free, putting up to $4,000 back in the pockets of new parents.Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit,      allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax      Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and      learning programs.Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost government-matching to RESPs by 50 per cent, helping parents get more for their kids’ education.Introduce the Green Home Renovation Tax Credit,      putting up to $3,800 back in the pockets of Canadians for green home improvements.

In the face of scandal, Trudeau reveals platform, making billions in farcical promises to Canadians  
In
an attempt to cover up international embarrassment, Justin Trudeau has revealed
his platform, announcing a staggering $57 billion in campaign promises. The
tally of his disastrous campaign is mounting, and so is his debt. 
“Justin
Trudeau will do or say anything to get re-elected. If given four more years, we
know that Trudeau is going to raise your taxes to pay for his out of control
spending,” said Pierre Poilievre, MP Carleton at a media availability in
Ottawa.
To
reveal the true cost of Justin Trudeau’s poor judgement, the Conservative Party
has once again done the math:
Justin
Trudeau’s campaign promises added to his existing deficits will pile on $100
billion of new debt to the books; His
deficit will hit $27.4 billion in 2020; and, Total
debt by the end of Justin Trudeau’s second term would be over $800 billion.  
What
does that mean for you? Justin Trudeau’s never-ending spending will threaten
the quality of our health and social programs. He will be forced to raise taxes
to pay for his endless debt and deficits. 
To
pay just half of Justin Trudeau’s deficits ($14B), he would have to either:
Raise
the GST by 2% or; Raise
the rate on the first income tax bracket from 15% to 19% or;Raise
the rate on the second income tax bracket from 20.5% to 27% or; Lower
the basic personal amount from $12,069 to $6,869. 
Further,
by reaching $823 billion in total debt, Trudeau is will spend $35 billion on
interest payments alone. That’s $35 billion that will not go to Canadians’
priorities.
Justin
Trudeau campaigned on a promise to help the middle class. Instead, he raised
taxes on 80 per cent of middle-class Canadians and imposed a carbon tax that
makes everyday essential more expensive. If Justin Trudeau is re-elected, his
carbon tax is going to increase the price of gasoline by 31 cents per litre. 
“This
election will come down to the choice between a government who thinks they can
spend your money better than you, raises taxes, and makes your life more
unaffordable – and a new Conservative government that will lower your taxes and
put more money in your pocket,” said Poilievre. 
JUSTIN
TRUDEAU’S BROKEN PROMISES:

Budgets: 
“I

A new Conservative government will work with provinces and territories to protect waters
Conservative candidate for Richmond-Arthabaska Alain Rayes was joined by Robert Coutu, candidate for La Pointe-de-l’île, and spoke at Parc de l’hôtel de ville about Canada’s Conservative’s plan to protect our waters. A new Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer will work with the provinces and municipalities to put an end to raw sewage being dumped in waterways across Canada. 
“Our waterways should not be used as a toxic dumping ground and it’s
our responsibility to protect these vital natural assets for future generations
to enjoy,” said Rayes. “In one of her first acts as environment minister,
Catherine McKenna gave the go-ahead to the City of Montreal to dump eight
billion litres of raw sewage into one of Canada’s most iconic waterways, the
Saint Lawrence River. It’s disgusting and it’s wrong. We will help put an end
to it.”
Eight billion litres is the equivalent of 3,200 Olympic-sized
swimming pools.
In
2017 alone, municipalities dumped 215 billion litres of raw sewage untreated
into lakes and rivers across the country. 
“Since taking office, Justin Trudeau has failed to protect our waterways
from pollution,” said Rayes. “This is not acceptable. Trudeau is putting the
biodiversity values of our land, waterways, and marine environments at risk.”
When it comes to the environment, Justin
Trudeau makes big promises and then fails to deliver. He claims his government
is on track to reduce
Canada’s emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 but reports by his own
government say he’s not even close. When it comes to protecting our
environment, Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. 
Canada’s Conservatives have a proud legacy when it comes to
managing Canada’s natural environment and improving Canada’s environmental
performance. A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment builds on
this proud legacy andwill further
lower Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen environmental
protections, with the core Conservative
promise to put more money in Canadians’ pockets so they can get ahead.
FACTS:
Since coming to
power, Justin Trudeau has done nothing to tackle this problem. He continues to
use our waterways as a dumping ground for toxic waste.In 2007, the
previous Conservative government implemented the Lake Simcoe Clean-Up Fund. It
funded over 200 community-based projects that restored fish and wildlife
populations, planted thousands of new trees, and reduced harmful sewage and
waste dumps into watersheds. The Trudeau Liberals cancelled the fund in 2017. The previous Conservative
government had an excellent track record on waste management. We created the
Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations to set higher standards for wastewater
treatment, and made wastewater investments across the country.Canada’s Conservatives
recognize the global environmental impact of climate change. That is why we

emissions, built on three guiding principles: Green Technology, Not TaxesA Cleaner and Greener Natural Environment Taking the Climate Change Fight Global

Conservative plan takes real action to fight crime vs. Trudeau’s do-nothing gun ban
A new Conservative government will take real
action to fight gang and gun violence, combat human trafficking, and tackle
drug addictions and recovery, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced
today.
“As Prime Minister, I will lead a government that
honours its most sacred duty – to keep its citizens and their streets safe,”
Scheer said. “Justin Trudeau has failed in this regard and all of his proposed
measures to fight crime simply will not work. Canadians can’t trust him to keep
them safe.”  
The Conservative plan for safer streets targets
illegal firearms crossing the border and ending up with gangsters, while
strengthening penalties to keep gang and gun criminals behind bars.  
As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer’s plan for A
Safer Canada will: 
End automatic bail
for gang members awaiting trial and revoke parole for any gang member who
associates with their former gang following release.
Identify known
gangs as criminal entities in the Criminal Code, similar to how terrorist
organizations are currently listed.
Bring in tougher
sentences, including a five-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for violent
gang crime, with a new five-year minimum mandatory prison sentence for
possession of a smuggled firearm. 
Create a Canada
Border Services Agency firearms smuggling task force to intercept illegal
firearms at the Canada-US border.
Strengthen
background checks for gun licenses and make it a crime to provide a firearm to
anyone who has been prohibited from owning them. 
Revise the
Canadian drugs and substance strategy to focus on helping Canadians recover
from addiction.
Strengthen human trafficking laws, including consecutive sentences for
those who are convicted on multiple counts of human trafficking and ensuring
Canada meets our commitments under the Palermo Protocol. 
Scheer contrasted the detailed Conservative plan
with Trudeau’s vague firearms ban that will do nothing to crack down on gun
crime.
“Forcing law-abiding Canadians to follow even
more laws will not reduce crime,” Scheer said. “Criminals don’t follow laws and
that’s exactly why we have to target them. My plan does the hard work of
tracking down criminals and putting them behind bars where they belong so you
and your family can be safe and get ahead.”

New Conservative government to repeal Trudeau tax increases and reduce red tape
Small
business owners can look forward to a new Conservative government repealing
Justin Trudeau’s tax increases and cutting red tape, announced Andrew Scheer at
Cracker Jack’s Bar and Grill today. 
“Justin
Trudeau thinks small businesses are tax cheats, “said Scheer. “In the last four
years, it has become more expensive than ever to run a business. Trudeau’s
Carbon Tax raised the price of gasoline and heating, making it harder to pay
monthly bills. His payroll tax hikes hurt the bottom line, and his
unprecedented tax hike on small businesses in 2017 – although Canada’s
Conservatives and business leaders came together to try to stop it – ended up
costing small businesses even more.”

make a living and grow their business.

only are small businesses victim to the Trudeau government’s tax hikes, small
businesses across the country are also struggling under a massive regulatory
burden. Justin Trudeau has imposed more than 4,300 job-killing, growth-choking
federal regulations on Canadian business since 2015. 
A
new Conservative government will take several measures to support our small
businesses: 
Repeal
Trudeau’s tax increases on small business investments Exempt
spouses from Trudeau’s tax increases on small business dividends Make
it easier to navigate Canada’s tax system and the Canada Revenue AgencyReduce
federal regulations by 25 per centImplement
a 2-for-1 rule for new regulations Assign
a Minister reporting directly to the Prime Minister to lead red tape reduction
effortsMandate
ministers and regulators to support innovation, economic growth, and global
competitiveness Champion
Canada’s small businesses to the world  
“A
new Conservative government will continue to celebrate small businesses as
drivers of prosperity, and not view them merely as sources of revenue,” said
Scheer. “It’s time to stop Justin Trudeau’s attacks on small business owners.
It is time for Canada’s small businesses to get ahead.”
FACTS:
Of
the 95,000 businesses that are created in Canada each year, barely 50 per cent
will survive to celebrate their tenth anniversary. Over the last four years, it
has become more difficult than ever to start and grow a business.In
2017, Trudeau proposed a disastrous set of small business tax increases that
were only partially abandoned because of effective pressure by Canada’s
Conservatives and massive public outcry.Trudeau
tried to hike taxes on small businesses’ investment income to 73 per cent, and
then went after small business owners’ spouses, ending a long-standing tax
exemption on dividend payments. The
Canadian Chamber of Commerce (CCC) reports there were 131,754 federal regulations
on the books when Justin Trudeau took office in 2015. Public policy think-tank
MEI reports that by 2018, the number of federal
regulations rose to 136,121 – an increase of more than 4,300.In
late 2018, the Financial Post reported that regulatory burden was
“killing Canada’s competitiveness.”

SCHEER’S PLAN FOR YOU TO GET AHEAD:

Introduce the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit,      allowing parents to claim up to $1,000 for sports activities.Introduce the Children’s Arts and Learning Tax      Credit, letting parents claim up to $500 for arts and learning programs. Expand the Age Credit, benefiting the lowest      income Canadians the most and giving a senior couple up to $300.Boost the RESP, helping parents get more for their kids’ education. For some, that could be $540 more.

OCTOBER 8, 2019
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Ottawa, ON – The Hon. Andrew Scheer, Leader of Canada’s Conservatives and of the Official Opposition, today released the following statement on Yom Kippur:
“This evening at sundown, the Jewish community in Canada and around the world will join together to mark the beginning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.
“Yom Kippur, marks the end of the High Holy Days. It is a time to focus on repentance and to atone for the sins of the past year. This day of fasting will begin with the Kol Nidrei service, marking the start of a period of reflection, seeking forgiveness for wrong-doings and looking ahead to starting the New Year with a clean slate.
“The Jewish community across Canada has played an integral role in all areas of Canadian society. Today, Canada is home to one of the largest and most engaged Jewish populations in the world. On this day, I hope that Canadians take the opportunity to recognize our common values and the immense contributions made by the Jewish community in shaping a more peaceful and prosperous Canada.
“On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, I would like to extend our warmest wishes to the Jewish community here at home and around the world as they observe this sacred fast day.

A new Conservative government will prioritize critical
infrastructure projects that shorten commute times like the George Massey
Tunnel replacement in the Greater Vancouver Area, Conservative Leader Andrew
Scheer announced today.
“Canadians are sick and tired of being stuck in traffic and
waiting for delayed public transit,” said Scheer. “Canada’s Conservatives will
get on with real projects that reduce congestion and deliver faster commute
times for everyone, whether you drive or catch public transit.”
Examples of the type of projects that would be prioritized for
funding include:
The George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project (British Columbia)The Ontario Line and the Yonge Subway Extension (Ontario)The third link between Quebec City and Levis (Québec)
Scheer pointed out how, despite making a $187-billion
infrastructure spending commitment in the 2015 election, Justin Trudeau has
failed to deliver important projects for Canadian commuters.
“He’s made billions in promises but hasn’t delivered. When it
comes to getting shovels in the ground and getting projects built, Justin
Trudeau is not as advertised,” Scheer said.
A new Conservative government will also restore transparency to
infrastructure spending by scrapping Justin Trudeau’s $35-billion Infrastructure
Bank which has been nothing but a waste of taxpayer dollars, adding countless
layers of red tape, delaying desperately needed transportation infrastructure,
and doing nothing to decrease commute times.
Scheer added, “As Prime Minister, I will ensure that all
infrastructure projects that have already been committed to will move forward. Going
forward, a new Conservative government will have a strategy in place to prioritize
future transportation projects on whether they lower commute times and also provide
more housing options for Canadians.”
FACTS:
Statistics Canada found that 1.5
million Canadians spent at least an hour commuting to work in 2016.According to the Parliamentary
Budget Officer (PBO), for every dollar
Justin Trudeau promised for infrastructure, he only spent 60 cents: “the
Government failed to spend about 40 per cent of its planned infrastructure
budget.” Analysis
showed that for all his spending, there are no substantial results to show for
it.In its analysis of Budget 2018,
the PBO reported:
“Budget 2018 provides an incomplete account of the changes to the Government’s
$186.7 billion infrastructure spending plan. PBO requested the new plan but it
does not exist.”If given four more years,
Justin Trudeau’s debt and never-ending deficits will delay badly needed
infrastructure, threatening the future of important projects like the George
Massey Tunnel replacement.

A new Conservative government will bring back the Hunting and Angling Advisory 
Michelle
Rempel, Conservative candidate for Calgary Nose Hill, spoke
today in Calgary about the Conservatives’ plan to give hunters and anglers a
voice in protecting Canada’s natural habitats by re-establishing the Hunting
and Angling Advisory Panel.
“The Trudeau Liberals cut the Hunting and
Angling Advisory Panel and chose to lose touch with what is happening in our
local communities,” said Rempel. “Canada’s hunters and anglers make significant
contributions to the preservation of species and habitats and can offer
valuable advice on the stewardship of Canada’s wildlife.”
“Justin
Trudeau and his Liberal team have ignored much of the important work that is
being done in local communities to protect, conserve, and manage our
environment due to their “Ottawa knows best” approach,” said Rempel. 
In A Real Plan to Protect our Environment, restoring the Hunting and Angling Advisory Panel is just one of many initiatives focused on increasing community involvement and positioning the government alongside Canadians to work together to promote a cleaner and greener natural environment. There are so many Canadians who work diligently to fight climate change and protect our environment. Canada’s Conservatives want to make sure that your voice is heard, that you have a seat at the table, and that the government is working with you.

Conservatives: “Justin Trudeau is not as advertised. This

Trudeau, and a new, positive Conservative government that will take immediate
action for you to get ahead.”

Yesterday the Conservative Party received
notice from lawyers representing the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
informing us they would be suing over the use of news clips in a Conservative
Party social media video.
The Conservative Party has grave concern that this decision was made on the eve of an election that CBC is to be covering fairly and objectively. The Conservative Party considers this a complete distraction in the final days of a tightly contested election, and we will dispute this lawsuit fully.
The video in question was removed from our platforms well
before CBC lawyers made the decision to file their lawsuit.
The 17 seconds of CBC clips in the video included Andrew
Coyne highlighting how Justin Trudeau broke the law, Justin Trudeau telling a
Canadian war veteran that he is “asking for more than we can give right now”,
and one CBC reporter questioning why the Liberals provided Loblaws with $12
million in tax dollars to install new refrigerators.
CBC is a taxpayer-funded entity, tasked with covering this
election fairly and objectively. Canadians pay the funding CBC receives.
Canadians pay the salaries for those employed at CBC. Simply, Canadians own
CBC.
When you are funded entirely by taxpayer dollars,
taxpayers should be able to use the footage.
The Copyright Act provides for fair dealing.
Elections Canada provided further clarification on a
September 11th posting to their website, namely:
Question 35. Can a political ad contain a “news clip” without the approval of the broadcaster? Answer:  Prior to the election period, broadcasters can decline to run a political ad on any grounds they choose, provided they treat all parties on an equitable basis.  However, during the election period, they are not entitled to decline an ad unless the broadcast would be in contravention of the law.  If a news clip is relatively short and is not a substantial part of the audiovisual work from which it was taken, the broadcast of the news clip in a political ad would not infringe the copyright of the owner of the audiovisual work and would not require the permission of that owner to be broadcast.
Instead, CBC is using taxpayer dollars to sue a major
political party ten days before a national election in this country.

On behalf of Canada’s Conservatives, Mike
Lake candidate for Edmonton – Wetaskiwin released the following statement:
“There is an estimated 1 in 66 Canadians aged 5 to 17 who
are diagnosed with autism. Across Canada, families work tirelessly to support
their children and care for their loved ones. Evidence-based therapies and
services can cost up to $80,000 per year for children with high needs. The
financial costs added to missed work, drives to appointments, and late nights
all add up.
“At present, across the country, provinces and territories
struggle to meet the growing needs of the autism community. There are
jurisdictional inequalities in service deliveries that force families to move
or seek services away from home.
“Canada’s Conservatives believe that the federal
government can play an important role in developing a strategy to assist those
living with autism and their families. As Prime Minister, Andrew Scheer will
work with autism stakeholders to develop a National Autism Strategy.
“An initial investment of $50 million over five years
would be invested to develop a comprehensive strategy in consultation with
autistic individuals, autism organizations, provincial, territorial, and
municipal governments, and indigenous communities. The National Autism Strategy
will be person-centred, include first-person perspectives, will be culturally
appropriate, and will reflect the needs of Canada’s northern, rural, and remote
communities.
“This is an important first step to support Canadians’
access to meaningful support and resources to live to their full potential, no
matter where they live.
“A new Conservative government will work together with
autism organizations across Canada, and the greater autism community to address
the needs of the autism community so they can live their best life possible.”

Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act could help 35,000 more Canadians with disabilities
A new Conservative government will introduce the Fairness for
Persons with Disabilities Act, allowing 35,000 more Canadians to qualify and
apply for the Disability Tax Credit, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer
announced today. 
This new Act will reduce the number of hours spent per week on
life-sustaining therapy needed to qualify for the credit from 14 to 10. It will
also expand the definition of what counts as life-sustaining therapy to include
determining dosages of medical food and activities related to determining dosages
of medication, including dietary or exercise regimes. This would allow 35,000
more Canadians with disabilities the potential to access savings of an average
of $2,100 a year.
“A new Conservative government will support Canadians with
disabilities in ways that leave more money in their pockets to help them manage
their health needs,” Scheer said. “We will make sure that Canadians with a
disability can care for themselves and parents of children with disabilities can
support their children without worrying about their bottom line.”
Under our policy, a Canadian with type
1 diabetes who currently spends an average of 10 hours per week managing his or
her condition would qualify for the Disability Tax Credit.
In 2017, Justin Trudeau changed how Canadians qualify for the
Disability Tax Credit and the Registered Disability Savings Plan, stripping
important financial support from thousands of Canadians with disabilities.
“Trudeau
has made life more expensive for all Canadians, including those with
disabilities,” Scheer said. “A new Conservative government will live within its
means. We will lower your taxes and put more money in your pocket so you can worry
less about your bottom line and focus on living life to your full potential.” 
Conservative MP Tom Kmiec introduced the Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act in 2018 but the bill did
not pass before parliament was dissolved.

New Conservative government to bring
real accountability and transparency to government 
A new
Conservative government will introduce legislation to attach stiff penalties
for violating ethics laws and strengthen the powers of parliamentary watchdogs
during its first 100 days, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announced today.
Scheer said he
will establish penalties for violations of the Conflict of Interest Act that do not currently carry penalties. The
penalties will be proportional to the severity of the violation and the
seniority of the offender and they will carry a maximum fine of $20,000. This
includes the sections of the Act that
deal with conflict of interest, preferential treatment, insider information, influence,
accepting gifts and other violations. 
“When you break
ethics laws, as Justin Trudeau has done twice, there should be real
consequences,” Scheer said. “As Prime Minister, I will make sure politicians
who break the law to benefit themselves and their friends will pay a heavy
price.”
When Finance
Minister Bill Morneau failed to disclose his villa in France to the Ethics
Commissioner, he was only forced to pay a fine of $200. 
When Justin
Trudeau was found guilty of violating the Conflict
of Interest Act for accepting a free vacation to the Aga Khan’s private
island and for interfering in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, there were
no penalties at all.
“Canadians
expect accountability when their leaders violate the law and violate their
trust and that’s what I will deliver,” Scheer said.
Currently, the
maximum fine for breaching the Conflict
of Interest Act is five hundred dollars, and only applies when public
office holders fail to meet reporting requirements. 
A new Conservative government will also restore accountability and
transparency in government by:
Increasing oversight powers of the Ethics
Commissioner and Lobbying Commissioner Strengthening lobbying restrictions Closing the loophole in the Conflict of Interest
Act that allows the indirect holding of shares by Cabinet ministersIntroducing legislative reforms for whistleblowers 
Scheer has already announced he will hold a judicial inquiry into the
SNC-Lavalin scandal and pass the No More
Cover Ups Act, which will prevent corrupt politicians from using Cabinet
confidence to cover up their scandals.
“In 2015,
Justin Trudeau promised he would be ethical and accountable. Every day since
then, he has proven that he is not as advertised,” Scheer said. “Time and time
again, he and his Ministers have abused the power of their office for their own
personal gain. A Prime Minister who so willingly deceives and breaks the law
simply cannot be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of governing
for Canada.”
On October 21, Canadians
have a choice between Justin Trudeau who abuses his power, bends the law for
his friends, attempts to silence his critics and destroys their reputations – and
a Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer who will uphold the rule of law,
respect our democratic institutions, and help all Canadians get ahead.
FACTS: 
The
Conflict of Interest Act was
introduced by the previous Conservative government through the Federal Accountability Act, replacing
the Conflict of Interest and
Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders.Currently
Canada’s Conflict of Interest Act “does not provide for any sanctions
for breaches found following an examination by the conflict of interest and
ethics commissioner.”The
only penalties the Ethics Commissioner has the power to impose under the Act are “administrative monetary
penalties,” which only apply when public office holders fail to meet
reporting requirements.

disparaging comments toward women
Yesterday Postmedia exposed numerous sexist
comments by Justin Trudeau’s handpicked candidate in Sydney-Victoria, Jamie
Battiste, which were made between 2012-2016.
While some of Battiste’s comments are too inappropriate to
repeat, he joked about sexually assaulting women and believes their role is to
clean, cook and fold laundry.
These comments are disgusting and inexcusable. An
individual who makes this many disparaging comments is not worthy of sitting in
the House of Commons. 
“Despite these sexist comments, Battiste is allowed to run
as a Liberal candidate for Justin Trudeau,” said Lisa Raitt, Conservative
candidate for Milton. “Justin Trudeau is a fake feminist. Whether it was
groping a journalist in British Columbia, or throwing strong women out of his
caucus for standing up for the rule-of-law, Trudeau never lives up to his own
self-proclaimed feminism.”    
Justin Trudeau says he’s a feminist, but as we have seen
time and time again his own decisions and actions speak louder than his words.

Liberals continue to attack whistleblowers and bully
critics who stands up to their corrupt behaviour
Ottawa, Ontario – The media are reporting that a whistleblower was let go by a Trudeau cabinet minister after the whistleblower tried to flag concerns about a conflict of interest. According to the media, the Liberal Government appointed Moreen Miller as the new Chair of the of Defence Construction Canada (DCC). The only problem is that Ms. Miller continued her role as President of Fowler, a firm that bids on DCC contracts.  Only now, after once again being exposed, the Government was forced to order an ‘urgent’ investigation into the file. This, on the eve of an election.  This is a pattern. First Vice-Admiral Mark Norman was thrown under the bus for raising concerns about the Trudeau government’s unethical behaviour. Then Jody-Wilson Raybould was fired for raising concerns about the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal.  Now a third whistleblower has been let go for flagging a conflict of interest.  It’s obvious that there are one set of rules for Trudeau and his friends, and another set of rules for the rest of us.  Justin Trudeau cannot be trusted and if he is re-elected he will continue to break laws and grant insider access to Liberals and corporate lobbyists.  Under Prime Minister Andrew Scheer the corruption in Ottawa will end. It starts with a judicial inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal and introducing the No More Cover Ups Act to allow the RCMP to access information protected by cabinet confidence.

Justin Trudeau signed letter endorsing a Liberal-NDP coalition in 2008, just months after first being elected as a Member of Parliament
Justin Trudeau will pay any price to hold
onto power. He was willing to do it in 2008 and he is willing to do it now.
As a newly elected Member of Parliament in 2008, one of
Justin Trudeau’s first orders of business was to sign a letter to the Governor
General announcing his support and participation in a Liberal-Bloc-NDP
coalition. https://cpcassets.conservative.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15120538/0d1734dbea4f1b5.pdf
In fact, according to Brian Topp, one of the chief
negotiators of the coalition was Trudeau’s most trusted advisor, Katie Telford.
The 2008 coalition, like the coalition Trudeau refuses to
rule out with Jagmeet Singh, would have led to economic disaster in Canada with
skyrocketing taxes and mass unemployment. 
Canadians cannot trust Justin Trudeau. If he won’t rule
out a coalition with the NDP, it’s because he has a secret plan to do it when
he is defeated. If Trudeau has no plan to join a coalition, why won’t he simply
say it? 
Trudeau is already promising higher taxes and bigger
deficits if he’s re-elected. Imagine how much more you will pay with Trudeau
held hostage by the NDP.
The NDP’s price for propping up Trudeau will be even
higher taxes, more reckless spending, fewer jobs, bigger deficits, and more
debt.
The choice is clear. A Liberal-NDP coalition that will
cost you thousands of dollars more, or a Conservative government that will live
within its means and put more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.
